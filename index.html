<div class="post-content"><p>The canonical RSS feed for this blog has now moved to <a href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/feed/">http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/feed/</a>.  I was reusing the Feedburners from my previous blogs, but this is now going to be a permanent redirect to the feed URL hosted by this blog only, and should carry on working.  I don&rsquo;t want to rely on the Feedburner service that has not been updated for a long time and I&rsquo;m not convinced it will be around forever.</p>

<p>You can also take it from me that it is a vanilla XML file generated by Octopress which means no traffic analysis (in fact this blog doesn&rsquo;t even have any analytics hooked up to it deliberately).</p>

<p>Sorry for any inconvenience!</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>For a new job, a spring clean.  The blog has been renamed <a href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/">Fragmented Memory</a> with its own domain.</p>

<p>This blog used to be on <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.co.uk/">Blogger</a> and then <a href="http://www.programmerslog.com/">self-hosted Wordpress</a> and then back to <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.co.uk/">Blogger</a>.  In my laziness about renewing the self-hosted solution I lost most of the content, then I found my backup from just before that implosion.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m joining the cool kids with static blogging using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> (hosted on <a href="http://www.github.com/">Github Pages</a>) and merged all the posts from my Blogger and Wordpress instances.  This actually amounts to 500 posts which I imagine is pretty out of date.  Expect some posts about how to migrate from these in the future.  I&rsquo;ll be spending some time grabbing the images and other content and hosting it correctly.</p>

This is a weird thing I never thought I would write in my career, but I&#8217;m joining Microsoft.&nbsp; There is a new games studio called <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-10-microsoft-announces-lift-london-a-new-developer-focused-on-cloud-games-for-tablets-mobiles-and-tvs">Lift London</a> and I knew someone working there.&nbsp; So my CV (well, Stack Overflow Careers profile) winged its way to their desks, and before I knew it I decided to join them.&nbsp; It helps everyone I spoke to was impressive, sincere, humble and have the same hunger for learning and doing things right.<br /><br />Then the paperwork started to come through for me to sign, and it suddenly dawned on me I was joining Microsoft(!)&nbsp; The logos were a dead giveaway.&nbsp; This is extremely weird for me because although my work at <a href="http://www.bromium.com/">Bromium</a> was predominantly Windows I spent a long time working on Linux (and Mac OSX in some shape or form).&nbsp; I also totally believe in open-source because whenever I can I tried to make sure (things I felt were) important were properly released.&nbsp; Github makes that easy.&nbsp; So you could argue I&#8217;m not a natural fit for Microsoft.<br /><br />I have faith after meeting my interviewees at Lift London that those things I read about working at Microsoft will not be an issue.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a very exciting game studio in a very exciting place doing  special things within the Microsoft portfolio (going places that will be  controversial).&nbsp; I never did work for appraisals, ladder-climbing, etc.&nbsp; I did it to learn more, to improve, and to most importantly help others and the team to achieve.&nbsp; Nothing satisfies more than exceeding a customer&#8217;s expectations and delivering work on time.<br /><br />24th June I will begin my brutal commute to London to start a new and exciting adventure.&nbsp; My role will be on server-side tech, and with a security remit.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see where this goes.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re interested in working for a game company trying new things contact me through <a href="https://twitter.com/garrybodsworth">Twitter @garrybodsworth</a> or email or check out the <a href="http://www.microsoft-careers.com/go/IEB-United-Kingdom/343318/?filter=true&amp;title=lift">vacancies here</a>.</div>

Last week I was representing Bromium at the Hacker News London event, and there was an excellent talk by Philip Su from Facebook&#8217;s London office. &nbsp;It was about the engineering culture at Facebook and how they have kept it working up to their current 1000 engineers. &nbsp;Whatever you think of Facebook this is a great window into how they have kept the engineering culture thriving and fully operational despite the issues of engineer numbers and the scale of their operations.<br /><br />Also, Philip Su is a really great speaker.<br /><br />&nbsp;  <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" mozallowfullscreen="" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/60896034" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"></iframe><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/60896034">Philip Su: Site Lead at Facebook - Engineering process and philosophy at Facebook</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/hnlondon">HN London</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</div>

Before I gave up drawing around 17/18 (nearly 18 years ago) I was working on a strip that I was hoping to be published in a new Lee Davies (he of the old UK fanzine Mondo) publication. &nbsp;So I came up with a whole series bible and a set of comic strips in this universe. &nbsp;Unfortunately part of the reason for giving up on comics was the publication never started and&nbsp;I didn&#8217;t think I was good enough (looking back I was a little harsh on myself).<br /><br />I had all these pages gathering dust for nearly 20 years(!) &nbsp;Noone else has seen them apart from me when I was drawing them. &nbsp;Apart from Transformers fanzines I seem to have not successsfully managed to publish any comics, so I have loads of strips in varying states of completedness. &nbsp;Please bear in mind this was done in 1995-ish so such wonders of computers I was using but manually pasting up because it was another year before I had a suitable DTP package.<br /><br />For <a href="http://www.stephendowneygallery.com/2013/02/creator-owned-day-2013.html">Creator Owned Day</a> I&#8217;ve decided to scan them in. &nbsp;Without further ado is <b>Genocide: Duostar</b> unleashed

<br />Creator Owned Day was started by <a href="http://www.stephendowneygallery.com/2013/02/creator-owned-day-2013.html">Stephen Downey here</a> and its primary purpose is for creators to start new ideas and not simply dream of working on corporate owned comics. &nbsp;You can follow it by on <a href="https://twitter.com/creatorownedday">Twitter @CreatorOwnedDay</a> or the hashtag #CreatorOwnedDay. &nbsp;Also check out the great list of <a href="http://www.amberunmasked.com/2013-creatorownedday/">creator owned comics here</a>.<br /><br />Since I am off work I decided to participate this year, which is great synchronicity otherwise I&#8217;d never get around to drawing again. &nbsp;And for some reason rather than just creating a character I went the whole &#8220;high concept&#8221; route, nothing like over-stretching. &nbsp;Seems I have finished more or less by lunch time.<br /><br />So here it is&#8230;.<br /><h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Science Park</span></h3><div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garrybodsworth/8530244343/" title="sciencepark by Garry Bodsworth, on Flickr"><img alt="sciencepark" height="500" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8087/8530244343_2a3e6252aa.jpg" width="369" /></a><br /><div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div>A technology park just outside Cambridge located in a hollowed out mountain and deep towards the Earth&#8217;s crust. &nbsp;Rental rates are pretty good and there are a wide choice of office sizes. &nbsp;The park is privately funded by The L Corporation and their mysterious CEO who lives and works in the penthouse suite at the top of the mountain.<br /><h4>Tenants include:</h4><b>Immutable Corporation</b><br /><b>Motto:</b> We&#8217;ve Always Been Here<br /><b>Employees:</b> 4000<br /><b>Specialities:</b> Computer equipment<br /><b>CEO:</b> Dr Monolith<br /><br /><b>B.I.O.</b><br /><b>Motto:</b> Recreating The Past<br /><b>Employees:</b> 10,000<br /><b>Specialities:</b> Bio-tech<br /><b>CEO:</b> Mr Silence PhD (please contact his PA Mr D Lackey)<br /><h4>Rival Science Parks:</h4>Giant Robo Science Park<br /><b>Advantages:</b> Mobile<br /><b>Disadvantages:</b> Mobile, you might lose your office.<br />Giant Robo Science Park is the latest state of the art giant robot with an attitude problem. &nbsp;Loaded with weaponry enjoys spending its days blowing holes in the hollowed out mountain.<br /><br />Ignore the giant hands, I&#8217;m sure that it is just a cloud formation.<br /><br /><h3>Why Did I Do This?</h3>This is always a case of stick to what you know, and my intention was to do something based aroud the technology industry. &nbsp;Judging from what I have created it is not necessarily based on real-life, and the irony of a mountain in Cambridgeshire is extreme. &nbsp;I apologise for the Kirby-isms, the dinosaur was not supposed to look that Kirby-like, I promise I have never read Devil Dinosaur (something I do plan to rectify). &nbsp;The giant robot is also my way of shoehorning my addiction to Transformers in there.<br /><br />What do I want to do next? &nbsp;I hope I can find the time to work on this as it has given me focus for ideas.</div></div>

It has been a crazy week where at the beginning nothing existed and on Friday the project was demoed live with all the functionality working. &nbsp;In this compressed five day lifecycle it brought into sharp clarity &nbsp;many aspects of software development. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve always been able to estimate project length but there was no science in it, I always operated on gut feeling and put in healthy margins of error.<br /><br />I was one of the cogs in this project but before I go into breaking down the project there were some other factors helping this development be a success:<br /><br /><ul><li>Someone leading the project who made sure requirements were locked down and made sure there was no feature creep (within reason).</li><li>Testers were on from day one, planning how to test and then seeing through all manner of test regimens.</li><li>Working with smart people.</li><li>Good tools for source code management, documentation, and bug tracking.</li></ul><div>The thing that was really scary for me as a project was how my time broke down:</div><div><ul><li>1 day coding</li><li>2 days integration</li><li>2 days testing and polishing</li></ul><div>The critical aspect here is I spent one day out of five working on pure code and design. &nbsp;This should be apparent to developers that coding is not the only task in delivering software projects. &nbsp;By getting something that was working in half a day also gave other people something real to code against rather than trying to hope integration would happen.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>The next bit was two days of integration, this involved tidying up the code for deployment, working out installers, dependencies and so on. &nbsp;Then also it was a case of working out how all of this will work seamlessly for the end user. &nbsp;This also involved working out how certain bits of the operating system would work when you don&#8217;t have user contexts to depend on that run as administrator, because after all most devs have their machines configured like this. &nbsp;Having this installer is critical for running proper end to end tests and ensuring the end-user will get the best experience.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then we&#8217;ve got testing, this is unit-testing (well actually not a lot of that in a way), functional testing, and integration testing. On a tight deadline some of this is manual and not fully automated.</div><div><br /></div><div>In amongst all this it was a case of making sure documentation was available for all aspects of the project, from end-user, through development and API right through to testing documents and lists of tests.</div><div><br /></div><div>I suppose this thing that people reading this is if you work out how long it will take you to code, multiply that by five.</div></div>

Yesterday <a href="http://www.bromium.com/">Bromium </a>(the company, not what the product will be) came out of stealth mode.&nbsp; This was a very exciting time around the office because we can give a bit more context on what we&#8217;ve been secretly working away on.<br /><br />During the proceeding months before this release of information a huge amount of work was going on behind the scenes briefing analysts and news outlets by our top team of Gaurav, Simon, Ian, Tal, and many more.&nbsp; The avalanche of coverage actually happened to have been prepared a while in advance.<br /><br />You can see Simon Crosby&#8217;s presentation &#8220;Secure Everything&#8221; from GigaOM Structure <a href="http://www.livestream.com/gigaomstructure/video?clipId=pla_44bb05bf-522b-4003-aab3-25f76827fe2f">here</a> and also the Q&amp;A interview afterwards <a href="http://www.livestream.com/gigaomstructure/video?clipId=pla_9668f060-4355-41c7-a573-d648277bbe7e">here</a>.&nbsp; This lays the groundwork for the approach to security that we have pursued at Bromium.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.bromium.com/">new website</a> also went live with a couple of videos explaining what we are building.&nbsp; Lots of new terminology like Microvisors.<br /><br />A few good articles about Bromium are on <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/06/crosby-bromium-microvisor/">Wired</a> and also <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-06-20/bromiums-tiny-prisons-for-malware">BloombergBusinessWeek</a>.&nbsp; The Register has an <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/06/20/bromium_microvisor_security/">excellent piece here</a>.<br /><br />In the meantime I&#8217;m going to be plugging away writing code as we hurtle towards our next announcements that will reveal the actual product!</div>
