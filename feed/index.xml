&lt;p&gt;This blog used to be on &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.co.uk/"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="http://www.programmerslog.com/"&gt;self-hosted Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; and then back to &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.co.uk/"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Then the paperwork started to come through for me to sign, and it suddenly dawned on me I was joining Microsoft(!)&amp;nbsp; The logos were a dead giveaway.&amp;nbsp; This is extremely weird for me because although my work at &lt;a href="http://www.bromium.com/"&gt;Bromium&lt;/a&gt; was predominantly Windows I spent a long time working on Linux (and Mac OSX in some shape or form).&amp;nbsp; I also totally believe in open-source because whenever I can I tried to make sure (things I felt were) important were properly released.&amp;nbsp; Github makes that easy.&amp;nbsp; So you could argue I'm not a natural fit for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have faith after meeting my interviewees at Lift London that those things I read about working at Microsoft will not be an issue.&amp;nbsp; It's a very exciting game studio in a very exciting place doing  special things within the Microsoft portfolio (going places that will be  controversial).&amp;nbsp; I never did work for appraisals, ladder-climbing, etc.&amp;nbsp; I did it to learn more, to improve, and to most importantly help others and the team to achieve.&amp;nbsp; Nothing satisfies more than exceeding a customer's expectations and delivering work on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24th June I will begin my brutal commute to London to start a new and exciting adventure.&amp;nbsp; My role will be on server-side tech, and with a security remit.&amp;nbsp; It will be interesting to see where this goes.&amp;nbsp; If you're interested in working for a game company trying new things contact me through &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/garrybodsworth"&gt;Twitter @garrybodsworth&lt;/a&gt; or email or check out the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft-careers.com/go/IEB-United-Kingdom/343318/?filter=true&amp;amp;title=lift"&gt;vacancies here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Leaving Bromium</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2013/06/13/leaving-bromium.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-13T16:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2013-06-13:blog/2013/06/13/leaving-bromium.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was my last day at Bromium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had all these pages gathering dust for nearly 20 years(!) &amp;nbsp;Noone else has seen them apart from me when I was drawing them. &amp;nbsp;Apart from Transformers fanzines I seem to have not successsfully managed to publish any comics, so I have loads of strips in varying states of completedness. &amp;nbsp;Please bear in mind this was done in 1995-ish so such wonders of computers I was using but manually pasting up because it was another year before I had a suitable DTP package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="http://www.stephendowneygallery.com/2013/02/creator-owned-day-2013.html"&gt;Creator Owned Day&lt;/a&gt; I've decided to scan them in. &amp;nbsp;Without further ado is &lt;b&gt;Genocide: Duostar&lt;/b&gt; unleashed on an unsuspecting world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the original version that I completely re-wrote and re-drew when I wasn't happy with it and after getting a script critique. &amp;nbsp;This is a lot splashier and influenced by US comics, but the version above was much tighter and more 2000AD which is far closer to my sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignore the giant hands, I'm sure that it is just a cloud formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Did I Do This?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is always a case of stick to what you know, and my intention was to do something based aroud the technology industry. &amp;nbsp;Judging from what I have created it is not necessarily based on real-life, and the irony of a mountain in Cambridgeshire is extreme. &amp;nbsp;I apologise for the Kirby-isms, the dinosaur was not supposed to look that Kirby-like, I promise I have never read Devil Dinosaur (something I do plan to rectify). &amp;nbsp;The giant robot is also my way of shoehorning my addiction to Transformers in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I want to do next? &amp;nbsp;I hope I can find the time to work on this as it has given me focus for ideas.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Estimating Development Time?</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2012/09/30/estimating-development-time.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-30T19:55:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2012-09-30:blog/2012/09/30/estimating-development-time.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div class='post'&gt;
It has been a crazy week where at the beginning nothing existed and on Friday the project was demoed live with all the functionality working. &amp;nbsp;In this compressed five day lifecycle it brought into sharp clarity &amp;nbsp;many aspects of software development. &amp;nbsp;I've always been able to estimate project length but there was no science in it, I always operated on gut feeling and put in healthy margins of error.

I was one of the cogs in this project but before I go into breaking down the project there were some other factors helping this development be a success:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Someone leading the project who made sure requirements were locked down and made sure there was no feature creep (within reason).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testers were on from day one, planning how to test and then seeing through all manner of test regimens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with smart people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good tools for source code management, documentation, and bug tracking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;The thing that was really scary for me as a project was how my time broke down:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 day coding&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 days integration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 days testing and polishing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;The critical aspect here is I spent one day out of five working on pure code and design. &amp;nbsp;This should be apparent to developers that coding is not the only task in delivering software projects. &amp;nbsp;By getting something that was working in half a day also gave other people something real to code against rather than trying to hope integration would happen.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The next bit was two days of integration, this involved tidying up the code for deployment, working out installers, dependencies and so on. &amp;nbsp;Then also it was a case of working out how all of this will work seamlessly for the end user. &amp;nbsp;This also involved working out how certain bits of the operating system would work when you don't have user contexts to depend on that run as administrator, because after all most devs have their machines configured like this. &amp;nbsp;Having this installer is critical for running proper end to end tests and ensuring the end-user will get the best experience.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then we've got testing, this is unit-testing (well actually not a lot of that in a way), functional testing, and integration testing. On a tight deadline some of this is manual and not fully automated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In amongst all this it was a case of making sure documentation was available for all aspects of the project, from end-user, through development and API right through to testing documents and lists of tests.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I suppose this thing that people reading this is if you work out how long it will take you to code, multiply that by five.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Bromium Man</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2012/06/22/bromium-man.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-22T08:54:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2012-06-22:blog/2012/06/22/bromium-man.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The whiteboard scribble I did to celebrate getting out of stealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the proceeding months before this release of information a huge amount of work was going on behind the scenes briefing analysts and news outlets by our top team of Gaurav, Simon, Ian, Tal, and many more.&amp;nbsp; The avalanche of coverage actually happened to have been prepared a while in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see Simon Crosby's presentation "Secure Everything" from GigaOM Structure &lt;a href="http://www.livestream.com/gigaomstructure/video?clipId=pla_44bb05bf-522b-4003-aab3-25f76827fe2f"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and also the Q&amp;amp;A interview afterwards &lt;a href="http://www.livestream.com/gigaomstructure/video?clipId=pla_9668f060-4355-41c7-a573-d648277bbe7e"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This lays the groundwork for the approach to security that we have pursued at Bromium.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;a href="http://www.bromium.com/"&gt;new website&lt;/a&gt; also went live with a couple of videos explaining what we are building.&amp;nbsp; Lots of new terminology like Microvisors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few good articles about Bromium are on &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/06/crosby-bromium-microvisor/"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-06-20/bromiums-tiny-prisons-for-malware"&gt;BloombergBusinessWeek&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The Register has an &lt;a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/06/20/bromium_microvisor_security/"&gt;excellent piece here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I'm going to be plugging away writing code as we hurtle towards our next announcements that will reveal the actual product!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Bromium - T-Minus Four Days</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2012/06/16/bromium-t-minus-four-days.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-16T21:05:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2012-06-16:blog/2012/06/16/bromium-t-minus-four-days.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this year I started my new role at a stealth start-up called Bromium.&amp;nbsp; What can be said about it is we are building a next generation virtualisation product for security.&amp;nbsp; The exciting thing is that we are now only four days away from the public announcement about what we have been working on.&amp;nbsp; This will be at the at the GigaOM Structure conference in San Francisco where our CTO &lt;a href="http://event.gigaom.com/structure/speakers/#simon_crosby"&gt;Simon Crosby&lt;/a&gt; will be doing a talk called "Secure Everything" (&lt;a href="http://event.gigaom.com/structure/schedule/"&gt;schedule here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been an interesting and hectic time here at Bromium.&amp;nbsp; Lots of good news in the past month.&amp;nbsp; We should be in a new office by the end of this month with lots more space.&amp;nbsp; A new &lt;a href="http://mynameismwd.org/index.php?id=872"&gt;Director Of OS X Products&lt;/a&gt; going to start soon in the Cambridge office, which now means two-thirds of the &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/naughton/2515581935/in/photostream"&gt;Shed dwellers from Camvine&lt;/a&gt; have ended up at Bromium.&amp;nbsp; We also have several new people starting over the next month, which is great news because they are all extremely talented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spent a lot of time over the past few months doing job fairs and interviews as we try to build a strong Cambridge team.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;a href="http://www.siliconmilkroundcambridge.com/"&gt;Silicon Milkround in Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; was not as successful as we would have hoped, but we got a few interesting things out of it.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;a href="http://siliconmilkroundabout.com/"&gt;Silicon Milkround&lt;/a&gt; in London was a roaring success with some crazy amount of CVs and contacts (I think the figure was 40-50) and if you were there you might have seen me do a two minute pitch for the company.&amp;nbsp; These events I swear were some of the hardest work I've ever done, but really fun and satisfying, I can guarantee I slept well afterwards.&amp;nbsp; We spent a lot of time sorting through all, this has meant I've done about 20 interviews over the past month which is a good way to fry your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Bromium it feels like we can't use the term brogrammers which has been co-opted by others.&amp;nbsp; And to prove that I am not I got minus 165 on &lt;a href="http://areyouabrogrammer.com/"&gt;Are You A Brogrammer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a developer, test engineer, or an OS X developer and fancy the challenge of your career drop me a line or mail &lt;a href="mailto:jobs.uk@bromium.com"&gt;jobs.uk@bromium.com&lt;/a&gt; - we are still &lt;a href="http://www.bromium.com/careers.html"&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the 20th June it will be an exciting prospect to actually tell people what I've been working on!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The real important feature of C++</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2012/04/09/real-important-feature-of-c.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-04-09T21:13:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2012-04-09:blog/2012/04/09/real-important-feature-of-c.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been having to write a lot of C code recently, and it makes me pine for some features of C++ because of the verbosity of some portions of code. It made me consider what really changes the way you code in C++ on comparison to C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are features like inheritance, but that really just manages the function overriding that is implicit.  There is templates whilst discounting template meta programming is just a glorified way of avoiding code duplication.  There is obviously the more aggressive type checking which is handy but doesn't really change that much about your coding style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is this feature?  Destructors.  Immediately by adding that feature you change the way you can code and also by avoiding some C verbosity you avoid memory leaks.  This opens up the whole realm of RAII and the code scoping rules start to take on a different life because you can execute code when objects begin to fall out of scope and are freed.  This code then kind of discourages gotos (I really hate those) because you are relying more on the stack unwinding than remembering to malloc/free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I reckon if I had destructors for the C code I have written in the context of structs then I could have had a lot less code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have obviously heard of the Raspberry Pi but mid-to-lat 2011 there was anotehr project starting with a company called &lt;a href="http://rhombus-tech.net/"&gt;Rhombus-Tech&lt;/a&gt; where they wanted to create a proper CPU card and also have all the software GPL compliant.&amp;nbsp; This is exciting because you can then get the hardware and with the software available create what you want to.&amp;nbsp; They went around trying to find the hardware that could potentially have GPL compliant software.&amp;nbsp; The project has become a CPU card that uses the legacy PCMCIA form factor but re-tasks it entirely for a pluggable processor.&amp;nbsp; The spec is called the &lt;a href="http://elinux.org/Embedded_Open_Modular_Architecture/EOMA-68"&gt;EOMA-68&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the Allwinner A10, a seriously cheap piece of kit ($7 per chip in volume) which is a Cortex A8 with MALI 400 graphics, DDR3 memory and has a BSP capable of decoding 2160p video.&amp;nbsp; The company behind it Allwinner want to be GPL compliant and have been providing source code for the kernel and the other bits.&amp;nbsp; The A10 has started to appear in tablets and set-top boxes and the fully integrated platforms are very cheap.&amp;nbsp; I picked a capacitive touch 7 inch tablet off eBay for £86 including next day postage.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;a href="http://www.cnx-software.com/2012/03/20/allwinner-a10-cortex-a8-based-hackable-mele-a1000-android-stb/"&gt;Mele A1000&lt;/a&gt; set top box is the platform of choice that people have started to pre-emptively use whilst waiting for the Rhombus Tech project to take off and it costs about £80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rhombus Tech spec for the Allwinner A10 is &lt;a href="http://rhombus-tech.net/allwinner_a10/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and you can sign up for &lt;a href="http://rhombus-tech.net/allwinner_a10/orders/"&gt;preorders for the alpha/beta/release boards here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the real exciting bit about this is potentially all the software is out there to construct a decent Linux distribution to build toys and products on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main kernel development and tidying up is occurring &lt;a href="https://github.com/amery/linux-allwinner"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and is even being rebased on the 3.3 kenel as well as the Android one.&amp;nbsp; The u-boot repository for getting it booting is &lt;a href="https://github.com/amery/uboot-allwinner"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; There is a partial code dump for the hardware video decoding &lt;a href="https://github.com/amery/allwinner-a10-video"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; although it looks like it is some of the user space code.&amp;nbsp; There are some repositories of core Android libraries &lt;a href="https://github.com/arpandeb"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and there are some board files for the Allwinner &lt;a href="https://github.com/arpandeb/allwinner_board_files"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It looks like in the board files there is the OpenGL ES 2.0 and EGL shared objects &lt;a href="https://github.com/arpandeb/allwinner_board_files/tree/master/crane-common/egl"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also a couple of good articles about building a custom Android for Allwinner A10 based appliances - &lt;a href="http://arpandeb.com/03/2012/tech-guides/how-to-build-custom-rom-for-allwinner-a10-based-android-tablets-a-tutorial-and-guide.html"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://arpandeb.com/03/2012/android-how-to-guides/how-to-build-custom-rom-for-allwinner-a10-based-android-tablets-part-ii.html"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; There are also lots of resources for board hacking at the &lt;a href="http://rhombus-tech.net/"&gt;Rhombus Tech&lt;/a&gt; website and also some on the &lt;a href="http://elinux.org/Hack_A10_devices"&gt;Embedded Linux wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you fancy some cheap ARM development its worth signing up on the &lt;a href="http://rhombus-tech.net/allwinner_a10/orders/"&gt;orders page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would I have rather have done with those three-and-a-half years?&amp;nbsp; Nothing else.&amp;nbsp; It'll be in my blood for a while longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HIGH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did the Cambridge Tech Demo Night.&amp;nbsp; Quentin had prepared lots of slides to cram into 7 minutes, and I was going to simultaneously do a full unboxing from scratch (with no cheating) simultaneously to how how easy it was to set up.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately projector connection failure caused us to throw out the slides and Quentin fired up a web browser on some Windows machine that was part of the University network that by default was controlling the projector.&amp;nbsp; He talked, fired up the browser and I started unboxing and connecting cables, within about three minutes we were connected, registered and uploading content to the display.&amp;nbsp; The projector failure was the best thing to happen to us because we showed the product end-to-end in such a short period, we even got a standing ovation - scary and heartwarming stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was always asked to evaluate a new hardware platform, which I would get working.&amp;nbsp; Then I was always expected to support it without any hardware because £200 was too much to keep a small PC around.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately for other things like Windows licences the company was able to pour money down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HIGH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a crazy test rig.&amp;nbsp; It involved a full server in a Xen VM with two NICs so there was a fake Internet hanging off the back of it.&amp;nbsp; This was always our saviour, we insstantly knew if software updates or networking were broken because we had the physical hardware dangling off the back, not some mock representation.&amp;nbsp; This obviously couldn't save all problems but it meant the customers rarely saw a broken release.&amp;nbsp; It was horrible and verbose, but I saw the power in it being an integral part of the software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did we have the major SSD failure of 2011, we had them replaced.&amp;nbsp; Then they died again, but this was a quick hotswap because we did not trust the management services we were paying for any more.&amp;nbsp; What I also discovered was the server grade Intel drives were actually cheap'n'nasty Crucials for consumers.&amp;nbsp; Because of the work I did reducing the database load we were completely fine back on spinny disks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HIGH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on Linux full-time.&amp;nbsp; Working on Mac full-time.&amp;nbsp; Going nowhere near Windows.&amp;nbsp; And making sure my Macs and Linux machines had awesome decals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopping working on the Mac.&amp;nbsp; I realised I was using a VM with Linux the whole time on my Mac so I got myself an Asus U36JC which was an awesome laptop that I had configured perfectly for Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HIGH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewriting the network stack to be pure Python.&amp;nbsp; The code is all here https://github.com/garrybodsworth/coda_network - this means NTLM proxies worked, streaming worked, and all the intricacies of networking worked as they were supposed to.&amp;nbsp; Although I never got an official document to say I could open-source it, I did it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows player.&amp;nbsp; As alluded to we had to have a Windows player and the whole feature creep and ignoring my initial specification documents helped make it a disaster.&amp;nbsp; To be honest, I have no problem with a windows player, but it took two developers for over a year and it never got released in the end.&amp;nbsp; If two developers had been working full time on the thing we were actually selling then I think it would have been a huge win all round for the customers because all the features needed would have been done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HIGH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an iOS player.&amp;nbsp; This did get released.&amp;nbsp; Michael Dales did excellent work on one day a week to get this done in a realistic timescale.&amp;nbsp; I think technically it was a damn good idea and something to promote, unfortunately the comany itself didn't know what to do with it so it languished in marketing purgatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battling with ATi binary drivers, that was massively hard work, but I eventually had it so it could stay up for a significant period of time before the ASIC locked.&amp;nbsp; The main culprit was the XVBA decoding seemed to cause memory to eventually go mad.&amp;nbsp; The nvidia drivers had their fair share of issues like breaking vsync rendering for rotated displays which meant I ended having to make everything a surface in clutter and rotate that(!)&amp;nbsp; Adobe Flash support was similarly problematic mainly because of the underpowered CPUs we were using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HIGH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming the initial 35 batch of CODApods on my own in the shed on a Friday with Tron playing on the TV above my desk.&amp;nbsp; Tron was being played through a CODApod of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being forced to evaluate hardware from people that were basically chancing it and were realistically years away from having a fully working system.&amp;nbsp; I ended up sinking way too much time into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HIGH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who I feel embodied Camvine, Quentin, Sarah, Michael, and Thomas, without them there would have been no company to try and build.&amp;nbsp; John Naughton was also integral to the initial spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working at DisplayLink, a company set up by Quentin Stafford-Fraser, but wasn't enjoying my work, so I was looking at startups for a good challenge and found a startup founded by Quentin Stafford-Fraser...&amp;nbsp; The weird thing was I had never met him, but thought it would be an interesting challenge.&amp;nbsp; I still have no idea what made them take a chance on me, although my profile on the website called me a veteran, which definitely made me feel old.&amp;nbsp; I think one of the major factors was that I at least had an idea of how the hardware worked, you see the first product of CodaBox + CodaLinks was based on the ethernet nivos from DisplayLink.&amp;nbsp; They were an interesting proposition, very low power and low cost, but also not massively capable pieces of hardware, so one small low powered Intel Atom powered central machine could run up to 20 displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I joined Camvine mid-2008 and I ended up working in &lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/3hp4ey"&gt;"The Shed"&lt;/a&gt; which is&lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/3nt06z"&gt; a studio&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of a garden in Cambridge, where ndiyo and DisplayLink also started.&amp;nbsp; It was my first chance to do commercial Python development and it was an exciting free-flowing environment.&amp;nbsp; We even had Fun Fridays where we could work on stuff not on the roadmap, quite a few cool features came out of that single day of the week, unfortunately some did not get integrated like transitions code I had working quite sweetly on the CodaLinks.&amp;nbsp; The website was really awesome evolving into a drag and drop user interface for controlling your displays and content modelled on the iTunes style UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around that time my wife fell pregnant with our first child, you would think that startup life and children do not mix, but I went head-first into it all and it was immensely rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, we are heading towards a "The Pivot"...&amp;nbsp; The team needs introductions, we have Quentin Stafford-Fraser, CEO, ideas, maverick, like Hannibal in the A-Team.&amp;nbsp; We have Michael Dales, CTO, uber-hacker.&amp;nbsp; Thomas Hunger, developer, the brains.&amp;nbsp; Sarah McKeon, the office manager, the glue that holds the company together and keeping it running (every company needs a Sarah).&amp;nbsp; And me, lowest rung on the ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after me a sales and marketing director joined the company whose expertise was in the advertising arena, so we started to target advertisers.&amp;nbsp; Whilst CodaLinks were in interesting esoteric proposition for communicating they were not what the advertising industry craved which is tons of rich content (read: Flash) and high definition videos.&amp;nbsp; The advertising industry and digital signage are not a good place to be, but I'll come onto that.&amp;nbsp; So now we hit the pivot point around April 2009, which incidentally is the month my daughter was borrn.&amp;nbsp; We grab some Asus EeeBoxes and decide to use an Intel Atom N270 based system and start writing code for it (partially based on porting our playback code for the CodaLinks).&amp;nbsp; I start hitting the base platform with coding hammers (we were based on Ubuntu so we stauck with that) and we ended up with a Jaunty franken-distro set up mainly by me and Thomas.&amp;nbsp; By September we are shipping EeeBoxes to a potential customer needing to get rid of an unmanageable legacy system, the weird thing was I had this Acer Revo sitting on my desk and I couldn't get the damn thing to boot Linux on a USB key, then somehow I worked out how to make it work by altering the heads/sectors on the key (I'm sure I blogged about it at the time).&amp;nbsp; It had an nvidia ION as the GPU which was very interesting, for a start thhe binary drivers were much better than the Intel ones at the time (I was one of the original users of the KMS drivers trying to get it all working), also it had the ability to do video decoding on the GPU.&amp;nbsp; Because the driver quality was so good it blew the Eeeboxes out of the water with the same CPU, so this became our hardware platform in what seemed like overnight, unfortunately we did have to write off about 20 Eeebox units at the expense of the company, embarressing on my part, but totally the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales and marketing decided the new product should be called the CODApod, urgh, horrible name!&amp;nbsp; Internally I called it the incredicoda which not only sounding quite unhinged is really easy to grep for in source code, as a developer this is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advertising industry is rubbish for digital signage, they want everything perfect, which is surprisingly difficult to achieve.&amp;nbsp; You end up having to trade things on multiple axes which are robustness, speed, quality of output, and accuracy.&amp;nbsp; You can throw more staff at solving these issues but that is not an option at some startups like this running on a shoestring.&amp;nbsp; One of the things you can't explain no matter how hard you try is that displaying a web page is not a no=op, you have to download resources, start rendering, get some more resources, render some more, then you might be complete ready for display.&amp;nbsp; Even with everything cached in memory that is not a no-op.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to get the software shipped just 5 months after deciding on this was a robust software update, then things could be fixed in the field remotely.&amp;nbsp; I had made software update more robust since joining Camvine, and continually strived to make it unbreakable.&amp;nbsp; We evolved the software over the next six months into something quite impressive with hardware accelerated codecs (we paid Fluendo to finish development of VDPAU), newer, better web browsers and robust PDf viewers.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately a bombshell hit in December 2009 when Thomas Hunger decided to leave for the bright lights of London.&amp;nbsp; The months that followed were a blur, me and Michael were support and development, answering the phone and support requests as well as me developing the client hardware and him on the website.&amp;nbsp; It was simultaneously awesome and horrible, horrible volume of work, but I think we were a well oiled machine with just two people in the shed.&amp;nbsp; We stuck our headphones in and got our heads down and moved forward as well as maintaining all that was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more people joined, Quentin stepped down as CEO, and we got a new CEO.&amp;nbsp; The next bombshell for me was losing Michael as CTO.&amp;nbsp; I was profoundly gutted, not only was it amazing to work with him, I consider him a good friend.&amp;nbsp; His reasons for leaving, I will leave up to him, but losing him as CTO and protector of the Camvine faith is the worst thing to ever happen to the company.&amp;nbsp; It took me a while to realise that he should have become CEO (although obviously he would not want that job), but that would have been what was right and proper for the company.&amp;nbsp; I had a crazy idea that I should take over website development and hand CODApod development over to someone else, since I knew the most about the system and Camvien was proving to be very poor at hiring, even not allowing me to advertise on some of the places I wanted to.&amp;nbsp; Michael left October 2010, and the handover was an unmitigated disaster.&amp;nbsp; I was forced to work on attempting to make a playlist perfect for an advertising potential customer, who was never going to put their money where their mouth was.&amp;nbsp; I was doing this instead of doing a decent handover, luckily Michael was still available one day a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my head down and obsessed about the website.&amp;nbsp; Christmas was a nightmare because I was now the only thing between our website and total oblivion, especially with issues like the server going up to load 30 at 8:30am every morning.&amp;nbsp; I ended up by March 2011 restructuring pretty much all the deployment to use nginx, gunicorn, and Fabric, the tools of the modern Django coder.&amp;nbsp; The databases were split onto new machines, the load balancing worked pretty great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the CODApod was essentially dead.&amp;nbsp; The company had decided that they wanted a Windows CODA player, so this would now suck two man-years of effort into a black hole as it was never officially released.&amp;nbsp; During this time the only development on the CODApod was what I did in what i laughably called my "spare time", also the CODApod software had to be ported to work on as many hardware platforms as possible (ATi, nvidia, Intel Core) where there were no scheduled developer resources.&amp;nbsp; I was doing all this whilst also running and developing and being on-call for the website.&amp;nbsp; I felt really sorry for the customers knowing no client side developments were happening that could improve their hardware further.&amp;nbsp; Somehow I managed to have a release of CODAsoft available two months after starting work in my spare time, and I kept it up to date until the day I finished.&amp;nbsp; It worked flawlessly on Intel graphics (945 through to I think Ivy Bridge), ATI (open-source and binary drivers with hardware acceleration) and nvidia (everything the binary driver supports and with hardware acceleration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left the shed in 2011.&amp;nbsp; A very sad day for me.&amp;nbsp; The weird thing was the physical seperation matching the logical seperation of the company actually was a great thing that was not appreciated by some people.&amp;nbsp; By moving into one huge space things started to bleed into one another and there was an immense lack of self-control by certain roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment I knew I had to leave Camvine completely and utterly was Father's Day 2011.&amp;nbsp; We were out in the middle of nowhere with me, my wife, daughter and father-in-law, and there was basically no phone reception.&amp;nbsp; I got an odd phonecall and discovered the servers were down and attempted to debug what was going on through a phone call and intermittent data coverage.&amp;nbsp; Basically we were screwed.&amp;nbsp; For a bit of context, I was forced to outsource database management to someone else in order to alleviate my workload, and we ended up with two SSD based servers with master-slave, back-ups and database dumps every day.&amp;nbsp; Everything failed, but it had been failing for a month.&amp;nbsp; Hard drives?&amp;nbsp; Broken serving corrupted data silently.&amp;nbsp; Backups of the HDs?&amp;nbsp; Failing silently.&amp;nbsp; Database dumps?&amp;nbsp; Failing as well.&amp;nbsp; What happened was they decided to upgrade a backup program which caused the mysql process to restart, which is where all hell broke loose.&amp;nbsp; I managed to get in the office at 5pm Sunday and was there reconstructing enough of a business to open doors again the Monday morning otherwise we should have just shut up shop.&amp;nbsp; I have no idea how I did it, but enough was workking by 1am and Quentin was great moral support.&amp;nbsp; The next two weeks of 14 hour days involved recreating as much data as possible which was almost everything, which was something to at least be proud of.&amp;nbsp; The thought of this still makes me feel sick.&amp;nbsp; The write rate of the web service was blamed as it was doing something like 50 per second, so I rewrote portions and got it down to 0.5 per socond.&amp;nbsp; This was not the problem and it happened again but the recovery procedure was much more robust in that instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real kicker - it happened after we have a Pingdom report with one month being 100% uptime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said I wanted to leave but I was convinced to stay by being told that things will be worked out to make my workload more manageable.&amp;nbsp; Needless to say this never happened, and I got a payrise which was definitely not what I wanted.&amp;nbsp; What I wanted was Camvine to succeed and I wanted to have a healthier relationship with my work which was continually getting more and more as time went on.&amp;nbsp; I was forced out not by a specific person but the system I was working under, with four developers being wasted on professional services and the Windows player, it required way too much heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started to look, and ended up at a great start-up called Bromium.&amp;nbsp; This all took longer than I would have liked.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When I handed in my notice, I found that period was made to be immensely uncomfortable.&amp;nbsp; At least I had Italian Spider-Man to brighten the days.&amp;nbsp; I finished December 2011 with my DNA all over the place, massive amounts of website and codapod source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did I use to build the CODApod?&amp;nbsp; Ubuntu, GTK, WebkitGTK, poppler, clutter, connman, Python, and lots more.&amp;nbsp; I was really proud of the clutter Python based desktop compositor I wrote.&amp;nbsp; If people tell you Python is too slow they are wrong, 60 FPS every time.&amp;nbsp; The whole thing used process abstraction for robustness so bits could fail easily without taking the whole system down.&amp;nbsp; Everything failed gracefully.&amp;nbsp; People told me they could tell it was a Camvine system because of the smooth tickers (using OpenGL textures).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website was all Python and Django.&amp;nbsp; I'm really glad I took that on, because I discovered I love website development and I think I did a really half decent job, apart from the database disaster of 2011.&amp;nbsp; The site was dealing with 1 million requests per day and didn't break sweat on very modest hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One month after I left it was announced Camvine was going into administration.&amp;nbsp; This was a massive shock to me since I didn't know it was on the cards and thought there was 6 months money still in the bank.&amp;nbsp; Subsequently on seeing some financials the bloodletting had to happen and the company was never going to turn the corner to profitiability.&amp;nbsp; I find it annoying myself because I did not want to take out too much money from the company so made sure my wages were kept at the low-end whch most people see as idiotic, but I see as my commitment and investment in the company.&amp;nbsp; I made sure I helped people as much as I could to find more work and to help out in any way I could, after all it felt like a piece of me still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In administration it feels like people are dividing up a piece of me.&amp;nbsp; I care immensely about the product and what the company could have been capable of.&amp;nbsp; The codapod is the almost as old as my daughter and the time I have sepnt working on Camvine beyond what is contractually obligated is time I haven't spent with my daughter.&amp;nbsp; I still wouldn't trade it (apart from the horrible ending) as technically I feel I have done great work and I have grown immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pain I feel that people are trading my code without me with is huge and I look forward to not being near to it in the future because maybe the distance will let me move on.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>New Github Repo - polipo on Microsoft Visual Studio</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2012/03/02/new-github-repo-polipo-on-microsoft.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-02T21:15:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2012-03-02:blog/2012/03/02/new-github-repo-polipo-on-microsoft.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I've just uploaded a fork of &lt;a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/%7Ejch/software/polipo/"&gt;polipo&lt;/a&gt; to my Github account.&amp;nbsp; it is a caching proxy server which works really well with a tiny amount of resources. It is primarily driven by Unix development so it has a version that works on Cygwin and a version that is not considered complete or tested that can use the Mingw toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get it working with Visual Studio and I stumbled across some work &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/polipovc/"&gt;here at polipovc&lt;/a&gt; where someone got it working with Visual Studio.&amp;nbsp; It is a code dump rather than a series of patches, so I took the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jech/polipo"&gt;polipo git repository on Github&lt;/a&gt; and forked it.&amp;nbsp; I then applied the changes as a series of patches making minimal changes in each one and tried to normalise it with the project coding style.&amp;nbsp; I also created a solution for Visual Studio 2010.&amp;nbsp; It compiles for 32-bit and 64-bit (but just ignore the swatches of warnings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The on-disk cache seems to not be working properly right now so I might look a bit more closely into why that is the case.&amp;nbsp; To be honest the directory checks need to be factored out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I heard about the new version of the &lt;a href="http://www.improvelectronics.com/"&gt;Boogie Board&lt;/a&gt; which is less of a tablet, more of a paper replacement, but it would have a saving capability for pictures.&amp;nbsp; All for the price of £100 + VAT.&amp;nbsp; The Boogie Board RIP has a 9.5 inch area for drawing on and can even capture those renderings. The way the display on previous boogie boards worked was impressive in that it only consumed power to blank the display, and putting pressure on the display caused an image to be formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did wonder how on earth they would have taken that technology and been able to capture the images.&amp;nbsp; But the guys at Improv Electronics are much smarter than that, it looks like the way it works is there is a separate digitiser to the screen, so it is kind of like a graphics tablet where you can see the image you are also drawing.&amp;nbsp; You have to wake the digitiser to start using it and press the Save button to store the file.&amp;nbsp; The digitiser stores the file in a vector-based PDF leading to some quite nice images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary reason to get hold of it was for sketching and note-taking.&amp;nbsp; Also, I wanted to actually be able to use the device on Linux, and since when you connect it, it just appears as a mass storage device meaning a win there compared to other connection mechanisms (like in the Eee Note).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device itself is light and flimsy in the best possible way, making it easy to hold and also you don't worry too much about protecting the device rather than actually using it.&amp;nbsp; The battery apparently lasts for a week on a charge, but I have no idea the amount of charge my device is currently holding because it has no indicator.&amp;nbsp; This is not necessarily a problem because the device is ludicrously stripped down and simple, so I see it has having an incredibly simple UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only criticism I have about the device is more subtle than most people would notice.&amp;nbsp; Because the digitiser and display are separate devices they seem to work at different resolutions.&amp;nbsp; The digitiser is highly accurate by the look of it generating cleaner and thinner lines, but the reactive display generates thicker less accurate lines.&amp;nbsp; This may also be due to the design of the pen nib.&amp;nbsp; The pen itself is required to capture input, and I found it comfortable to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the Boogie Board Rip is a cool little device good at the job it was designed to do.&amp;nbsp; I'm still trying to work out the best way it will be my digital sketchpad but it is the device I have seen get closest to what I want (in fact if they did a really large A3 version that would be awesome).&amp;nbsp; The guys at Improv Electronics have done an excellent job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can buy them in the &lt;a href="http://gbp.improvelectronics.com/"&gt;UK from Improv Electronics&lt;/a&gt; for £120 including VAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a picture comparing the PDF output to theactual display - you can see finer lines on the image compared to the screen where some lines bleed into one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can vouch for the most important thing when dealig with media is having the latest graphics dependencies on Linux.&amp;nbsp; You tend not to have long-lived stable releases and most issues and advances are done in the day-to-day development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code is available on Github &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenELEC/OpenELEC.tv"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Going through I can see it has Python, GTK+, and Python gobject bindings, Linux 3.1rc10 kernel and lots more.&amp;nbsp; Even though it is a cut-down minimal system it doesn't lack handy things like ssh and a text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final images are a mere 100MB or there about in size.&amp;nbsp; There are scripts to create the USB install key and it even has an automated update system.&amp;nbsp; There are optimised builds for ION and AMD Fusion as well as a few other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want an XBMC computer then I can think of more heavyweight ways to get it, but if you want it to boot in 10 seconds and you don't need to cusomise it too much then this would be a really good choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me it looks like an ideal platform for trying out different media type applications (say kiosks or other media centres) with not a huge amount of code as the base system looks pretty solid.&amp;nbsp; I reckon something like Clutter's &lt;a href="http://media-explorer.github.com/"&gt;Media Explorer&lt;/a&gt; could be quite good on it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>PyCon UK 2011 - Great Conference</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2011/09/26/pycon-uk-2011-great-conference.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-09-26T20:21:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2011-09-26:blog/2011/09/26/pycon-uk-2011-great-conference.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now with EuroPython being held outside the UK, the PyCon UK takes on more significance.&amp;nbsp; Run by the same guys and now relocated to Coventry this year was a triumph.&amp;nbsp; Something like 200 people attended for the weekend log conference which is pretty impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue was excellent.&amp;nbsp; The most important aspect was all meals were supplied at the venue (and were all very tasty).&amp;nbsp; This meant that people tended not to drift off and hopefully that helped the mingling.&amp;nbsp; Some of the rooms were a little small but nobody seemed to forsee how well attended the weekend would be with lots of last minute tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic that dominated the entire conference was computing and education.&amp;nbsp; Specifically the useless nature of ICT courses and the complete lack of the next generation of coders coming through.&amp;nbsp; The obvious technology on show and being discussed was RaspberryPi.&amp;nbsp; There was also the BBC CodeLab host attempting to evoke those old feelings of the BBC Model B.&amp;nbsp; Basically the conclusion comes down to there is no will in government for changing the nature of computing in schools and it will require hackers in number making the changes piece by piece themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coding Dojo was a lot of fun using the task of Maze Generation.&amp;nbsp; We managed to lash enough together five minutes form the end and I think we surprised ourselves by it working.&amp;nbsp; Also the web development open forum was good, maybe I spoke too much in that....&amp;nbsp; and I managed to get a demo of &lt;a href="http://camvine.com/"&gt;Camvine&lt;/a&gt; in there.&amp;nbsp; There was also three thought-provoking and entertaining keynotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always the people there made the conference.&amp;nbsp; The team who ran it all did a sterling job, even better than their previous EuroPythons.&amp;nbsp; Team 4 in the Code Dojo did a great bit of work, Matt, Safe, Adrian, and Menno.&amp;nbsp; I also got to speak to the keynote speaker Allison Randal at the meal, in fact the whole table was entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my recommendation, even if you don't use Python much, is to go to PyCon UK next year because I am pretty sure you will learn something or meet some really interesting people.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Raspberry Pi - The Trojan Horse?</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2011/08/28/raspberry-pi-trojan-horse.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-08-28T19:42:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2011-08-28:blog/2011/08/28/raspberry-pi-trojan-horse.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/"&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; project has got a lot of coverage today thanks to the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/aug/28/ict-changes-needed-national-curriculum"&gt;article in the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href="http://memex.naughtons.org/"&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental problem has never been the lack of cheap hardware.  Even in this day and age it is not the lack of quality freely available tools.&amp;nbsp; A kid who has the propensity to be a hacker nowadays would invariably have Linux installed with the myriad of tools available, and also doing that they would have the knowledge it should work fairly easy on other computers running roughly the same operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is attempting to invoke the feeling of the BBC Micro in an attempt to get kids programming again, because in the near future we are going to be in a very precarious situation with our engineering ability in this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all why did the BBC Micro succeed? It is very hard to compare to today with the abundance of computing hardware just in your pocket.&amp;nbsp; Part of it was almost every classroom across the land had one of these and the children who could work out how to operate them hunted 1s and 0s in packs.&amp;nbsp; There was a communal aspect to it as the children would have to share, listen, and take it in turns.&amp;nbsp; Also, there was the TV programme &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Live"&gt;Micro Live&lt;/a&gt;, which was needed to get a chunk of publicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first programming was done on BBC Micros at school in the East End of London and at friends houses as we couldn't afford one at home. So, I for one know their importance and probably a majority of my friends and colleagues had similar start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was at University Linux was just starting to gain some traction and the work of the FSF got us GCC and the mix of other tools.&amp;nbsp; But on Windows I was still trying to use DJGPP and there was no chance of getting more complex things working with an open (free and Free) toolchain.&amp;nbsp; Children coming up in that age must consider it the computing Dark Ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I come back to my first statement that cheap hardware has never been the problem.&amp;nbsp; The people getting excited about it are 30+ developers like me who think - "Oooooh, cheap commodity ARM platform, that I can hack in lots of ways".&amp;nbsp; My immediate thought was to make it into an immensely cheap network connected digital signage system.&amp;nbsp; And this is probably because ARM is still a minefield and a static and well supported platform would be desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not trying to negate the good work done by Raspberry Pi as it could be amazing if it is the Trojan Horse.&amp;nbsp; What do I mean by that?&amp;nbsp; The hardware becomes the makeweight for all the real important stuff that needs to happen if we are truly going to educate the next generation of programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is needed?&amp;nbsp; Community, publicity, documentation and traction.&amp;nbsp; Community because this goes beyond the single classroom of my youth.&amp;nbsp; You need IRC, social networking and tools for more permanent sharing (like &lt;a href="http://github.com/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/"&gt;Gist&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; This then ties into documentation, it would need to be good up front but also allow for the people to evolve it, so much like a wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just social media publicity would not be enough, you would really need a TV programme to generate it, but then this is where the social media would tie in.&amp;nbsp; For the programme they would have to show the users best contributions so there is an incentive to produce and produce something good.&amp;nbsp; After all how many people sent a picture into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartbeat"&gt;Hartbeat&lt;/a&gt; in the hope of getting into the gallery? It's the closest computing could get to the X-Factor...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part will always be changing the educational system to get children learning how computers to make computers work for them rather than simply going through the commercial Word Processor/Spreadsheet operating.&amp;nbsp; I suppose this is where the documentation does come in, but I think there will need to be more.&amp;nbsp; If someone could show educators a curriculum that they could prove worked then that might get the traction required.&amp;nbsp; That would be a tough proposition and also I am unsure about whether there are enough technical skills in the educational sector to deploy such a thing.&amp;nbsp; Maybe it would require people from industry coming in and mentoring... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I am hoping that the Raspberry Pi hardware is the Trojan Horse for something much more fundamental.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Linux at 20</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2011/08/26/linux-at-20.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-08-26T07:32:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2011-08-26:blog/2011/08/26/linux-at-20.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If it didn't exist I somehow think computing would be a much less fun place and I probably wouldn't be able to do my job so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;mint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My MacBook Pro developed the &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2377"&gt;nVidia graphics failure problem&lt;/a&gt; and I got the motherboard replaced, it has never been the same since and when I asked I basically had no warranty for it. So after three-and-a-half years I decided to buy myself a new laptop. Lacking the riches required for another Apple I decided to go where I am really most comfortable &amp;#8211; Linux. So after a lot of research and fingers crossing I picked up an &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/UL20A-A1-Light-12-1-Inch-Silver-Laptop/dp/B002PAQXAE"&gt;Asus UL20A&lt;/a&gt; off of eBay for 318 quid including postage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specs are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core2Duo SU7300 (dual core 1.3GHz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12 inch display at 1366&amp;#215;768&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quoting something like 8 hours battery life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4GB RAM (upgraded by me for 25 quid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60GB solid state drive (upgraded by me for 95 quid) &amp;#8211; an OCZ Vertex 2E with the respected Sandisk controller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of this post, however, is not to review a piece of hardware, but to get Linux working flawlessly on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux Mint 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use&lt;a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/"&gt; Linux Mint 10&lt;/a&gt; (Ubuntu base), this is instead of stock Ubuntu which I find very cluttered on initial install and also requires me to do loads of fiddling to get a normal looking and clean desktop environment.  Linux Mint 10 is based on the latest Ubuntu but presents the user a very nicely set up session after the first install.  The desktop is uncluttered, there is only one panel at the bottom, and theme is head and shoulders above the Ubuntu default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux Mint does have a Debian based edition which I will switch to later but the packages are a lot further behind the latest Ubuntu and since I was going to use some more modern features for the SSD I would have to have done a lot more hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I partitioned the SSD the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;256MB ext2 /boot partition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4.1GB /swap partition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15GB btrfs / partition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40GB btrfs /home partition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use btrfs because it is the latest and greatest available file system for Linux.  This means it has things like TRIM support for SSDs and can do cool stuff like snapshots, but this also requires a newer kernel for better support hence not using the Linux Mint Debian Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ext2 boot partition is required as you can&amp;#8217;t boot directly from btrfs according to the information I found out there.  The swap partition is memory + 100MB for supporting hibernate.  The main partition is separate from the home partition &amp;#8211; &lt;strong&gt;this is very important when you use Ubuntu&lt;/strong&gt;.  Because Ubuntu does releases every six months you can attempt upgrades, but I have seen and experienced this failing with catastrophic consequences.  Luckily having a separate home partition means you can tell Ubuntu to reinstall to the main partition but just mount and use you home directory without formatting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installation took me about 10-15 minutes before I was there in my freshly installed desktop.  Now, almost everything works straight out of the box, it is case of tweaking to get some of the more hidden features working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Finger Scrolling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two finger scrolling on the Synaptics touchpad requires a little bit of tweaking.   Create a file called /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-twofingerscroll.conf with the folling contents:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Section "InputClass"&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Identifier "touchpad catchall"&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then start up&lt;em&gt; gconf-editor&lt;/em&gt; and change&lt;em&gt; /desktop/gnome/peripherals/touchpad/scroll_method&lt;/em&gt; to the value &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have two finger scrolling working and also two finger right click!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The LCD Brightness Keys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires a small change to your boot settings so that you can use the function keys to set the screen brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit &lt;em&gt;/etc/default/grub&lt;/em&gt; so that the line with &lt;em&gt;GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX = &amp;#8220;&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; says:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="acpi_backlight=vendor"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;em&gt;sudo update-grub &lt;/em&gt;and reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Settings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help improve battery life install powertop by using &lt;em&gt;sudo apt-get install powertop&lt;/em&gt; then run &lt;em&gt;sudo powertop&lt;/em&gt; and follow its instructions.  You should be able to help squeeze precious minutes out of your battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did attempt installing the latest kernel along with the latest graphics drivers.  This was mainly for graphical hacking and trying out newer btrfs options.  This is a big mistake.  For a start the battery monitoring stops working although I managed to solve that, then shutdown stopped working consistently.  So for all the benefits don&amp;#8217;t bother if you prefer your system to be properly functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Did Next&amp;#8230;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always use &lt;a href="http://ubuntu-tweak.com/"&gt;Ubuntu Tweak&lt;/a&gt; and it works on Linux Mint 10.  This allows you to get some more interesting packages and also update to cutting edge versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something I don&amp;#8217;t like about Google Chrome despite its super-speed, so I always go back to Firefox.  Unfortunately distros currently use 3.6 but I have been using 4.0 for about six months, it is much quicker, better looking and more robust.  Through Ubuntu Tweak enable the Minefield repositories and get it.  Also install the Nightly Tools Addon to help get your Addons all working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I install ttf-droid fonts normally and switch all my desktop to use that as it gives more space, but for people who don&amp;#8217;t like small fonts you probably should avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also installed and am running the theme from the &lt;a href="http://www.elementary-project.com/"&gt;elementary project&lt;/a&gt; which gives a less Minty user interface for Linux Mint.  It&amp;#8217;s purely aesthetical, although the elementary Nautilus file browser is much better than the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All In All&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of it I have a fully working Linux laptop that boots in less than 20 seconds and shuts down in about a second.  It is easy to use and responsive which makes me really happy.  From what I have been trying to work out the ASUS laptops seem to have fairly decent Linux support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up I am going to have to get hacking on &lt;a href="http://www.libimobiledevice.org/"&gt;libimobiledevice&lt;/a&gt; because I have an iPhone and I would like to avoid running updates via a virtual machine or something.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Python is beautifully over-engineered</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/08/12/python-is-beautifully-over-engineered.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-08-12T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-08-12:blog/2010/08/12/python-is-beautifully-over-engineered.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I could have called this &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t re-invent the wheel&amp;#8221;. Sometimes the Python standard library really surprises me because some bits are very over-engineered, but in a really good way. First time I realised this was when I was working on what became &lt;a href="http://github.com/garrybodsworth/coda_network"&gt;coda_network&lt;/a&gt; as most people solving the proxy problem and other downloading issues just write a new network library, but there are some really handy base classes to derive from to solve it. Admittedly it did require some bug fixing along the way, but it was kind of worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In coda_network I&amp;#8217;ve got a mini proxy using ForkingMixin to do a process per download bypassing a lot of GIL based multithreading pain. I needed some more multi processing support for some shared state and possibly locking. So I started trying to do a MultiprocessingMixIn for the SocketServer/TCPServer/BaseHTTPServer. I thought &amp;#8220;this is easy just rip off the threading one since they share the same interface&amp;#8221;. That worked really well for general use but when I started putting the system under severe load the process cleanup started going wonky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I think I got it working using this code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang="PYTHON" line="1" file="MultiProcessingMixin.py" colla="+"&gt;class MultiprocessingMixIn:
    """Mix-in class to handle each request in a new process."""

    # Decides how process will act upon termination of the
    # main process
    daemon_processes = False

    def process_request_process(self, request, client_address):
        """
        Same as in BaseServer but as a thread.
        In addition, exception handling is done here.
        """
        try:
            # Actually do the request
            self.finish_request(request, client_address)
        except:
            # XXX: will this work with multiprocessing correctly?
            self.handle_error(request, client_address)
        finally:
            # Close the socket request
            self.close_request(request)

    def process_request(self, request, client_address):
        """Start a new thread to process the request."""
        t = multiprocessing.Process(target = self.process_request_process,
                             args=(request, client_address))
        if self.daemon_processes:
            t.daemon = True
        t.start()
        # Now we close the parent request socket because the child process
        # is now responsible for it
        self.close_request(request)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important bit is closing the request in the parent after the child process has started since it takes responsibility for it then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang="PYTHON" line="1" colla="+"&gt;class ProxyServer(MultiprocessingMixIn, BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer):
    pass

proxy = ProxyServer(address, HttpResponder)
proxy.serve_forever()
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve probably missed a couple of bits (like making sure the handle_error does what is expected) but this is at least a good starting point&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>A coda_network update</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/08/03/a-coda_network-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-08-03T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-08-03:blog/2010/08/03/a-coda_network-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been making a slow trickle of commits to &lt;a href="http://github.com/garrybodsworth/coda_network"&gt;coda_network&lt;/a&gt; as I need various features. The httplib.py and urllib2.py have been used in the field for a while in a variety of networks and I am pleased with how it has gone (now that means I need to get these changes upstream when I have a chance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what changes have gone in?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt; A skeletal mock proxy server that can fake HTTP and HTTPS requests. This will perform the basis of unit testing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; Fix a bit where TCP keepalive failed to happen over HTTPS.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt; Implemented MD5-sess digest authentication which seems to be what IIS Windows servers use.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; Added an authentication handler for OAuth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authentication handler for OAuth was the most work. Essentially I had to extract the OAuth logic from &lt;a href="http://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2"&gt;oauth2&lt;/a&gt; and remove all the close coupling with httplib. This then means you can have an OAuth handler in the urllib2 world of Python and do it through proxies and the suchlike. Your server does need to return a 401 rather than the ones I have seen that get a 500 internal server error when the request is made without authorisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get it working I cheated and reused username and password because they have little meaning in the OAuth world. So you end up with something like this (you can skip the token part if you don&amp;#8217;t have it yet):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
    password_mgr = urllib2.HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm()&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
    password_mgr.add_password(None,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
                              'http://oauthprotected.com',&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
                              KeySecret('consumer_key', 'consumer_secret'),&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
                              KeySecret('token', 'token_secret'),&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
                              )&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
    auth_handler = oauth_auth.HTTPOauthAuthHandler(password_mgr)&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is all done entirely in HTTP headers and there is no option for GET or POST parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>How (not to) write notes at Europython 2010</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/08/02/how-not-to-write-notes-at-europython-2010.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-08-02T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-08-02:blog/2010/08/02/how-not-to-write-notes-at-europython-2010.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was told my write-up of Europython was useless without seeing the actual pictures I was drawing when I should have been writing more notes&amp;#8230;. I wasn&amp;#8217;t necessarily bored, just bitten by the drawing bug once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up I started with a simple Optimus Prime to pass the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garrybodsworth/4854492950/" title="Europython notes page 1 by Garry Bodsworth, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4854492950_8742ed17cc.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="Europython notes page 1" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Optimus Prime needed someone to fight, so Megatron popped in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garrybodsworth/4854526694/" title="Europython notes page 2 by Garry Bodsworth, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4854526694_3eb8316d50.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="Europython notes page 2" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Megatron was upgraded into the insane killing machine of Galvatron.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garrybodsworth/4853912621/" title="Europython notes page 3 by Garry Bodsworth, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4853912621_87b798271d.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="Europython notes page 3" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot Rod (for some reason channelling David Bowie) is needed to keep Galvatron in check.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garrybodsworth/4853917113/" title="Europython notes page 4 by Garry Bodsworth, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4853917113_983454eb10.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="Europython notes page 4" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tough looking Iron Man decided to get in on the act.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we go back to a slightly better rendered Optimus Prime.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Death&amp;#8217;s Head slightly sketchy, yes?&lt;br /&gt;

It was four days of talks, food and beer. Before I completely forget everything I thought I&amp;#8217;d write up my experience. This is the last year in Birmingham and next year it heads to Florence but PyCon UK will carrying on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did not only end up sketching such luminaries as Optimus Prime, Megatron, Robocop, Death&amp;#8217;s Head (1 and 2), and Judge Dredd, I actually took some notes as well(!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This write up has taken me a few weeks since my iPhone4 died completely then my Macbook Pro decided to contract the nvidia graphics chip of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russel Winder &amp;#8211; The Multicore Revolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The everything you&amp;#8217;ve held true all this time is going to change speech. Russel was thoroughly entertaining as usual especially with the sidetrack into physics. He stepped in at the last minute for someone dropping out going to OSCON or something, but if they hadn&amp;#8217;t said noone would have known or complained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Idiomatic%20Python"&gt;Idiomatic Python/Python Tips and Tricks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was the talk of the conference (there was a second part later I unfortunately missed because it overran). Basically everyone in the audience no matter how expert they were in Python will have learnt something. It rattled through at great pace. Stuff I learnt included:&lt;br /&gt;
Copying a sequence c = s[:]&lt;br /&gt;
Delete a sequence s[:] = [] or del s[:]&lt;br /&gt;
Iterating an array using enumerate() means you get a pair of index, value&lt;br /&gt;
Iterating multiple sequences with zip() means you keep the arrays in lockstep&lt;br /&gt;
You can do a for -&amp;gt; else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/The%20Development%20Process%20Of%20Python"&gt;Python Development Process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I simply had to go to this because now I am thinking about the process to merge my changes I have made in &lt;a href="http://github.com/garrybodsworth/coda_network"&gt;coda_network&lt;/a&gt; back upstream since they seem to be working quite nicely now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The branches are:&lt;br /&gt;
3.2 &amp;#8211; branches/py3k&lt;br /&gt;
3.1 &amp;#8211; release31-maint&lt;br /&gt;
2.7 &amp;#8211; release27-maint&lt;br /&gt;
2.6 &amp;#8211; release26-maint&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do an update and compile of the source do ./configure &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make&lt;br /&gt;
Or you can do a debug version by ./configure &amp;#8211;with-pydebug &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make&lt;br /&gt;
And you only need make if the C files have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing tests is extremely important, so write them check they fail, fix the problem and re-run the tests to make them work! You should run your tests with Lib/Test/regrtest.py&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run all tests do ./python -m test.regrtest -uall and to do a specific test replace uall with the test name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently there is a maintainers file under Misc/maintainers.rst which should be very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/How%20Import%20Works"&gt;How Import Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I went to this because it can never hurt to know what is going on int he background. It covered some of the new functionality including relative imports which you can get at on older versions by doing &amp;#8220;from __future__ import absolute_import&amp;#8221; then you can do funky stuff like &amp;#8220;from ..spam import flying_circus&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the process of doing import:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolve the name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the module, it is possible to create custom finders that can drag your package from anywhere like the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then do a loader.load_module(fullname) and you&amp;#8217;ve got it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are putting in a __pycache__ where all the .pyc files go so you can use multiple interpreters without conflicting .pyc files and also they don&amp;#8217;t get left around on your hard drive because they are all in one place. It helps prevent having stale .pyc files that can be accidentally imported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross Platform SIG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was an impromptu talk because there were quite a few drop-outs for talks. I decided to go because I feel Windows stalking me at every turn and I can only run away for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part was reimplementing UNIX commands in Python for some self contained non-administrator helpful commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also mentioned was &lt;a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; for generated Python documentation and &lt;a href="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew"&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; for Mac OSX to get a slightly better dev environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Testing%20Http%20Apps%20With%20Python3"&gt;Monstrum &amp;#8211; Python HTTP testing in Python 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Seems to be testing by using HTTP headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Porting%20To%20Python%203"&gt;Porting Python 2 to 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One thing I wrote on my notepad was &amp;#8220;Hiding to nothing&amp;#8221;. I seem to remember thinking it requires a lot of effort and the ideal solution could conceivably be the most work which is a codebase that works in 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Muddle%20Inventing%20A%20Build%20System"&gt;MUDDLE &amp;#8211; A Build System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Muddle is a build system for building embedded systems written in Python. Considering my day job I could not miss out on this one since it is very relevant. It supports lots of VCS, and build systems (make, linux kernel, apt-get, initscript, version files, debian files). Basically, I need to find the time to really experiment with this and attempt to build a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Kbus%20A%20Simple%20Messaging%20System"&gt;KBUS &amp;#8211; A simple messaging system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a messaging system using a Linux kernel module. It is modelled on a socket model which is really easy to wrap your head around. The testing is all done in Python which makes it really powerful to use. It is definitely worth considering over dbus as that is really incredibly painful. I know some uses for this already myself after the pain of dbus and dbus-python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Standards &amp;#8211; Democratising The Web&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Bruce Lawson from Opera had the keynote about open standards on the web. He gave this &lt;a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2006/pas-78-guide-to-good-practice-in-commissioning-accessible-websites/"&gt;interesting link&lt;/a&gt; about accessibility. He also mentioned the media queries for CSS to layout your content from different resolution screens and physically shaped devices. Also he mentioned &lt;a href="http://www.html5patch.org/"&gt;html5patch&lt;/a&gt; for cross browser html5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/A%20Case%20For%20Accessibility"&gt;A Case For Accessibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a subject close to my heart so there was no way I was going to miss this. They designed &lt;a href="http://getmediacore.com/"&gt;Mediacore&lt;/a&gt; with accessibility in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The W3C says 10% population in most countries has a disability and the average age of the population is increasing such that the rate will get higher. They found actually seeing people with disabilities attempting to use the web through screenreaders and the suchlike made them see how hostile the web is (I am looking at you Tescos after your redesign, but that is a whole other article).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things you should be thinking about are:&lt;br /&gt;
Order of menu items and in fact number of menu items.&lt;br /&gt;
Alt text for images &amp;#8211; people still don&amp;#8217;t do this!&lt;br /&gt;
Form labels&lt;br /&gt;
Tab order&lt;br /&gt;
Headlines and paragraphs are semantic and help&lt;br /&gt;
Hiding things right. display:none does not necessarily work with screen readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some accessibility guidelines are available &lt;a href="http://northtemple.com/1608"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And something even closer to my heart, reduce or eliminate Adobe Flash completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also easy to partner with a visual disability centre, like for instance the RNIB or Sense. There is also some Non Visual Accessibility web certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Html5%20The%20Good%20The%20Bad%20And%20The%20Quite%20Interesting"&gt;HTML5: the good, the bad and the quite interesting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And this talk was really quite interesting. Just talking about the new things that are getting added to the HTML standard (the title is really honestly for marketing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve got new things like a header element that can go anywhere, and a nav element to contain say a group of links. You can tag something article which is a discrete piece of content. There is now a time element to unambiguously mark something as a time and date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly (although Opera is the only browser implementing it right now) is form validation so you can have HTML smart forms which flag up to the user when something needs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Round Of Lightning Talks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There was the face tracking robot called Hedroid that delighted the audience. We had a talk about how the mobile interface for the schedule was knocked up in a pub and deployed in about an hour. There was the pyweek game development challenge. The online pygame book. And a few more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Python%20And%20Windows%20Equality"&gt;Python On Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Just to see how Python is getting on in the world of Windows and what real world stuff people are doing with it. CPython from the standard installer seems to work well for most people and there are a few useful packages like active_directory, wmi, and pywin32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Python%20In%20The%20Browser"&gt;Python In The Browser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is web programming using Silverlight + ironPython. It&amp;#8217;s an interesting thing to see and looks like it could make Windows development more palatable. There is a really good demo &lt;a href="http://www.trypython.org/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the Python tutorial code executed in the browser. The useful addresses are gestalt.ironpython.net/dlr_runtime.js to get python in the browser using Gestalt and silverlight.codeplex.com for the Silverlight Toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I say I see Windows stalking me in dark alleys&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Of Python&lt;br /&gt;
Another day, another keynote. Interesting bits from the talk included &lt;a href="http://badassjs.com/post/745778955/skulpt-python-implementation-in-javascript"&gt;Skulpt&lt;/a&gt; which is an implementation of Python in Javascript. Also there was &lt;a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/berp-0.0.1"&gt;Berp&lt;/a&gt; which is Python 3 in Haskell that compiles down to Haskell. Also a mention was made of &lt;a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute"&gt;distribute and pip&lt;/a&gt; which should help with the minefield of deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Organise%20A%20Python%20Code%20Dojo"&gt;Organise a Python Dojo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An entertaining talk about how the London Coding Dojos started with a strict &lt;a href="http://codingdojo.org/"&gt;adherence to the rules&lt;/a&gt; and how they evolved into what they are now. They have things like multi-week projects divided into small units (like a text adventure game). I think what I really took away is start with the default arrangement then find what works with the type of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Adapting%20Libraries%20To%20Twisted"&gt;Twistify Your Library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Deferred%20Gratification"&gt;Deferred Gratification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I think I sat in these because I lacked the ability to stand up and it was nice and air conditioned. What I really learnt is Twisted deserves its name and it is implemented in completely the wrong language. My sketch involved Judge Dredd declaring &amp;#8220;Guilty! The sentence is death!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/The%20Guardian%20Api%201%20Year%20On"&gt;The Guardian API One Year On&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was about the kind of things the Guardian API is now capable of and how it is the antithesis of the newly implemented Murdoch Paywall. The first example was an online version of the paper which can be viewed &lt;a href="http://guardian.gyford.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and there was the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/zeitgeist"&gt;zeitgeist example&lt;/a&gt;. Basically there are &lt;a href="http://guardian.mashery.com/"&gt;three levels&lt;/a&gt;, keyless for simple access, approved to get at the actual data, and bespoke for full access with no ads. They have also opened up a large variety of data in the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog"&gt;Guardian Datablog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Gevent%20Network%20Library"&gt;gevent library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a library for large multithreaded programs. It is a lot more sensible than Twisted and fits into the Python semantics a lot better. It still needs a lot of work for various other python features like subprocesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Lightning Talks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I did a talk about &lt;a href="http://github.com/garrybodsworth/coda_network"&gt;coda_network&lt;/a&gt; and fixing up httplib and urllib2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a quick one about &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/__main__"&gt;__main__.py&lt;/a&gt; which was really interesting because you can do all kinds of packaging like adding all the files to a ZIP and making it work. Creating a __main__.py means you can execute a Python library which is really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a talk that mentioned all kinds of hackery you can do with the with statement. One library is &lt;a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/withhacks"&gt;withhacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a really cool demo of pdb++ a new funky python debugger. I think the repository is &lt;a href="http://github.com/antocuni/pdbpp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve skipped some bits of Europython because I simply had Python overload and I am sure important stuff got pushed out of my brain.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Virtual On-Screen Keyboards On Linux</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/07/11/virtual-on-screen-keyboards-on-linux.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-07-11T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-07-11:blog/2010/07/11/virtual-on-screen-keyboards-on-linux.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;With a &lt;a href="http://thejoojoo.com"&gt;tablet&lt;/a&gt; awaiting a better operating system I decided I had to evaluate the landscape on on-screen virtual keyboards on Linux. Obviously the ideal would be iPad/iPhone-esque, but that would be really frighteningly good, I had much lower expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not sure if the tech was there to even show the keyboards automatically when an input field was selected. GTK are well ahead of the game on this with their IMContext base class to encapsulate input mainly for complex languages or disability accessibility, but a good side-effect is the ability to hook in an on-screen keyboard when a text input is focused. In that case the on-screen keyboard needs to know about GTK in order to know when to show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested all these on a VM that has now run out of hard disk space thanks to having to compile lots of stuff. Most of the keyboards I completely failed to make automatically appear on the screen when a text input was selected, it was either me or them&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in no particular order&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://matchbox-project.org/?p=1"&gt;Matchbox Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some people are using this actively. It requires hacking to be able to toggle the display of it which makes it pretty much a no-go as it would always be on top of the screen. The GUI looks all right though. Some good info &lt;a href="http://japiblog.dddgames.com/?p=15"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/tsato/xvkbd/"&gt;xvkbd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The venerable old man of the line up. It&amp;#8217;s been around the block and does exactly what it says on the tin. It has lots of good features and hacks (like making it appear for login windows). As far as I could see I couldn&amp;#8217;t hook it up to the IMContext but I could be missing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gok.ca/"&gt;Gnome On-Screen Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The oldest GTK based one and seems to be showing its age thanks to the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Accessibility/Projects/onBoard"&gt;onboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the Ubuntu one. I couldn&amp;#8217;t get it to automatically appear on focus. It looks OK, but seems to be lacking some features. At least it is easily hackable in Python. Some more interesting information &lt;a href="http://www.combibo.net/articles/using_an_onscreen_keyboard_in_ubuntu/"&gt;is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://florence.sourceforge.net/english.html"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the most recommended one and it is pretty good. The main pain was I had to compile it as their were no packages for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gitorious.org/fvkbd"&gt;fvkbd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This looks fairly promising as it is very skinnable on configurable. Unfortunately I could not work out how to hide or autohide the keyboard. Also this had no packages and requires compiling. This provides the basis for the OLPC virtual keyboard test and also the Meego/Maemo virtual keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://live.gnome.org/Caribou"&gt;Caribou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the virtual keyboard testbed for Gnome 3.0. It is written in Python and needs packaging so I had to compile it. This was the one that got closest to what I want because it worked. It shows a small keyboard by the input with current focus. In my VM I had to disable the Clutter code for whizzy animations before getting it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve probably missed some but there are only so many not quite ready applications you can test before going completely and utterly bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I discovered was Google Chromium&amp;#8217;s addressbar is accessibility implemented, but none of the content in webpages is. Firefox on the other hand and anything WebkitGTK based (like Epiphany) all work properly with their accessibility. Part of the Chrome problem is the multiprocess rendering and that they have not prioritised accessibility according the bug reports I have read.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>JooJoo Technical Details</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/07/10/joojoo-technical-details.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-07-10T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-07-10:blog/2010/07/10/joojoo-technical-details.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those of you as nerdy as me I thought I would try a virtual teardown of the JooJoo to gather information on its internals.&lt;/p&gt;

A Review</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/07/09/joojoo-or-is-that-iooioo-a-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-07-09T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-07-09:blog/2010/07/09/joojoo-or-is-that-iooioo-a-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I finally managed to get myself a &lt;a href="http://thejoojoo.com/"&gt;Fusion Garage JooJoo&lt;/a&gt; from eBay for a reasonable price. I had previously tried to order through their online shop with multiple failures, basically their payment system does not work (I tried with three different cards). This was not a great start to my experience, so I sat it out and waited for one of them to appear on eBay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was I so keen to get hold of one? It is essentially an nVidia ION in a tablet. At &lt;a href="http://www.camvine.com"&gt;Camvine&lt;/a&gt; the main hardware is based on this platform, so I thought it would be a great toy to play with and get our software working on it. I can say my gut feeling was right and I had it going quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No pictures for this one as they are all over the Internet. But check out great internal photos &lt;a href="http://thejoojooforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;amp;t=316"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on to the review&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HARDWARE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ll start with the hardware. It&amp;#8217;s not badly done, with a nice sturdy engineered body. The quality of finish does surpass what I thought it might be. What we have is nVidia ION netbook internals crammed into a slim tablet chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Display&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The screen size is just wrong, I know why they went for 16:9 (with a very respectable 1360&amp;#215;768 720p resolution) but it just doesn&amp;#8217;t work. When you are in portrait the top of the screen is way too far away from you. The screen is really configured for movies rather than web browsing with that shape and resolution. Ideally for a tablet you do want something closer to 4:3 and each edge being a minimum 1024 (I&amp;#8217;ll come onto why in the software section). The viewing angle on the screen is good in one direction but then the other it is literally useless and you end up tilting it to see the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The tablet does get very hot. It has a fan internally which you can hear quite clearly when you hold it up to your ear. That is good, but the thing that gets really hot on the ION is the video chipset (I&amp;#8217;ve seen it going at 70ºC). The heat seems to be at its greatest somewhere around the battery pack area which is odd since it is the other side to the processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Button&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Either my fingers are too big or the power button is just not very good. It is quite good as it is orange when charging and white light when on, but it is recessed too far and seems terribly unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambient light sensor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Great to have one, but unfortunately it is positioned more or less where you place your left hand when you are operating in landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is a bit more weighty than it needs to be but I put that down to the screen size. With a smaller, better screen it would have been much more of an impulse device to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The logo on the case appears when the JooJoo is switched on which is a real nice touch. Also it illuminates the right one depending on the orientation you are currently in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Webcam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It has a webcam but I have not seen that it works &amp;#8211; maybe it is for future software releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I simultaneously dislike and like the hardware (from an external point of view). For the internals &lt;a href="http://mjg59.livejournal.com/124426.html"&gt;some corners have been cut&lt;/a&gt;. The niggles take away from the final finish, so with things like ambient sensor positioning, power button, and screen physical dimensions fixed it would be a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOFTWARE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For all of the hardware it is the software that will make or break the platform. The software is basically a web browser with a web based start page showing bookmarks, with compiz to switch between windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boot Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is fairly quick to boot, but now lots of things boot quickly. It mainly suspends when you &amp;#8220;power off&amp;#8221; and then restart. This is great for speed but unfortunately the software can get upset so you need to reset hard in order to get a working system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Menu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The main menu at the top I still haven&amp;#8217;t quite worked out how you are supposed to bring it up. Sometimes it is a tap at the top and sometimes a one finger swipe near the top. Sometimes it is the top left only as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wifi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It seems it can only remember the last wifi network you were connected to so you have to type in the password again and again when you change locations. For a portable internet connected device that is pretty poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrolling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The JooJoo is &amp;#8220;multitouch&amp;#8221; for differing values of multitouch. Essentially the only thing I have found multitouch is that webpages scroll by using two fingers (like the Apple touchpad). There is no other functionality I have found like rotate or pinch n zoom. The really annoying thing is that the main webpage that you start from uses one finger to scroll (due to the HTML implementation I am guessing) so once you are used to two-finger scrolling going back to the main page is really painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Browser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
According to some &lt;a href="http://thejoojooforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;amp;t=217"&gt;hackery on the JooJoo forum&lt;/a&gt; the browser is actually Google Chrome. It is surprising it has some performance deficiencies in scrolling and browsing. The browser supports Flash as well which may please some people (my intense aversion to it does not endear me to it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multitasking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Because all webpages you have open are essentially live, you can end up with a Flash video playing int he background sapping CPU without even realising because it does not suspend the background processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compiz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can switch the active web browser window using a compiz based switcher. It hasn&amp;#8217;t been nicely user tested as you can end up scrolling off the left or right and struggling to get an active window. To throw away a page simply chuck it off the top which is a nice gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotation and Orientation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rotation is obviously done using xrandr. This means no nice animation when changing orientation and you get the horrible destruction/creation of the framebuffer. Also the orientation seems to only have only two active edges because otherwise the illuminated logos would be upside down. This makes it inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GTK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It obviously has some GTK in the background (for Chrome), but I have seen GTK error dialog pop up momentarily whilst whizzing around the compiz 3D bit. It looked very odd. Also in the Chrome browser it is obvious there is no GTK theme because you have the default (and off-putting) grey standard widgets for combos and the suchlike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Webpages and Scaling and Zooming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As I mentioned earlier there is no pinch and zoom and no way to scale webpages. This is really important because of the resolution of the device. One direction it is 768 pixels, so most webpages are designed with a minimum 1024 width and this means that you have to scroll horizontally to see a whole webpage. There are two solutions &amp;#8211; either scale a webpage (which is really easy in WebKit &amp;#8211; even I have managed it for &lt;a href="http://camvine.com/products/coda"&gt;CODA&lt;/a&gt;), or supply a screen with a minimum 1024 in both directions (1280&amp;#215;1024 is still a great resolution).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Okay, I log into all of these webpages and then switch off the device. Someone else switches it on and they can just go straight into those webpages because it simply remembers the credentials. This is a wide gaping security hole and brings me onto the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is a single user device. I am pretty sure there is no particular &amp;#8220;user&amp;#8221; on this linux system, this means it is right pain for more than one person to check their gmail on this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The software is OK for a toy, but not to be used beyond an internal engineering practice. I was pretty annoyed by it after five minutes, so it is time to nuke it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HACKY HACKETY HACK HACK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So the real reason I got it was to hack my own OS onto it and to play around writing apps for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a stand I decided to order a plate display stand which should work a treat and you can get two for a fiver(!) Also I have ordered a 2Gb PC3-8500 204 pin DIMM for £25 to up the memory. This should make it even nicer to hack on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SSD storage is the biggest debacle though, it is a mini-PCIe mSATA with some flipped pins which makes it impossible to find a replacement. People have been trying for while now. However, what I have ordered is a SD card to mini-PCIe adapter so I should be able to shoe-horn in some storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wifi is also horrific, it is a Realtek card and as anyone who has tried to get these working on Linux solidly can attest they are cheap and nasty. I can&amp;#8217;t get it to work even when compiling the module under a 2.6.31 kernel. I might find another half height mini-PCIe wireless card to replace it with, Atheros has been quite good (and maybe find a wireless N).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best bit is the screen and touchscreen is mounted upside down so all firmware images and media are stored upside down. Pointless attempt to avert hacking&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IS IT THE END YET?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So the JooJoo is good and bad, I couldn&amp;#8217;t recommend it to &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; users, but it is a real interesting hacking platform. If some of the tablet OSes come out this year they could give it a whole new lease of life. Hardware wise it is nearly there, but needs more work (and battery life). The software is a long way from being first useful, and then good which is unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>coda_network – and update already(!)</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/06/21/coda_network-and-update-already.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-06-21T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-06-21:blog/2010/06/21/coda_network-and-update-already.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After releasing the first version of &lt;a href="http://github.com/garrybodsworth/coda_network"&gt;coda_network&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend I have found a few bugfixes (corner cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainly these involved using an NTLM proxy and attempting to tunnel a socket through it. This makes sense of the proxy case where you are trying to daisy-chain sockets together. This was really an issue with keep-alive proxies where the Request object was not resetting some cached state that would only ever work once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main feature now though is I have added mini_proxy.py. A multiprocess proxy server using all my code changes. Only GET, POST and CONNECT are implemented, but that should be sufficient for most tests. This mini proxy can then speak to upstream proxies of no authentication types, as well as basic. digest, and NTLM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The readme on the &lt;a href="http://github.com/garrybodsworth/coda_network"&gt;github page&lt;/a&gt; has been updated with example commandlines for the proxy and I have tested it against all kinds of proxies. Because of all the other work put into httplib and urllib2 the proxy itself is actually only 200 lines. I&amp;#8217;ve got no idea how efficient it is, but it should work fine.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Fixing urllib2 and httplib Python networking – coda_network</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/06/19/fixing-urllib2-and-httplib-python-networking-coda_network.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-06-19T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-06-19:blog/2010/06/19/fixing-urllib2-and-httplib-python-networking-coda_network.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can get &lt;strong&gt;coda_network&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://github.com/garrybodsworth/coda_network"&gt;from GitHub here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally the networking code at &lt;a href="http://www.camvine.com"&gt;Camvine&lt;/a&gt; was based on httplib a very long time ago, then Curl was used (pycurl specifically with changes pushed upstream), but now I have been using normal Python 2.6 standard library functions which is much nicer. The default one distributed was not sufficient so I had to make some fixes through deriving classes and monkeypatching. That is a very basic history of the coda_network package&amp;#8217;s origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve based these changes on the Python 2.6 maintenance branch so it should in theory work with all versions of 2.6 Python (and I suppose possibly the 2.7 release). I did maintain my changes as patched derived classes, but I decided to integrate the changes into urllib2 and httplib directly in an attempt to eventually get these changes or something similar to them upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.camvine.com"&gt;Camvine&lt;/a&gt; have allowed me to publish the source code for all of these fixes so I am putting them on github with my often strange commit comments. I&amp;#8217;ll get on to the functionality and fixes that I provide in a moment. This all stemmed from attempting to fix tunnelling HTTPS through proxies and then having to fix it for NTLM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the repository there are the new httplib/urllib2 files which can be dropped in. They have been made part of a coda_network package along with a few other helper files.  Below is the readme in the &lt;a href="http://github.com/garrybodsworth/coda_network"&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;
    The Files
  &lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;urllib2.py&lt;/strong&gt; Based off &lt;a href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/release26-maint/Lib/urllib2.py?view=markup"&gt;http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/release26-maint/Lib/urllib2.py?view=markup&lt;/a&gt; revision 81637 The only public API change is that Request now has an optional &amp;#8220;method&amp;#8221; parameter.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;httplib.py&lt;/strong&gt; Based off &lt;a href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/release26-maint/Lib/httplib.py?view=markup"&gt;http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/release26-maint/Lib/httplib.py?view=markup&lt;/a&gt; revision 81688 The only public API change is that the HTTPResponse object has a tunnel True/False parameter so we know if the response is from a normal request or a tunnelling request.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;utilities.py&lt;/strong&gt; Some simple wrappers I use to expose the functionality. This also provides a really basic do_download functions to do downloading with minimum of fuss. This stuff is a bit specific to me.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;connect.py&lt;/strong&gt; This is to allow connecting to a vanilla socket whilst reusing all the proxy auto code (rather than the rather painful process of not being able to reuse it).
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;ntlm_auth.py&lt;/strong&gt; This provides the proxy and HTTP authentication handlers.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;ntlm subdirectory&lt;/strong&gt; This is a copy of a portion of the code from python-ntlm &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-ntlm/"&gt;http://code.google.com/p/python-ntlm/&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Fixes and features provided
  &lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      The request object now provides a method. This is handy for doing requests like OPTIONS which are necessary for cross-domain javascript or proper HEAD requests.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Allow digest proxy authentication to work by retrieving the correct location and the correct password because these were previously designed only for HTTP auto. Also for digest auto of proxies it requires the CONNECT information to generate the digest correctly.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Remove the cyclic dependency in constructing the response passed to the higher levels thanks to a member function being assigned to a member variable. This is done in the simplest way possible by wrapper the receiver in a simple class adapter, it could have been done by using weakmethods, but it works.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Tunnelling HTTPS through proxies is fixed.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Added the optional socket_keepalive in order to do deliberately long-lived connections (for long-poll). This is available for HTTP and HTTPS.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      A very important part with CONNECT errors was to make sure it is exposed at the right time. This then allows for proxies and other things that require retrying to work. Previously a socket error was thrown immediately, whereas now it is exposed through the getresponse() function which allows the call stack to make the right judgements on the error code.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Allow the specification of a certificate for HTTPS connections such that secure connections to remote servers can be made.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Rather than using simple socket sends when doing tunnelling it now uses the standard HTTPConnection putrequest(), putheader() and endheaders().
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Improve some of the messaging in the error handling so we can reason about some of the errors.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Add the ability for connections to be kept alive with Keep-Alive when the connection/proxy connection specifies it. I noticed digest is really not happy with this.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Add NTLM authentication using the python-ntlm files for generating the hashes which in turn is from NTLMAPS as far as I can see. This works for both proxies and www-authenticate. The connection Keep-Alive is really important for NTLM as the Windows servers require the socket connection to be kept open continually.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;
    What coda_network can do
  &lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Use the following proxy types &amp;#8211; normal, basic authentication, digest authentication, NTLM authentication.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Authenticate websites &amp;#8211; basic authentication, digest authentication, NTLM authentication.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Request types &amp;#8211; any you can think of.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Known limitations
  &lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Digest authentication of a website when going through a proxy seems broken. This is probably due to the source of the request in generating the hash. It is such corner case that I am not looking into it right now.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;
    FAQ
  &lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;What versions of Python are supported?&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/dt&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;
    It was written and tested on a Linux system with 2.6.4. It has worked with a couple of different revisions of 2.6. In theory looking at the code for 2.7 it should also work with that.
  &lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Any plans to port to Python 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, etc?&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/dt&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;
    Nope. I don&amp;#8217;t have a need for it right now, but I think it should be possible to port these fixes when the time comes.
  &lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what am I planning to do next for coda_network? To be honest it is functionally complete from my requirements but there are some less glamorous things that need doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish writing up the unit test suite for proxies, downloads and requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add some more example scripts for downloading and the suchlike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add an example mini_proxy that is half written right now that provides a Python based local proxy that can connect to any of the supported parent proxies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix any bugs I find and from any feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to egage the Python community to get these fixes or something similar pushed upstream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And when I feel really brave &amp;#8211; go have a look at Python 3.&lt;/li&gt;

My router, my iPhone and my MacBook have all been playing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My MacBook has been booting really slow (I&amp;#8217;m talking 20 to 40 minutes) and the graphics and general operation have been going downhill. I thought I would take a Windows inspired fix after trying everything else I could think of (blaming the processor, hard drive, graphics chip), and reinstall the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This failed numerous times. Something as simple as an install? Great. Eventually getting the install log shows this type of message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unable to set as boot disk: the bless tool was unable to set the current boot disk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is on a completely clean install of Snow Leopard. The installer was also unable to unmount which inturn means repair the disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow I stumbled on &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379"&gt;this fix on the Apple Support Site&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently you have to reset your parameter random access memory (PRAM) and nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM). This involves the incantation Command-Option-P-R keys and restarting. Now the install took first time, this has been a public service announcement.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Long-Lived Processes</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/06/01/long-lived-processes.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-06-01T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-06-01:blog/2010/06/01/long-lived-processes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things about developing a &lt;a href="http://www.camvine.com/"&gt;digital signage system&lt;/a&gt; is that the software running the display has to run for a long period of time. From what I have heard some people set their digital signage players (from other companies) to reboot every night which is an odd state of affairs, whereas we just say plug it in and switch it on. That does not mean we are infallible and I am constantly hunting down strange behaviours in the long-lived process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have really found from the reality of having real operating systems out there in the big wide world is that you will always encounter that which you cannot predict. There is however a way to mitigate the risk. You need to take a leaf out of the server world. Your main process should be as simple as possible doing the absolute minimum, then spawn processes to do the donkey work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of this is that if anything does go wrong in the real hard work then when the process is closed or is aggressively killed the resources are returned back to the system. In Linux this is particularly good because it is really good at starting processes efficiently. I saw evidence of this when git was spawning lots of perl processes, which in Windows was a lot slower, meaning that git in Linux on a VM in Windows was much faster than on plain Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Python has a built-in multiprocessing library (which was really put in place to get around the GIL issues) but it gives a great framework for managing processes and inter-process-communication. This is available from 2.6 up and I must get around to porting more stuff to it rather than rolling my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great feature of the Linux graphics stack is texture from pixmap so that you can have out-of-process rendering and composite it all together in OpenGL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really the lesson I learnt by forgetting to not put something into a separate process is that the unimaginable will happen, from bizarre corruptions, to parsers that should fail but are just too robust, which then means you have memory hanging around forever.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Twitter Weekly Updates for 2010-05-30</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/05/30/twitter-weekly-updates-for-2010-05-30.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-30T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-05-30:blog/2010/05/30/twitter-weekly-updates-for-2010-05-30.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul class="aktt_tweet_digest"&gt;

    So running a large (&gt;500Mb) installer with UAC enabled on Windows causes a huuuuuge delay. Nice. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/garrybodsworth/statuses/14748547398" class="aktt_tweet_time"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;

    Got 1000 pages of Doctor Who comics to read. Should be good as it's the 8th Doctor stuff before the whiff of success. All for under £20. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/garrybodsworth/statuses/14852662298" class="aktt_tweet_time"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;

    Windows 7 is hatefully bad. I even had to spend time making it more Vista-like which in turn recurses to more XP like. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/garrybodsworth/statuses/14990774715" class="aktt_tweet_time"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Google have announced the &lt;a href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/05/introducing-google-font-api-google-font.html"&gt;Google Web Font API and the Google Web Font Directory&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;What with Google pushing 3D web, video, geolocation, fonts, app store, online collaboration (opening up Wave to all), and god knows what else I think they are heading towards completely closing the loop functionality-wise.

As part of this they are creating the &lt;a href="http://www.webmproject.org/"&gt;WebM&lt;/a&gt; project with a new container format that uses the open-source &lt;a href="http://www.vorbis.com/"&gt;Vorbis&lt;/a&gt; audio codec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who has to deal with video codecs every day and the horrors they induce (not just from a technical standpoint but legal) this is a very good thing. Unfortunately it does have some way to go to depose the incumbent codecs, and to reach parity with respect to hardware acceleration, but I am sure it will happen swifter than we can imagine. The main reasons for this is that Youtube will be using it which is a large portion of the web&amp;#8217;s video, and th enames that are all on board to support it in both software and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can tell you as soon as gstreamer gets support &lt;a href="http://www.camvine.com"&gt;CODA&lt;/a&gt; will be getting WebM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also now a technical analysis from an x264 developer which can be read &lt;a href="http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=377"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>iPad Accessibility</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/05/16/ipad-accessibility.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-16T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-05-16:blog/2010/05/16/ipad-accessibility.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I took the company iPad on a weekend holiday to my parent&amp;#8217;s house. My ulterior motive was to find out whether it really was accessible, and by that I mean for people with audio and visual impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother is registered as deafblind (contrary to what spell checkers will tell you it is all one word), this does not mean she is completely devoid of sight but it she has an extremely limited field of vision (for the specifics it is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usher_syndrome"&gt;Usher Type 2&lt;/a&gt; Retinitis Pigmentosa). Currently she uses a standard Windows PC with minimal changes from the default settings. There is also a big monitor, which is actually more of a detriment to someone who cannot see all of the monitor at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first plus for her was the form factor. Most people moan it&amp;#8217;s too small or it isn&amp;#8217;t widescreen, but this was an item that could be viewed as a whole even taking into account a limited field of vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people say touchscreens don&amp;#8217;t work because of the lack of tactile feedback which some have said is required for blind people. This depends on your definition of blind, a person completely devoid of sight is actually a rare occurrence, most people who are registered blind have some degree of sight left and know how to make the most of it. She was able to type with ease on the keyboard. The limitations of the keyboard however though were the inability to set the contrast settings for it independently of the rest of the system (white on black is normally the choice for people with visual impairment). Also it would have been good if important items were highlighted in some way like &amp;#8220;Go&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Search&amp;#8221; because otherwise you end up searching on the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important aspects of a touchscreen is that it is not necessary for the cursor to be large, and also with visual impairment time is spent trying to find the cursor on the screen which is difficult with a large surface area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of the screen and its contrast was extremely good for someone with visual impairments. Clarity of viewing and also the viewing angles are extremely important in that respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I haven&amp;#8217;t even got to the specific accessibility features available on the iPad which frankly knocks any competing product for six. You have the ability to view white on black, but this does a complete inversion meaning it looks like you are looking at a negative, but it&amp;#8217;s better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text-to-speech features are excellent with the quality of playback being listenable rather than annoying. You can use this on the ebooks, websites, the user interface. It does mean navigation is slightly more complex but being patient helps because the speech also gives you hints as to the action to perform next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have the ability to switch the sound to mono, which will have every techie screaming, but it is very important for any auditory problems because then you get the same sound into both ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to zoom in on pages is taken for granted by most phone users nowadays but this is another invaluable feature, and the ability to configure text size in iBooks is also as valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the screen size would be great if only iPlayer worked on it yet (I realise we have a pre-ash cloud import so the official UK release is a little while away) with subtitles. In fact the content delivery would be extremely important, and I hope that providers will supply subtitles for their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the accessibility features it got me thinking that when it gets even more integrated you are talking about turn-by-turn navigation and general independence help thanks to location based APIs. A map would be a nightmare for someone with a narrow field of vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important aspect of all of this is that it is so well thought out and intuitive to use. It all clearly integrates with the system and creates a simple to use environment. The quality of the engineered components is second to none matching the quality of the software that will no doubt improve with subsequent revisions. As a developer I dread lock-in but there are simply no alternatives that are within five years of being close to competing, it does revolutionise computing for a swathe of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I saw how much the iPad was going to be in the UK I thought it was too rich for my blood and I would put off buying one for myself. But now I see how much it will be liberating for people with sensory impairment when configured correctly I have to put my thinking cap on again.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Twitter Weekly Updates for 2010-05-16</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/05/16/twitter-weekly-updates-for-2010-05-16.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-16T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-05-16:blog/2010/05/16/twitter-weekly-updates-for-2010-05-16.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul class="aktt_tweet_digest"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are VA-API backends (in the project &lt;a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libva/"&gt;libva&lt;/a&gt;) for Intel chips, VDPAU for nvidia (and allegedly S3) chips and XvBA for AMD chips (have they ever officially released it?) So this acceleration framework will work on tons of hardware out there. Except for the Intel open-source drivers you do need to use the binary closed source drivers (also for Intel Poulsbo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.splitted-desktop.com/~gbeauchesne/gstreamer-vaapi/"&gt;gstreamer-vaapi&lt;/a&gt; plugin supplies MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, VC-1, WMV3 acceleration (providing your hardware supports it). Also output is on OpenGL rendering through VA/GLX or GLX texture-from-pixmap + FBO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being gstreamer it should be relatively swift for many applications to pick up the acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Twitter Weekly Updates for 2010-05-09</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/05/09/twitter-weekly-updates-for-2010-05-09.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-09T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-05-09:blog/2010/05/09/twitter-weekly-updates-for-2010-05-09.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul class="aktt_tweet_digest"&gt;

This is a set of indie games that are up for sale at any price you want to pay with your choice as to how much goes to charity and how much goes to the developers. It looks like they have raised a lot of money for good causes (indie game developers deserve it was well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the games work on Windows, Mac and Linux (woohoo!) They are all DRM free and you can install them and run them how you want. The games are &lt;a href="http://2dboy.com/games.php"&gt;World Of Goo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.crypticsea.com/gish/"&gt;Gish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria/"&gt;Aquaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.wolfire.com/lugaru"&gt;Lugaru&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.penumbragame.com/ageGate.php"&gt;Penumbra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to go and install them on the wife&amp;#8217;s Linux netbook &amp;#8211; after all you always need more games on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>WebKit keeps me spinning round</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/05/05/webkit-keeps-me-spinning-round.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-05T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-05-05:blog/2010/05/05/webkit-keeps-me-spinning-round.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So after all the issues I was having with WebKitGTK having undebuggable crashes somewhere in the nvidia binary blob I decided to have a go at QtWebKit integration. It was fairly quick and easy to do (I cheated and used &lt;a href="http://www.pyside.org/"&gt;PySide&lt;/a&gt; for brevity). That was good &amp;#8211; no crashes, some nice looking fonts, Flash working and generally all was good, so I started to think how to do a proper integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where it all goes wrong. I find with most things an initial test implementation is quick and gives you a feel for the problem, when you actually have to do the real thing you discover all kinds of creepy crawlies hiding under rocks. QtWebKit has now split out from Qt, but there is no packaging for this new branch that I could find under Ubuntu, not too much of an issue since I am used to packaging stuff up. I found HTML5 playback with the gstreamer Phonon backend simply did not work in any half decent fasion and they were concentrating on QtMultimedia which unfortunately is part of the development release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal breaker was the speed of CSS animations, which I am lucky I actually got around to checking since I was juggling so many variables. It was unfeasibly slow. So I decided to use the new QtWebKit 2.0 as it contains compositing acceleration support for just this problem. Indeed, using raster or opengl graphics backends did speed up the animation to very smooth. What I then discovered was I could have smooth animations and no working Flash or rough animations and a kind of working Flash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all most depressing, so I have gone back to WebkitGTK. It is only this crash issue I have to get to the bottom of but it only shows itself in one of my tests which is very specific, and I am thinking it is related to the way xlib is working in the nvidia driver. I do prefer GTK to Qt, so that is also good for me! I would have given EFL Webkit a go, but unfortunately they seem to have removed features in getting the functionality into the Webkit trunk.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Twitter Weekly Updates for 2010-05-02</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/05/02/twitter-weekly-updates-for-2010-05-02.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-02T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-05-02:blog/2010/05/02/twitter-weekly-updates-for-2010-05-02.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul class="aktt_tweet_digest"&gt;

So I thought I&amp;#8217;d share some of the things I picked up about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously the Apple implementation is the cream of the crop for speed an features. In fact the Mac OSX version isn&amp;#8217;t top of the tree, it&amp;#8217;s the &lt;a href="http://www.satine.org/archives/2008/11/06/coverflow-for-safari-on-iphone/"&gt;iPhone/iPad version&lt;/a&gt; that has been furthest ahead. It got the accelerated compositing of web elements first and could do all kinds of funky 3D transforms using OpenGL. The OS X version got those features only in the &lt;a href="http://www.satine.org/archives/2009/07/11/snow-stack-is-here/"&gt;middle of last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other ports vary in stability, features and usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.webkitgtk.org/"&gt;WebkitGTK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the port of WebKit to the GTK+ widget set. It has been through a lot of changes like where the network backend moved to a new library which meant that proxies could not work for a fair while. The rendering itself uses Cairo (good stuff), but it is just a shame you can&amp;#8217;t easily switch backend (like swapping from xlib to opengl). It uses Pango for font rendering which I know is very good, but it has a serious limitation, it can&amp;#8217;t load temporary fonts directly from a file, this means that the new font-face features in HTML will be a long way off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/QtWebKit"&gt;QtWebKit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The rendering quality does look seriously good, but as usual with Qt I am finding very bad performance metrics. I&amp;#8217;ve tried changing rendering backends where &amp;#8220;native&amp;#8221; seems to perform best and &amp;#8220;opengl&amp;#8221; fails then segfaults (which is even more surprising when you consider I am using the nvidia binary drivers on Linux which are pretty full featured).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML5support seems a bit flaky at best with one of my sample set completely freezing the process. On the plus side there is integration work already done for compositing, and fonts look seriously good. I got Flash working and it seems OK, but not quite as fast as WebkitGTK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest advantage though is &lt;a href="http://www.pyside.org/"&gt;PySide&lt;/a&gt; which are comprehensive generated Python bindings for Qt. It allowed me to a do a very quick integration with the gobject mainloop in Python as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have also broken away from the protracted Qt release process which allow them to release WebKit features much faster. This makes life a lot easier and they are allowing targetting of more than one version (although not officially supported).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/EFLWebKit"&gt;EFL Webkit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have a soft spot for EFL and &lt;a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/"&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;, it gets a lot of the basics very right (small reusable components and fast and low footprint). EFL Webkit shares a majority of infrastructure with GTK including the Cairo rendering and network backend. The project has also recently picked up sponsorship from Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a really cool demo of the web browser being drawn on a 3D surface using the EFL libraries. You can see it &lt;a href="http://blog.gustavobarbieri.com.br/2009/11/04/evas-uv-mapping-and-webkit-efl/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s got gstreamer integration for HTML5 video and plugin support for Flash (oh well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that just covers those main ones available on Linux. There is still the &lt;a href="http://opensource.palm.com/1.4.1.1/index.html"&gt;Palm WebOS&lt;/a&gt; version, Blackberry, &lt;a href="http://www.sand-labs.org/owb"&gt;OWB&lt;/a&gt;, and tons more. OWB looks the simplest for enabling porting to new platforms and I have built the SDL version in the past. Then there is the Windows version of WebKit and the standalone Mac build&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Binary blobs…</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/04/28/binary-blobs.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-04-28T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-04-28:blog/2010/04/28/binary-blobs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I discovered a way to consistently crash xorg using the nvidia driver.  Open webkitgtk, close it, wait fiver seconds, open it again, rinse and repeat for 15 minutes.  Boom xorg explodes.  Go look at the logs and you have a stack trace telling you something went wrong. As far as I can tell it is running out of texture memory. Bizarrely it doesn&amp;#8217;t do this for videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nvidia driver itself is really quite good in the grand scheme of things providing things like tear-less, hardware accelerated video. It&amp;#8217;s still more consistent and better quality than the open-source ones (obviously owning all the IP and information helps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is the problem with binary blobs you can&amp;#8217;t tell what is going on inside until the state is spat out in the event of failure. I generated the bug report using the nvidia supplied tool and looked at it myself, and there was no information in there that would give a clue as to why. If the internals were exposed you could look at where the memory was going like in the days of &lt;a href="http://blog.programmerslog.com/?p=367"&gt;GEM memory leaks on Intel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess open-source has its own set of advantages and limitations, as well as the closed-source approach, but damn, I hate losing many hours trying to at first reproduce then diagnose it, let alone being able to make an attempt to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Start Me Up</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2010/04/25/start-me-up.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-04-25T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2010-04-25:blog/2010/04/25/start-me-up.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This may turn out to be one of those hollow promises again, but I am going to get this blog up and running again even if it kills me.

&lt;p&gt;What I need to do now though is try and get some Python changes merged upstream. I have been beating the networking code in urllib2 and httplib (two completely separate yet hopelessly intertwined) modules actually working. This means fixing HTTPS, digest proxy authentication, in fact proxy authentication, and tons more subtle interactions (like passing on CONNECT requests).&lt;/p&gt;

I think the order will need to be 1) write lots of tests 2) get a number of small patches 3) cross reference it all with the python bug tracker. And this is all only in 2.6.4 currently.&lt;/p&gt;

After all &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-big-screen-tvs19-2009nov19,0,4027697.story"&gt;California has enshrined in law&lt;/a&gt; restrictions on the power usage of televisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working for a &lt;a href="http://www.camvine.com"&gt;digital signage company&lt;/a&gt; I have to deal with a lot of displays. The initial hardware platform only had VGA output, great, power saving worked using DPMS. The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_Display_Power_Management_Signaling"&gt;VESA Display Power Management Signaling&lt;/a&gt; standard version 1.0 was released in 1993, even since moving from CRTs to the flat screen world we live in nowadays (making some of hsync and vsync options surplus to requirements on new flat screens, but it simply maps to &amp;#8220;off&amp;#8221;). The monitors people used behaved themselves. The next platform we used briefly had DVI and VGA output and monitors that supported those inputs all adhered to the teenage standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is where problems now creep in. DVI can be plugged into an HDMI port very easily. The current hardware platform has native HDMI so it is fairly obvious to suggest that customers use this rather than the VGA output that is also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I stepped through the looking glass. Apparently because HDMI and DVI are electrically equivalent then there is nothing to stop the manufacturer having DPMS support. I was developing thinking that HDMI would be great for users since they would also get audio transport built into the single cable. I kind of assumed DPMS was still working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to find a single display that does respect DPMS. Of course most people want to use cheap consumer televisions so they don&amp;#8217;t stand a chance of this support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most worrying thing I have found about those cheap consumer displays is that they do supply VGA ports that don&amp;#8217;t even support DPMS. A lot of these displays also have a &amp;#8220;feature&amp;#8221; to power off after a ten minute (or so) period of inactivity and the only way to power it on is to physically press the power button or the remote, it doesn&amp;#8217;t even notice when a signal starts again(!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two possible solutions. One is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#CEC"&gt;HDMI-CEC&lt;/a&gt;, which is Consumer Electronic Control. One or two of the pins (depending on the HDMI version) is essentially a serial port, and this provides the standard for communication on this. This would be good but you need extra chips built into your HDMI output which only one computer has (a Toshiba laptop &amp;#8211; and it only works on Windows&amp;#8230;). Also the even larger problem is that every manufacturer seems to have their own standard, RegzaLink, SIMPLink, VIERAlink, BRAVIAsync, and a myriad of others. If you buy all your equipment from the same manufacturer you will end up with some benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other solution at least in the digital signage use is to use the RS232 service port for controlling the display. Each monitor tends to have its own way of doing it and can even vary between model numbers. Also it has been heard from the manufacturers that they will be phasing this out and most new TVs don&amp;#8217;t even have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary? Display power saving used to work for most people, now it doesn&amp;#8217;t. So, it is all well and good reducing the power consumption of the devices but there is a way of removing a lot of power from the equation by switching off the panel when it isn&amp;#8217;t being used. This was a solved problem that has been unsolved by engineering madness. Because some TVs are unable to wake from their power saving state over any connection I ended up having to add a &amp;#8220;power saving&amp;#8221; option that doesn&amp;#8217;t actually save any power&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Europython Blogging</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/06/30/europython-blogging.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-06-30T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-06-30:blog/2009/06/30/europython-blogging.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;And here I am at Europython 2009 in rainy but inhumanly hot Birmingham.

This lead to to what I consider an insane discovery, USB flash drives have heads, cylinders, and sectors/tracks, but they are entirely virtual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What your normally end up with is a prompt saying &amp;#8220;Boot Error&amp;#8221; and nothing else of use. This is because some BIOS are limited to 1024 cylinders so you need to change the geometry of the flash drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do this in Linux with the following commandline (where sdX is the device which is the usb flash storage):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang="Bash" colla="+"&gt;mkdiskimage -4 /dev/sdX 0 63 62
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers depend on the size of the USB key as they need to be chosen to get a total number of cylinders less than 1024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1GB stick would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang="Bash" colla="+"&gt;mkdiskimage -4 /dev/sdX 0 64 32
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 1GB-2GB stick would be:&lt;/p&gt;

You also need to update your kernel for more features like better kernel memory management, kernel mode switching, and other basic things. The driver can work (for differing levels of working) for older kernels, but the bugfixes tend to be on the latest version. I have tried this on an Intel 945GM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is how you update your kernel for Jaunty (and other Ubuntus would probably work). A really handy repository of kernels is maintained by Ubuntu called &lt;a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/"&gt;Mainline PPA&lt;/a&gt; where you can download pretty much any version of the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for kernel 2.6.30 you need to download the following file : &lt;a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.30/linux-image-2.6.30-020630-generic_2.6.30-020630_i386.deb"&gt;linux-image-2.6.30-020630-generic_2.6.30-020630_i386.deb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You need to install this by calling:&lt;pre colla="+" lang=”Bash”&gt; sudo dpkg -i linux-image-2.6.30-020630-generic_2.6.30-020630_i386.deb &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the install it should have run update-grub. If not run &lt;strong&gt;sudo update-grub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get kernel modesetting working as well as fixing a couple of minor issues you need to edit the file &lt;strong&gt;/boot/grub/menu.lst&lt;/strong&gt; for some extra parameters. You need to edit the line that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre colla="+" lang="Bash"&gt;kernel      /vmlinuz-2.6.30-020630-generic root=/dev/sda7 ro 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And add the following between &amp;#8220;generic&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;root&amp;#8221;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre colla="+" lang="Bash"&gt;nopat enable_mtrr_cleanup i915.modeset=1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two sort out some hardware bugs on the Intel 945 depending on the hardware platform which can vary. Acer Aspire Ones don&amp;#8217;t necessarily have the same mtrr bugs as MSI Winds and so on. The modeset parameter switches on kernel modesetting which you will hopefully not notice many changes with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find kernel modesetting played a lot better running X without any monitor connected and dealt with a lot of odd mode issues.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Clutter 0.9.4 Released</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/06/20/clutter-094-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-06-20T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-06-20:blog/2009/06/20/clutter-094-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A new developer snapshot version of &lt;a href="http://www.clutter-project.org"&gt;Clutter&lt;/a&gt; has been released which is part of the journey towards Clutter 1.0. The project is an OpenGL renderer for user interfaces which uses the gobject base system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I post this though is that I have contributed (terribly minor) patches to this release. Plus also as part of the progress to 1.0 there are some very substantial changes under the hood. There is now a master clock for rendering which should improve rendering quality and smoothness. Also, beware, all units have been removed and it uses floating point values in the API now. There is some cool debugging features in the OpenGL wrapper part of Clutter so performance work can be done more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

Since it is on the more or less bleeding edge of development there can be some issues, but personally I tend to see more issues with outdated drivers than running the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There reason that this process is so simple on Ubuntu is that some nice and clever people have packaged it all up on &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers"&gt;xorg-edgers&lt;/a&gt;. The instructions here are for Ubuntu Jaunty 9.04.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some commandline incantations to make and some text files to edit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a file &lt;strong&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list.d/xorg-edgers.list&lt;/strong&gt; that contains the following text:&lt;pre lang=”Bash”&gt; deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/xorg-edgers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/xorg-edgers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now execute the following commands:&lt;pre lang=”Bash” line=”1″ file=”update.sh” colla=”+”&gt; sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 0x165d673674a995b3e64bf0cf4f191a5a8844c542 sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you should have pulled in the latest Intel drivers and related dependencies. You might have also updated other packages on your system if you are not fully up to date with your software &amp;#8211; don&amp;#8217;t worry this should be fine. If you reboot now your system should use these latest drivers with some spiffing UXA acceleration&amp;#8230;. but that is not all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some stability issues if you are using a 945 based card, so you need some minor configuration changes. Run the following commandline:&lt;pre lang=”Bash”&gt; dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you need to edit your &lt;strong&gt;/etc/X11/xorg.conf&lt;/strong&gt; and edit the device section so it looks a bit like this:&lt;pre lang=”Bash” file="part-xorg.conf"&gt; Section "Device" Identifier "Configured Video Device" Driver "intel" Option "Tiling" "false" Option "FramebufferCompression" "False" EndSection &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part is to get those two lines containing &amp;#8220;Option&amp;#8221; which fixes the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using stock Jaunty then you will not have Kernel Mode Setting which provides better mode detection and switching for Linux. This requires a new kernel, but I will blog about that tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The Platform Is The Hard Part</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/06/18/the-platform-is-the-hard-part.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-06-18T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-06-18:blog/2009/06/18/the-platform-is-the-hard-part.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu is essentially a layer of abstraction on Debian providing additional stability and usability (niceties I would probably call them) in order to make a public release. Even with this additional layer of checking and development work it is targeted at a specific market and platform. It should work on all computers in a manner of speaking, and it is almost impossible to check all hardware combinations, let alone software packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you use this already abstracted layer as the basis for an even more specific &amp;#8220;distribution&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;. When you can limit your hardware targets, you then have to make sure the software is really performant and solid on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the problems become smaller in the grand scheme of things, progress fixing them takes longer, seeming to almost grind to a halt. It also depends on the software you use which uncover bugs in seemingly unrelated libraries, drivers and processes. I&amp;#8217;ve been encountering a lot of these, but this is the wonder of open-source. Solving all of these problems was possible with enough graft because all of the elements were available. This means identifying and communicating with the right communities, and then if you have any fixes getting your changes upstream into their repositories. The problem is though you still have to maintain your own patches because of the trickle down between distributions can take a very long time, and good changes rarely make it into already released software because of the big-bang big-release mentatility. As I have played more I find myself wishing for a rolling release distro&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once you have your shiny platform all in place &amp;#8211; how do you keep it up to date. You always find in the pursuit of getting it functioning you have to update manually&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>EFL Webkit 0.1 Released</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/06/17/efl-webkit-01-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-06-17T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-06-17:blog/2009/06/17/efl-webkit-01-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first version of &lt;a href="http://www.webkit.org"&gt;Webkit&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.enlightenment.org"&gt;EFL&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href="http://tonikitoo.blogspot.com/2009/06/webkitefl-01-released.html"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;What this does is allows you to watch live and time-shifted television as well as schedule recordings. MythTV is a bit of a pain to set up but once the backend is fully configured then you shouldn&amp;#8217;t need to touch it. The best part for me was the web interface for scheduling recordings because it can show much more information than a TV interface would normally allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of the XBMC frontend is much better than the default one that comes with MythTV (which I found counter-intuitive and lacking). The UI for mythbox integrates perfectly and formats everything professionally. The &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/mythbox/wiki/Screenshots"&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt; are pretty representative of what you get. There have been a few more beta releases since the one I used but even for pre-release software I found it good enough to use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used this combination for a while, and the only thing lacking for me was the hardware. Otherwise the experience was extremely good.

I submitted the &lt;a href="http://bugzilla.openedhand.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1640"&gt;patches&lt;/a&gt; last week, and they got pushed onto master in time for Clutter 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with Clutter a bit more now and it is well inside the GTK+ comfort zone. I am really pleased I can contribute something useful to a project of this size because I am so used to using libraries but not actually fixing them. It&amp;#8217;s the glory of open-source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around a little with Clutter 1.0 and its master clock based animation and it looks really interesting. Just be careful that some parameters are floats instead of ints now and this caused me to segfault.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Intel 945GM Linux Drivers – The Good Bits</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/06/13/intel-945gm-linux-drivers-the-good-bits.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-06-13T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-06-13:blog/2009/06/13/intel-945gm-linux-drivers-the-good-bits.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Using the latest Linux drivers for Intel 945GM are really, really good. The best drivers available for Linux displays in my humble opinion, especially since the deficiencies are more hardware related rather than the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the UXA acceleration you can even composite x-video windows in OpenGL. The 3D performance is impressive for such an old device and as of the end of last week xvmc was working as well with GEM. It uses the latest tech available in Linux display drivers like Kernel Mode Setting and DRI2 (which is a new interface for speaking to the kernel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest drivers are also not only well capable of good compositing, but they are also capable of it without tearing, even with x-video surfaces. The actual rendering itself doesn&amp;#8217;t tear any more thanks to people like &lt;a href="http://virtuousgeek.org/blog/index.php/jbarnes"&gt;Jesse Barnes&lt;/a&gt; who have put great effort into that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since computers like netbooks/nettops are coming with the 945GM chipset, good support for it is essential. This is even better when it is open-source because you can help out with hackery and diagnosis (actually editing the code is very scary, but I tried a bit attempting to backport some changes to 2.7 because master was not stable enough at the time). It was a bit frustrating trying to balance performance, features and stability when deciding which driver version to finally run with, but I can see the driver is almost there with some minor stability work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I must say the guys have done really good work and 2.8 looks like it will be a really good release performance/feature-wise. I think I have wedged the hardware a few times, but I suppose the 2.7.99 releases are alpha, and also it is probably down to me hammering the graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Intel 945GM Linux Drivers – UXA and Memory Leaks</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/06/13/intel-945gm-linux-drivers-uxa-and-memory-leaks.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-06-13T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-06-13:blog/2009/06/13/intel-945gm-linux-drivers-uxa-and-memory-leaks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things I have been plugging away with at work is getting Intel 945GM graphics drivers working at their best. I was using 2.6 and 2.7 with the new UXA acceleration because it works really well with composite and xvideo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was there was a memory leak that you could drive a bus through. Because the Linux driver stack is so complex (Mesa, X Driver, X-server, kernel gubbins, the Direct Rendering Manager library) it was proving extremely difficult to find where the memory was going because it was still being used even when the process was closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the code I was writing I found I could get the memory of the computer fully utilised in less than one hundred iterations. Luckily that meant I could write a &lt;a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2009-May/002559.html"&gt;small test case&lt;/a&gt;. The bug hit particularly hard in Moblin which relied on the Intel drivers and Clutter. At least five bugs in Freedesktop Bugzilla seem to report it, plenty in Launchpad, and several in Moblin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out Shuang He of Intel diagnosed the root of the problem in the Mesa driver where pixmaps weren&amp;#8217;t being released properly and has submitted &lt;a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2009-June/002791.html"&gt;some patches&lt;/a&gt; for that. The mesa patches have been applied if you use &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa"&gt;xorg-edgers&lt;/a&gt; on Ubuntu which makes life a lot easier considering I spent four hours building my own fixed Mesa&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only this but there was a memory leak in Clutter (which I submitted patches for) which are now in their git master repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with both of those things fixed compositing windows using Clutter works brilliantly and will work for an extended period of time rather than falling over after a short time. Also if these patches are used on Moblin v2, you should get a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>It’s Aliiiive!</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/06/13/its-aliiiive.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-06-13T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-06-13:blog/2009/06/13/its-aliiiive.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This poor corner of the Internet has been neglected of late, and it is almost time for me to renew my domain.

The project itself is called libdlo and is available from &lt;a href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libdlo"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; with the Git repository &lt;a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libdlo/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;At the moment it is a low-level library for speaking to the device and is not yet wrapped in a Xorg driver. The code itself supports ASIC devices and only the USB versions (if that means something to you then you have probably worked for DisplayLink at some point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code itself is impressively documented, and means people should be able to get something up and running pretty fast. I&amp;#8217;m sure some interesting and exciting projects will come out of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done to DisplayLink on doing this &amp;#8211; this is going to be a really good thing for getting content onto displays.

So I come back home on Thursday plonk my Tales Of The Black Freighter into my Windows Media Center 2005 box and I get jerky video and crackly sound. So I then spend a day trying to diagnose the problem&amp;#8230;. Starting with making sure my Windows install is up to date with patches, new nVidia drivers (which managed to successfully break everything so I tried multiple versions), and new versions of the codecs I use. The best part was in Media Player I got no sound and fine video, but on Media Center I got jerky video and crackly sound. All from the same codec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided it was time try MythTV properly, so I nuked the drive with a Xubuntu install which crashed halfway through showing me the true nature of my problem when there was no turning back &amp;#8211; the DVD drive was dying. So I decided to proceed with my Linux install because I was on my way and liked the philosophy behind MythTV&amp;#8217;s design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now three days later I have a mostly working system, but I have had a number of casualties. First my DVD drive, then I blew up my monitor which I had to drive all the way to the office to collect, and now my graphics card is living on borrowed time (I will post about that in a bit). None of it is MythTV&amp;#8217;s or Ubuntu&amp;#8217;s fault, but I should of known when the weekend starts badly it can only get worse. I even got so desperate I considered installing Vista, but I am now really close to getting the whole system up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for MythTV itself &amp;#8211; the features it provides were exactly what I wanted, DVD, TV, CD music, random downloaded videos. But it has proved to be such a pain, some of it Xubuntu&amp;#8217;s fault, some of it is MythTV&amp;#8217;s, and my greatest share of pain has come from nVidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backend design of MythTV is a real good idea but it is painful to get up and running &amp;#8211; even with the nicely supplied packages. Especially if you decide to change your IP address or XMLTV stops working briefly. The setup user interface is designed to be used from a big screen, but is extremely unintuitive and counter to any GUI guidelines you have ever seen. It took about three attempts to get the hook up between XMLTV and my DVB-T card correct and in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frontend is okay, but is at least five years behind anything you have seen for media centers (they have a new version they are working on but there is no planned release yet). You have to fiddle around so you can successfully eject DVDs, get your remote set up (involving text configuration files) which works okay but not intuitively (the stop button doesn&amp;#8217;t do what I expect on a Windows MCE remote), watch DVDs (enable the correct repositories), and getting your Samba mounts working (why on earth aren&amp;#8217;t Samba shares an optional directory rather than having to mess around with fstab?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did try X-Box Media Center as a front-end for the MythTV backend. It is much nicer to look at, provides some real good features (with a great iPlayer plug-in), worked with the MCE remote flawlessly and sensibly, and is only lacking the ability to schedule recordings. If that was possible I would use that as a frontend, because it seems much more stable than the MythTV UI. I did also try Boxee, the commercial version of XBMC, but although it looked quite nice I found it was not as good as XBMC it is derived from and its MythTV frontend refused to work as it is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thoughts this weekend have gone from MCE2005 to MythTV to XBMC to Boxee to XBMC to MythTV&amp;#8230;. That also discounts the amount of time I sat down considering how I would write my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main work now is to get hibernate and suspend working, but that requires a post all of its own. At least at that point I will be functionally equivalent to my Windows MCE2005 install that I nuked.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>nVidia + Linux + ACPI = Borked</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/04/13/nvidia-linux-acpi-borked.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-04-13T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-04-13:blog/2009/04/13/nvidia-linux-acpi-borked.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a simple equation and has cost me a day of trying to get ACPI suspend/hibernate working on Linux. It took me long enough to realise it was the nVidia driver causing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I tried suspend or hibernate I would get a black screen with a flashing cursor in the top left. After working out it was the nVidia driver I tried all the remedies I could find on the Internet by other people with the same bug. What I discovered was this problem has been around for going on at least three years and no solution is being worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious articles are &lt;a href="http://www.amitsrivastava.net/2008-03-23-hibernate-suspend-resolved-ubuntu-gutsy-nvidia-dell-vostro/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaLaptopBinaryDriverSuspend"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-9755/README/appendix-f.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Talk:NVidia_Suspend_HOWTO"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://susewiki.org/index.php?title=Suspending_with_the_NVidia_drivers"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All solutions provide slightly different but the same solution, you need to set NvAGP in your xorg.conf to either 0 or 1 and optionally use agp=off for your kernel. I tried various concoctions and none of them worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I worked out what the problem is though. If your motherboard chipset is not nVidia (I think they call them nForce) then NvAGP will never work because mine always drops back to agpgart. This must be why most of the success is seen on laptops where the IGP must be using nVidia chipsets. My motherboard has a VIA chipset (old and crusty I know) with a GeForce 8500GT hence my complete and utter lack of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said this problem has been around for quite a while and the chipset problem could be why the only responses I have read from nVidia is that they are unable to reproduce it. So for me it will be a new sensible graphics card with hopefully fairly open drivers.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>XBMC MythTV Bridge</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/04/13/xbmc-mythtv-bridge.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-04-13T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-04-13:blog/2009/04/13/xbmc-mythtv-bridge.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It seems I spoke to soon, I stumbled across &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/mythbox/"&gt;MythBox&lt;/a&gt; just after posting about MythTV.

It was my first time running such a public speaking event. We had four people in attendance which made it a bit easier on me after four or five last minute drop-outs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it was to cover getting started in Python development from first concepts through to more advanced ones. I can hardly believe I talked more or less continually for six hours(!) I had prepared cue cards so I didn&amp;#8217;t forget any subjects I wanted to cover and had smushed together a load of examples to go with each subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most bizarre things was I didn&amp;#8217;t get onto the fact Python had classes until lunchtime at 1pm&amp;#8230;. It was hard to try and cover the basics because everything relied on something else, so I was dynamically juggling the order of the subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best bit was the interaction where people were coding whilst I was talking and the discussion points and questions came out of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it really hard to explain list comprehensions because I kind of instinctively knew them, but I had managed up until now to never need to explain them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of doing this class were many for me. First, up I had programmed in Python for a while but I just did it and didn&amp;#8217;t really think about why and how much I had used. Organising those thoughts was invaluable. Also, had to do speaking at the front of the room and I think I did okay apart from waving my hands too much and using the word &amp;#8220;mad&amp;#8221; too often in the description of Python features&amp;#8230; The other benefit was I learnt some things as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main Python feature I learnt was the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern"&gt;flyweight&lt;/a&gt; pattern feature of Python classes. Basically if you define a variable as part of the class you maximise reuse of that object. If you defined a variable using self, it will be added to the class dictionary. We checked this by writing code which is the best way to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know if I will end up running one again or if it is a one-off, but I will try to update my examples and subjects to reflect what I discovered throughout the day (if I actually transfer them to digital format rather than hand-written cards I&amp;#8217;ll post it on here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;#8217;d like to thank &lt;a href="http://www.red-gate.com/"&gt;Red Gate Software&lt;/a&gt; for supplying refreshments and somewhere to host it, &lt;a href="http://blog.software-acumen.com/"&gt;Mark Dalgarno&lt;/a&gt; for organising it, and Clive Tong of Red Gate for making sure we could get in (and not forgetting the attendees).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Watchmen</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/03/22/watchmen.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-03-22T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-03-22:blog/2009/03/22/watchmen.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since I am so behind the times I finally saw Watchmen the movie today&amp;#8230;.

In the end most people either roll their own or cheat (use xvfb and grab the pixmap). You could use &lt;a href="http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2009/01/15/capturing-web-pages/"&gt;Qt and grab the image&lt;/a&gt;, but it still requires xvfb, even if you write your own rendering backend (I assume for font stuff). There are a number of ways to solve the headless rendering problem, unfortunately not all of them are ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me I am looking at &lt;a href="http://code.staikos.net/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=webkit;a=shortlog;h=kenneth/efl-port"&gt;EFL WebKit&lt;/a&gt; as the best solution but it is not near maturity and because I quite like the way Enlightenment Foundation Libraries seem to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest possible solution(s) are born from the &lt;a href="http://clutter-project.org/"&gt;Clutter Project&lt;/a&gt; which is now under the guidance of Intel. There is &lt;a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/clutter"&gt;Clutter Webkit&lt;/a&gt; which provides a Clutter Actor for rendering webpages essentially to a Cairo surface on the 3D surface. I got it to compile last night and ran a test program but it was pretty slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other one is &lt;a href="http://git.o-hand.com/cgit.cgi/mozilla-headless/"&gt;mozilla-headless&lt;/a&gt; which looks really interesting by providing a Mozilla library that renders to a Cairo surface. &lt;a href="http://chrislord.net/"&gt;Chris Lord&lt;/a&gt; the main developer on this made presentation to FOSDEM available &lt;a href="http://chrislord.net/files/fosdem-09-slides.odp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a video of it in action &lt;a href="http://chrislord.net/images/mozilla/mozilla-magic.png"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (requires OGG codecs). The source is all available &lt;a href="http://git.o-hand.com/cgit.cgi/mozilla-headless/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the embedding into Clutter is available &lt;a href="http://git.clutter-project.org/?r=clutter-mozembed"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The source code for testing it is &lt;a href="http://git.clutter-project.org/cgit.cgi?url=clutter-mozembed/tree/tests"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a vaguely related note there is an interesting article about using gstreamer through Clutter&amp;#8217;s python bindings &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="http://luisbg.blogalia.com//historias/61951"&gt;awesome (gstreamer * clutter)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Open-Source CAD/CAM</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/02/15/open-source-cadcam.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-02-15T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-02-15:blog/2009/02/15/open-source-cadcam.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent over seven years working in the CAD/CAM industry. It&amp;#8217;s a very archaic industry with virtually no open-source building blocks available, and those that are tend be be extremely old or not even useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few green shoots of open-source out there. First up there is &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/wildcat-cad/"&gt;wildcat-cad&lt;/a&gt; which is an attempt to create an open-source 3D solid modelling kernel and associated tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/heekscad/"&gt;heekscad&lt;/a&gt; which is a modelling program using the &lt;a href="http://www.opencascade.org/"&gt;OpenCascade&lt;/a&gt; solid modelling kernel (GPL licensed I believe). There is also a CAM add-on for heekscad called &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/"&gt;heekscnc&lt;/a&gt; with a lot of associated libraries providing some good functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional program is &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/voxelcut/"&gt;voxelcut&lt;/a&gt; which allows for a solid machining simulation to see what damage you&amp;#8217;ll do to your hardened steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the libraries is &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/libarea/"&gt;libarea&lt;/a&gt; which is for area-clearance algorithms in CAM. This is normally one of the most closely guarded secrets in commercial CAD/CAM so it is interesting to see an open implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/libactp/"&gt;libactp&lt;/a&gt; is an adaptive clearance toolpath which originated from &lt;a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk"&gt;Freesteel&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;#8217;ve got it integrated into heekscnc so you can try it out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can keep track of a lot of this stuff through &lt;a href="http://heekscnc.blogspot.com/"&gt;Dan Heek&amp;#8217;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another unrelated program is &lt;monocam&gt; which uses C-sharp as a development language and has soem interesting algorithms like the drop cutter which provides the basis for most 3D machining algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The Little Box That Almost Could</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/02/15/the-little-box-that-almost-could.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-02-15T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-02-15:blog/2009/02/15/the-little-box-that-almost-could.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back I was looking at some small low-powered computer units.

&lt;p&gt;Also the &lt;a href="http://www.liantec.com/product/emboard/EMB-3700.htm"&gt;motherboards are available on their own&lt;/a&gt; with much more power processors (up to 1.5GHz passively cooled and 2.0GHz with a fan using VIA Eden ULV processors). The spec sheet is &lt;a href="http://download.liantec.com/download/datasheet/EMB-3700.pdf"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking quite deeply into this platform to test its potential. I wanted to run Linux on this and it had an in-built video decoding co-processor as well as 3D support through the CX700M chipset. Anyway I eventually managed to get &lt;a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/"&gt;Xubuntu&lt;/a&gt; running with Compiz effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem I found with the system is that the drivers are thoroughly inadequate and that the open-source support is nowhere to be seen without VIA helping by supplying the documentation for the video decoding acceleration. The GPU is a &lt;a href="http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/chipsets/c-series/cx700m/"&gt;CX700M&lt;/a&gt; and the binary drivers are &lt;a href="http://www.viaarena.com/default.aspx?PageID=420&amp;amp;OSID=25&amp;amp;CatID=2580&amp;amp;SubCatID=184"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; and the official drivers are &lt;a href="http://linux.via.com.tw/support/downloadFiles.action"&gt;available from VIA&lt;/a&gt; (Ubuntu 8.10 currently). With these the 3D support is okay apart from some font rendering issues when using Compiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the older drivers supply the support for the video decoding co-processor. Unfortunately I could not get a version working with a current version of Ubuntu, which in turn even if it did work would not have supported the 3D graphics properly. Also in order to make use of it you have to jump through a number of extra hoops and also operate as root which is a good security risk(!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two specialised version of the media players that VIA has customised to make use of the drivers that supply the MPEG-2/4/h.264 and WMV9 acceleration. These are &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/viaexp"&gt;VeXP (Via Xine Player)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vemp"&gt;VeMP (the VIA enhanced mPlayer)&lt;/a&gt;. I did put them into Git repositories starting from the base they branched from so I could work out what the patches did. They rely on closed-source library called libddmpeg.so that is part of some of the older drivers which provides the interface to the video acceleration hardware. This in turn relies n &lt;a href="http://www.trilithium.com/johan/2005/08/linux-gate/"&gt;linuxgate.so.1&lt;/a&gt; which provides a direct interface into the kernel for interrupts and the suchlike. This probably explains why all these things if you can get them to work require root access. I did try grabbing the library from an older driver and using it on a newer driver, which would have been too good to be true if it worked (it didn&amp;#8217;t but at least I didn&amp;#8217;t kill the system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place to go for drivers and utilities is &lt;a href="http://www.viaarena.com/"&gt;VIA Arena&lt;/a&gt; where they maintain all the older legacy downloads as only the bleeding edge are available on the official VIA website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a special version of &lt;a href="http://www.puppylinux.org/downloads/puplets/mcpup"&gt;Puppy Linux&lt;/a&gt; that is optimised for the platform. The development website is &lt;a href="http://www.mcpup.org/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately the media player supplied is not the one that makes use of the co-processor functionality, well it didn&amp;#8217;t for me anyway. Maybe this s worth revisiting again at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a blog covering the Microclient Sr &lt;a href="http://microclient.wordpress.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and a Google Group discussin it &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microclient"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a good &lt;a href="http://nettops.fr/index.php"&gt;comprehensive website (in French)&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, a couple of reviews are &lt;a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS9828354233.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT4708024578.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really cool bit of it with nothing else in its price range/features. Unfortunately the Linux support is such a headache, if it worked I would be extremely happy and it would be very interesting to see how it functions with video and 3D. The tiny little box can even do insanely high resolutions of 1920&amp;#215;1440 which would be very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

Venue: &lt;a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge"&gt;Microsoft Research Centre Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers have one of the most complex and difficult roles on a project, yet XP and Scrum include very few practices that support the Customer in their role. Over the last five years, we have investigated many projects around the world to identify how Customers succeed in this complex and difficult task — discovering not what people think should have happened, but what really happened and what actually worked! By the end of this talk you will have gained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A realistic understanding of the complexity and difficulty of the Customer role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An understanding of the key roles required on the Customer team, both what they are and why they matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An understanding of the eight practices that enable Customers to sustainably drive Agile projects to successful completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angela Martin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela has over fourteen years of industry experience and has been applying agile techniques since 2003. She specializes in &amp;#8220;building the right thing&amp;#8221; and works closely with organizational stakeholders, end-users, business analysts and software developers to bring agility into this space. Angela has recently moved to the University of Waikato, New Zealand. At Waikato, she will be continuing her research into agile and she will also be teaching a number of under-graduate courses. providing both an agile and industry perspective to the content. She will also continue to teach the popular Agile Methods course within the Software Engineering Programme at Oxford University.

I tried everything that a sane person would and then some. I tried Nouveau, Ubuntu&amp;#8217;s various versions in their repository, and the ones direct from nVidia. The closest I had to working was the beta 1.80 which kept crashing&amp;#8230; When 1.80 was officially released I tried that and that did not work at all with a completely black screen (like the other official version I tried).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my solution was to order from Play an &lt;a href="http://www.play.com/PC/PCs/4-/7871884/Play-Value-ATI-Radeon-HD-2600-Pro-512MB-PCI-E-Graphics-Card/Product.html?cm_mmc=Froogle-_-PC-_-Components-_-Play%2BValue%2BATI%2BRadeon%2BHD%2B2600%2BPro%2B%2F%2B512MB%2B%2F%2BPCI-E%2B%2F%2BGraphics%2BCard&amp;amp;source=5066&amp;amp;engine=froogle_pc&amp;amp;keyword=Play+Value+ATI+Radeon+HD+2600+Pro+%2F+512MB+%2F+PCI-E+%2F+Graphics+Card"&gt;ATi HD2600 Pro&lt;/a&gt; for £30. It&amp;#8217;s even got 512Meg on board which is a huge amount of memory. The main reason for this was an eye on the future for proper open-source support, that although is not currently comprehensive will improve in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I plugged the card in after cleaning out all remnants of all nVidia drivers, rebooted and it worked straight away. I enabled the closed-source ATi drivers and got all eye candy working as well. Ultimately I will use the RadeonHD driver that is open source in XOrg repositories, but it isn&amp;#8217;t quite complete. You can also keep track of available features in a handy table &lt;a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am happily able to use Ubuntu at 1920&amp;#215;1200 with useful 3D features like Expose and desktop expose.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Cool Enlightenment Stuff</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/01/11/cool-enlightenment-stuff.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-01-11T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-01-11:blog/2009/01/11/cool-enlightenment-stuff.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with the EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) &lt;a href="http://code.staikos.net/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=webkit;a=shortlog;h=kenneth/efl-port"&gt;port of WebKit&lt;/a&gt; and I have been very impressed by the quality of the page rendering. In fact I have been playing around with Enlightenment E17 libraries, although I haven&amp;#8217;t gone the whole hog and installed the desktop environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of the building blocks that have been put together are extremely impressive with multiple rendering backends for the Evas canvas including X11, OpenGL, Windows and Quartz. It&amp;#8217;s a highly optimised canvas to build UIs with. I&amp;#8217;ve spent some time reading the source to work out how it all fits together. I liked the &amp;#8220;buffer&amp;#8221; backend for Evas that allows you to render to that engine and capture the output as a buffer of bytes, but in order to use it there was no massive difference in code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress, on my travels through the internet I found a few interesting projects related to Enlightenment e17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up there is a comprehensive skin for the Enlightenment areas that require it. It is called &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/detour/"&gt;Detour (DTR)&lt;/a&gt; and looks clean and consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up I found &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/itask-module/"&gt;iTask&lt;/a&gt; (and its relations iTask-NG and WinList-NG) which are new taskbars for Enlightenment. These look good and provide integration with compositing with the NG versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the best thing I found was someone had put e17 together with the compositing of Compiz called &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/itask-module/wiki/Stuff"&gt;ecomorph&lt;/a&gt;. This is an alpha project but is showing some impressive results. There is a three part video : &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHbQ0ASlzCQ"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G9hr-izzn4"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21VURWljN4A"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;. Also you can see a super dark demo &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5gDEiJpBwI"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enlightenment has not been at the forefront unfortunately because of a lack of official e17 release, but hopefully that will be rectified in the near future, mainly because a lot of the framework provided could be really useful (and it is a British thing to root for the underdog).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Link Failing Touch</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/01/11/link-failing-touch.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-01-11T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-01-11:blog/2009/01/11/link-failing-touch.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://i.gizmodo.com/5128355/as-seen-at-ces-microsoft-surface-fail"&gt;As Seen at CES: Microsoft Surface Fail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I hadn&amp;#8217;t heard of it until today but it is interesting to see a few other operating systems out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is aimed more at desktop users rather than techies as an ultimate goal. Still, it is early days and requires hacking abilities to be able to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially it is a new kernel written in C with some libraries ported to it to provide other functionality. The kernel itself is based mainly on Unix ideas but has decided to move some bits around to be more intuitive (like /usr/bin/ and the suchlike).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphics are based on &lt;a href="http://alperakcan.org/?open=projects&amp;amp;project=xynth"&gt;xynth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://www.whitix.org/screenshots/"&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt; look pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it&amp;#8217;s early days for the Whitix project but it should be interesting to see what it offers in the long term and how it differentiates itself as it matures.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Link Backlog</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/01/06/link-backlog.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-01-06T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-01-06:blog/2009/01/06/link-backlog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/01/06/cookie-monster-eats.html"&gt;Cookie Monster eats World Trade towers in 1976&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Venue: &lt;a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge"&gt;Microsoft Research Centre Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synopsis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many organisations, especially small to medium businesses and public sector bodies, are failing to initiate valuable projects. They read statistics such as the Chaos Reports and get scared of the risks of project failure. They talk to IT companies and get confused by the technical jargon. They don&amp;#8217;t trust the consultancy industry to help them navigate this maze. So they don&amp;#8217;t initiate projects that might actually deliver a lot of value. Or if they do initiate projects, they bound them with such tight &amp;#8220;risk mitigation&amp;#8221; practices &amp;#8211; heavyweight procurement processes, long contractual negotiations, burdensome project oversight structures &amp;#8211; that an atmosphere of mistrust and bureaucracy is built in from the outset. This, perversely, increases the risk of failure even further, creating the conditions for an escalating &amp;#8220;cycle of mistrust&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mistrust hurts all of us. Organisations are forgoing potential benefits. Developers are forgoing potential work. Or if we do get work, it&amp;#8217;s set up for failure from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the film industry, insurance is used to mitigate some of this mistrust. Independent film producers often need to arrange &amp;#8220;completion bonds&amp;#8221; in order to obtain financing for their films. These are effectively insurance policies that projects will deliver on time and on budget. The financier pays a premium to an independent third party (the guarantor), who then monitors the project and ensures it stays on track. And if it doesn&amp;#8217;t, then the guarantor repays the original financing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could this work for IT projects? This talk will look at the role of the guarantor, and the way they might help break the cycle of mistrust in many of our current IT projects. I don&amp;#8217;t have definitive answers, but I do have some thoughts and many questions, so I hope we&amp;#8217;ll have an interesting discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graham Oakes helps people untangle complex technology, relationships, processes and governance. As an independent consultant, he helps organisations such as Sony Computer Entertainment, The Open University, the Council of Europe and the Port of Dover to define strategy, initiate projects and hence run those projects effectively. Prior to going independent, he was Director of Technology at Sapient Limited, where he ran the project review process for the UK Business Unit. Before that he was Head of Project Management for Psygnosis Ltd (a subsidiary of Sony), where he ran Independent Project Assurance teams working across the UK, Europe and the USA. His book &amp;#8220;Project Reviews, Assurance and Governance&amp;#8221; was published by Gower in October, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#8217;d share some of the problems I had just in case some other people find my solutions useful since from my Googling I notice quite a few people have some issues. I think also I made the problem a bit worse because I am using 64-bit on my Core2Duo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem #1&lt;/strong&gt; : Can&amp;#8217;t get my nVidia GeForce 6600GT to work with the nVidia binary blobs. I was using the latest out of the repositories and then tried the latest from nVidia and all I got was a blank screen and some not very helpful logs. I was getting seriously annoyed after hours of hacking at X configuration files and different nVidia drivers, almost to the point I was going to go out and buy an ATi in the hope open source or at least better drivers would be forthcoming.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Solution #1&lt;/strong&gt; : The way I ended up having to solve it was using the &lt;a href="ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/"&gt;Beta 1.80 drivers from nVidia&lt;/a&gt;. Definitely not an ideal solution because I have now discovered problem #2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem #2&lt;/strong&gt; : Songbird 1.0.0 won&amp;#8217;t work. There are two places to get 64-bit debs for &lt;a href="http://getsongbird.com"&gt;Songbird&lt;/a&gt; which are both listed &lt;a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Songbird"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It won&amp;#8217;t start though &amp;#8211; bah! On closer investigation glibc is complaining about and invalid free() call. In the callstack you can see the &lt;a href="http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=124972"&gt;culprit is the nVidia driver&lt;/a&gt;. So now I have to ask myself do I want Songbird or a proper nVidia driver, but Firefox does work with no problems for me. There is also a report of the problem at the &lt;a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/songbird/topics/glibc_2_8_detects_invalid_free_pointer"&gt;Songbird customer service site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem #3&lt;/strong&gt; : Sound didn&amp;#8217;t work for my motherboard. I knew the chip and driver required which was a &lt;em&gt;snd-via82xx&lt;/em&gt; (serves me right for using such a cheapskate sound solution). So a quick &lt;em&gt;sudo nano /etc/modules&lt;/em&gt; and adding the driver name to the end of the file fixed that problem. It just needed a restart for the kernel to pick up the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, enough about problems, I am very impressed now I have the basic system up and running. The desktop effects are extremely nice and non-intrusive. You need to install the &amp;#8220;Advanced Desktop Effects Settings (ccsm)&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Compiz Fusion Icon&amp;#8221; to gain access to the UI for customisation. I did a few minor tweaks mainly to switch off wobbly windows and enable the Expose-a-like &amp;#8220;Scale&amp;#8221;. In general the user interface all looks great. If you don&amp;#8217;t have the graphics card problems I have there is a good set of instructions &lt;a href="http://reformedmusings.wordpress.com/2008/12/09/compiz-fusion-in-ubuntu-810-intrepid/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on getting the drivers and running Compiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also installed Flash 10 (for x64) and it worked flawlessly. I even managed to watch the Dr Who announcement on the iPlayer Watch BBC One Now option. Flash does eat CPU but it seems to work fine apart from the fullscreen option on iPlayer. And obviously Firefox is as good as ever. I&amp;#8217;ve installed &lt;a href="http://www.screenlets.org/"&gt;Screenlets&lt;/a&gt; and used the widget layer available in Compiz for the OSX-like Dashboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did next was to install &lt;a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/"&gt;Virtualbox 2.1&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads"&gt;repository method&lt;/a&gt; (to override the ones available from Ubuntu). Then I proceeded to install Windows XP that was on this machine in the VM. After finding the right disk installation was faster than when it was actually on the hardware as were reboots. I am really impressed with this. It even activated first time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have a properly working system I can say that the 12 hours I spent (mostly trying to fix the unfixable) doing this was more than worthwhile because it boots fast, lets me work fast, and is completely controllable. The only hope I have is that there are some mature open-source video drivers (with 3D) out there in the future because then I will know which cards to buy for minimal hair loss. Also I swear the Ubuntu installation takes about ten minutes maximum compared to the unwieldy Windows installation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Webkit Ported To EFL</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2009/01/04/webkit-ported-to-efl.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-01-04T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2009-01-04:blog/2009/01/04/webkit-ported-to-efl.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) now has a &lt;a href="http://codeposts.blogspot.com/2008/12/webkit-ported-to-enlightenment.html"&gt;port for Webkit&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve tried compiling it and using it on my Gnome VM and it works really well. The main missing parts are the NPAPI plug-ins rendering and the video tag support. Since this is an early stage all things will come in time (like video will probably use the Enlightenment Emotion engine). &lt;a href="http://codeposts.blogspot.com/2008/12/webkit-efl-receives-its-first-patch.html"&gt;Patches&lt;/a&gt; are also coming along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like about Enlightenment and its libraries is that they are all well-defined meaning it has lots of rendering back-ends like DirectFB, Cairo, X11, OpenGL, and tons more. The libraries are all lightweight enough for embedded devices making them even more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has even been some work about wrapping the Webkit rendering in a user interface (apart from the example one available in the WebKit git) and it has a really good name &lt;a href="http://blog.gustavobarbieri.com.br/2008/12/22/webkit-efl-interface-prototype/"&gt;ewww&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This upgrade breaks quite a few plugins because they are no longer necessary like the one I used to give the admin interface drop down menus.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s an interesting endeavor because you rarely get an opportunity to go back and correct the decay that inevitably happens. Since I am a newbie in the grand scheme of things to Python none of it looks particularly difficult to grasp or even change your code to do. I suppose if you have a large and crufty code base doing scary things it might be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of bytes have been flying around the Internet either in support or more commonly against the Python 3.0 work. So for the prosecution you have posts like &lt;a href="http://mooseyard.com/Jens/2008/12/python-30-whats-the-point/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, posts in the middle like &lt;a href="http://www.cmlenz.net/archives/2008/12/py3k"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, or the defence like &lt;a href="http://sayspy.blogspot.com/2008/12/whats-with-30-hatin.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. You do get &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/library/2to3.html"&gt;tools to help&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://sayspy.blogspot.com/2008/12/python-30-porting-docs-started-in-wiki.html"&gt;start of some docs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing to come out of the Python 3.0 release discussion is &lt;a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2008/dec/05/python-3000/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;m sure everyone who has had to work on legacy systems will know the monkeys, the cage, and the firehose. It&amp;#8217;s always good to test that the firehose is actually on&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>A Ride Into The Bizarre</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/12/08/a-ride-into-the-bizarre.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-12-08T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-12-08:blog/2008/12/08/a-ride-into-the-bizarre.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was at the University of Essex I won the Bowden Memorial Prize in my first year. Nothing too odd about that, but then in a magazine whilst I was at Uni I read an article that mentioned Dr Keith Bowden of the Computer Science Department dying in mysterious circumstances in 1982. My interest was piqued but details were hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the whizzy days of the Internet and more public access to archives I seem to only be able to find one article that mentions him. All other links all lead back to either the article or reproductions thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all relates to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative"&gt;Strategic Defense Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (or Star Wars as it is better known). Apparently the scientists working on it started dying with alarming frequency of dubious circumstances. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it is any more statistically interesting than any other sampling of people over the same period (so I am not peddling some conspiracy theory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the articles can be found here &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="http://codshit.blogspot.com/2007/09/did-22-sdi-researchers-really-all.html"&gt;Did 22 SDI Researchers really ALL Commit Suicide?&lt;/a&gt; From what I can tell noone ever bothered to actually try and research it and everything just reprints the same thing.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cambridgebusinesslectures.com/"&gt;Tim Campbell &amp;#8211; Cambridge Business Lectures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Covered a lot of ground up from his start in business, through the Apprentice, up to his current venture. What you can tell from his talk is that he is doing what he wants to do now rather than what is expected of him. His current venture is a registered charity that helps young people start up business mainly if they are from disadvantaged backgrounds. I must admit business oriented talks don&amp;#8217;t really do it for me and this was no exception because it always ends up being about the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/WhenGoodArchitectureGoesBad"&gt;When Good Architecture Goes Bad &amp;#8211; BCS SPA Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For the restart of the Cambridge BCS SPA meetings we have Mark Dalgarno&amp;#8217;s talk. I&amp;#8217;ve attended &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2008/04/accu-2008-conference.html"&gt;this one before&lt;/a&gt;. The talk is an interactive session where you have to spot architectural decay and how to stem it and possible reverse it. It&amp;#8217;s a good session for getting to know your fellow attendees as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.software-east.co.uk/"&gt;Model Driven Development and Software Product Lines &amp;#8211; Software East&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There were two talks for the fee here. First up there was &lt;em&gt;Danilo Beuche &amp;#8211; Get started with Software Product Lines&lt;/em&gt;. This covered the theory behind building up a software product line and also showed some of the tool that is used to manage it through Eclipse. It is much more relevant for companies with many products all containing small variations. The second talk was &lt;em&gt;Steven Kelly &amp;#8211; Moving from Coding to Model-Driven Development&lt;/em&gt;. This was the stronger of the two talks. The way I read it was that it is a large layer of abstraction to improve productivity and to ower thebarrier for entry for solving problems in the problem domain. The examples mainly involve diagrams (or UML) for it but I think a good DSL would do the trick as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chase.org.uk/?q=node/258"&gt;Liquavista &amp;#8211; CHASE Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was a talk about new monitor technology company and how you bring technology to market. It was about using electrowetting to make reflective displays (rather than the current backlit world). If the technology does take off you will get cheaper displays and lower power displays. They are currently pushing out actual product in watches in order to have something on the market rather than simply relying on being a technology and licensing company with no released product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Event sponsored by Red Gate Software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Synopsis: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Microsoft Visual Studio provides a great set of development tools out of the box, but you may be surprised at how much more you can do with its rich extensibility platform. In this introductory session, we will give you a whirlwind tour of what the Visual Studio Extensibility (VSX) platform has to offer and how you can take advantage of it. Whether you are looking to increase you development team&amp;#8217;s productivity, or you are looking for new business opportunities on the Visual Studio platform, this technical session will help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Jean-Marc Prieur &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jean-Marc Prieur is the Program Manager of Microsoft&amp;#8217;s Visual Studio Extensibility Team. After studying at L’Ecole Supérieure d&amp;#8217;Electricité (Supelec), and gaining a Master of Science at Caltech (focusing on Concurrent Computing and Computational Neural Systems), Jean-Marc worked for the French Navy managing Operational Research and Simulation. He is passionate about software modelling, in particular graphical software modelling, meta-modelling and code generating. He is also an extremely passionate early adopter of DSL Tools. Jean-Marc founded the French DSL community with a group of friends, which ran several labs, workshops on DSL Tools, and a VSX Day in Paris (&lt;a href="http://www.dslfactory.org/" target="_top"&gt;http://www.dslfactory.org&lt;/a&gt;). He joined the Cambridge Visual Studio Ecosystem Team in March 2008 as a Program Manager, and is working with the VSX team to add new features to DSL Tools and enhancing the Visual Studio SDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently the code only works on Windows (mainly because the Chromium source is not yet fully ported). The reason for using Crome over vanilla Webkit is that it uses its own rendering framework to deliver pixels from multiple processes to the main program window. This means you can use that rendering pipeline more easily because it is not so reliant on platform specifics and uses Skia to put the content together. From what I have tried to work out writing a backend for Webkit is a non-trivial process and tends to require lots of extra plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest version of Awesomium even lets you use the Flash plugin for extra rendering goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    The BCS SPA Cambridge talks are about to start again running monthly from November through to June. These are computing talks that are free to attend with a light buffet. The talks are also moving back to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge"&gt;Microsoft Research Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    On November 12th at 7pm &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://blog.software-acumen.com/"&gt;Mark Dalgarno&lt;/a&gt; is doing his talk &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/WhenGoodArchitectureGoesBad"&gt;“When Good Architectures Go Bad”&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As software evolves its architecture ‘as-is’ deviates from its architecture ‘as-hoped-for’ – the software is said to erode.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Software Erosion can be a problem because:&lt;br /&gt; - the time, effort and risk in implementing further changes increases
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      - the effect of further changes becomes harder to predict&lt;br /&gt; - further changes typically cause the ‘as-is’ architecture to deviate further from the ‘as-hoped-for’ architecture – the situation becomes worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      This session looks at examples of software erosion and explores practices to prevent or slow such decay. Participants should come prepared with architectural ‘war stories’. There will be a couple of group exercises but no test at the end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    This will be a good session to meet other attendees and to tell your war stories and stories of hope (although I think the bad ones are always more entertaining).

It&amp;#8217;s the latest version of the extremely useful peer reviewed C++ libraries that a large portion of has fed into the latest C++ standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one new library this time out which is Boost.Proto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proto is a framework for building Domain Specific Embedded Languages in C++. It provides tools for constructing, type-checking, transforming and executing expression templates. More specifically, Proto provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An expression tree data structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mechanism for giving expressions additional behaviors and members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operator overloads for building the tree from an expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilities for defining the grammar to which an expression must conform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An extensible mechanism for immediately executing an expression template.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An extensible set of tree transformations to apply to expression trees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are the usual myriad of bug fixes with the other libraries. They are still following their regular release cycles which is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Mac Coding For Windows</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/10/29/mac-coding-for-windows.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-10-29T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-10-29:blog/2008/10/29/mac-coding-for-windows.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Write a Cocoa application, create a new target and compile it for Windows.

&lt;p&gt;Tim Campbell, the winner of the first series of The Apprentice, is coming to Cambridge. Tim will talking on “Much sugar is a good thing: the power of mentoring”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim stands out from other Apprentice contestants &amp;#8211; and winners &amp;#8211; as being a man of substance and depth as well as charisma.

&lt;p&gt;Tim will be talking at Robinson College, Cambridge at 5:30pm on Monday November 10th. The event is free, but you need to &lt;a href="http://www.regonline.co.uk/Checkin.asp?EventId=655098"&gt;book a place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I am not overly enamoured by the default theme, mainly the blandness and the window padding which since using my Mac I know is an unnecessary luxury (also to make Vista more manageable make sure you get rid of the crazy 4 pixel window padding).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use the &lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/DustTheme"&gt;Dust theme&lt;/a&gt; because it is understated, looks clean and by default using no window padding. The main bonus is that there is a Firefox theme as well, and as I spend most of my life with open web browsers it deals with that minor niggle of consistency. The screenshots that you will see by following the above link will show you it is well thought out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5064515/ubuntu-810-gets-optional-darkroom-theme"&gt;Lifehacker have posted today&lt;/a&gt; there is a new theme called DarkRoom with Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex.

You can watch the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/#designvideo"&gt;video here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see I used to write software that did exactly that kind of machining up until about 10 months ago. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing"&gt;CAM&lt;/a&gt; programming is not for the faint-hearted. Seeing proper videos online of what CAM software actually does is something of a rarity since most CAD/CAM companies obfuscate their online presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video you can see lots of liquid coolant being pumped onto the solid block whilst the cutter does the hard work. I&amp;#8217;m just wondering what software is being used to create the toolpaths, especially since there are only a handful of packages capable of doing it, as well as a lot of them use the same algorithms internally. In fact whoever&amp;#8217;s software is doing it should be shouting it from the rooftops, its the closest thing the CAM industry has had to publicity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see the &amp;#8220;back&amp;#8221; of the laptop shell you can see the toolpath&amp;#8217;s route around the job. It seems to have a large stepover (the gap between paths). I&amp;#8217;d be interested to know how long each one takes to run the toolpath because &lt;a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk"&gt;I know someone&lt;/a&gt; who is really good at writing this type of software.

The original &lt;a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=532"&gt;post by Eric Raymond&lt;/a&gt; was linked to from &lt;a href="http://osnews.com/comments/20381"&gt;OSNews&lt;/a&gt; and had &lt;a href="http://www.blogistan.co.uk/blog/mt.php/2008/10/10/the_enduring_appeal_of_c"&gt;a very considered response here&lt;/a&gt;. Each language has its good and bad points, the same as anything on this planet. The ire should be pointed at bad programmers, bad education, bad communication and a lack of cold detachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason the workman quote came into my head wasn&amp;#8217;t a reflection on the programmers making these statements (they are much more talented and prolific than I am). They have obviously been burnt by bad code that they feel could have been avoided if the language was better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feeling is that it is always easy to attack something and attempt to tear it down. For something that seems like a scientific field like programming there is virtually no scientific basis for these intuitions apart from anecdotal evidence which is pretty much worthless. All programming languages have good and bad points, some notionally target different domains and some attempt to solve other problems. Some of these problems can involve attempting to lower the cognitive barrier for entry or error rates in less able/interested programmers. A lot of arguments against could easily substitute other programming languages and the articles sound just as feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad programmers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Noone is ever pleased with the quality of their code, but some programmers use dangerous constructs and are simply not qualified to write code. This can colour your own experience of working with a programming language because the human brain is extremely adept at constructing relationships that are simply not there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Education is important. Having a good basis in mathematics is always a good start, but also being taught the basis of programming in a language neutral form is extremely important. Also when you get to specific languages you are taught the concepts in a fashion that you can see why and how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important aspect though is squarely on the shoulders of the programmer, it is their responsibility to carry on their own development, mainly due to a lack of professional bodies like what exists in other professions to keep their skills up to date. When these two elements align hopefully a programmer can think critically when given the time about the underlying basis of what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Inability to articulate reasoning for decisions is obviously bad, but that isn&amp;#8217;t the biggest problem. It is political communication where attempting to win an argument is done through negative methods. Whether it is true or not it is damaging anyway and obfuscates any real issues that could be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lack of cold detachment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is seriously difficult to do. We are all guilty of these and it takes a massive amount of effort to achieve. You have to ask yourself what are your goals? To seek out the truth or to win the argument at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve programmed in a number of programming languages and they all have good and bad points. If someone says there is a bad point about one of them with good reasoning then I either find a workaround or no to avoid it. That is purely pragmatic and does not on its own make a bad language, and even a long list of these does not do so, because each one can have a list just as long. By removing your own personal gut feelings from the equation you can see that any argument is just wasting time from presenting good and solid solutions to problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even statistics can be manipulated to say what you want by loading the test. I have seen massive differences in synthetic benchmarks when compared to real-world applications, which normally comes from creating the benchmark when you already know the result you want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would be good would be a programming wiki where people looked at the problems and then provide answers to make programming better. I guess this sounds to me like peer-reviewed papers so maybe a better way of accessing good quality papers and knowing their quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all providing solutions is what programmers do, right?&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Biometric Linkage</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/10/09/biometric-linkage.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-10-09T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-10-09:blog/2008/10/09/biometric-linkage.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/oct/07/database.nation"&gt;Database nation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This will massively simplify the problem of writing an application that has multiple processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with multiprocessing before is that you spend ages writing a framework and boilerplate to do things like messaging, monitoring, and starting/stopping processes. This is a right pain and has its own share of bugs. You need to think how to pass state between the processes normally resorting to using the stdout/stdin mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiprocessing module provides an interface indistinguishable from the &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html"&gt;threading&lt;/a&gt; interface. It means you end up writing multiple processes in the same way you would write threads &amp;#8211; which is pretty darn easy. The only guilt you will feel when you use it is when you are chucking away bucketfulls of redundant code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this also will make it really easy to share logging between processes which if you do manually you will be finding problems until the end of time. This is especially interesting with a rotating log because you won&amp;#8217;t have to worry about multiple processes making different decisions. I don&amp;#8217;t know what the communication overhead will be for using it though&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also with this library you are given ways to synchronise between processes and you can even share data. These are obviously going to have a lot of applications and be extremely useful.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Some More Illustrations</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/10/08/some-more-illustrations.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-10-08T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-10-08:blog/2008/10/08/some-more-illustrations.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the pen and ink illustration that was doctored to make the poster for &lt;a href="http://www.transforce.org.uk/"&gt;Transforce&lt;/a&gt; 2001.

You can see the what&amp;#8217;s new &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.6.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This is going to make &lt;a href="http://www.macports.org/"&gt;MacPorts&lt;/a&gt; much more complicated&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious addition is the support for the version 3.0 support. There is a -3 switch to check for future incompatibilities as well as all the new features and syntax. It seems to essentially provide the 3.0 features without breaking backwards compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new look of the documentation is easy on the eyes and it all helps make it much easier to navigate. Documentation is normally an unloved part of most projects, but they have done a really good job &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;with&lt;/strong&gt; statement has been added which means you can now write context managers. These things seem to simulate enforced scoping (like you would have in things like C++). Additionally there are some new packages including multiprocessing, fractions, JSON, and a propertylist parser. Obviously multiprocessing has been in the news recently thanks to the Google Chrome browser, and this will simplify other people trying to go the same route (I&amp;#8217;d only recommend doing it on making sure your platform/OS allows for quick process creation if you are using lots of them). Obviously the JSON support will be handy for web developers and should simplify some web frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

So I&amp;#8217;ll be posting some of it interspersed with my usual developer ramblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is for an illustration that ended up on the back cover of &lt;strong&gt;Transformers: Alignment Volume 1&lt;/strong&gt; which was a special story bookending the Transformers comics mythos written by Simon Furman. This magazine was designed by &lt;a href="http://www.the-hub.co.uk"&gt;Graham Thomson&lt;/a&gt; and was an exclusive for &lt;a href="http://www.transforce.org.uk/"&gt;Transforce 2001 run by Paul Cannon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve put up two versions &amp;#8211; one has a simplified background which I think looks much less cluttered, but the WarWorlds you can see flying through space are part of the story. I&amp;#8217;ll scan in the original black and white image as well to show some of the process in the colouring when I can find an A3 scanner. The images on Flickr are 1600&amp;#215;1200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image was inspired by this passage in the original treatment by Simon Furman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybertron, three hundred years after Unicron: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by the insane warlord GALVATRON, the Decepticons have built and mobilised a vast fleet of Warworlds; moon-sized ships with awesome destructive firepower. In order to safeguard Cybertron, the Autobots have relocated their world, using technology appropriated from former Decepticon general Jhiaxus to clone other ‘Cybertrons’ from barren, uninhabited (non-metal) worlds. These decoys serve both to mislead and divide the enemy, but new intelligence has led the Decepticon fleet tantalisingly close to the location of the real Cybertron. A massed Autobot armada engages the Decepticons at Pinea Omicron in an attempt to end the conflict once and for all. Huge losses are sustained by both sides, and OPTIMUS PRIME finally destroys Galvatron… but at considerable cost to himself. Severely wounded, his power reserves decimated, he hovers at death’s door and the Autobots place him in protective stasis. &lt;/p&gt;

With the iPod Nano 4G they have added more options with large fonts access and a spoken interface.

Certainly thinking back to when I started working as a developer I would never have predicted I&amp;#8217;d be doing what I am now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2000 I started out as a C++ developer on Windows for user interface work. The user interface was MFC which will strike fear into the hearts of some programmers, and the source control system was Visual SourceSafe (bear in mind the initial release of Subversion was around the same date I started). This was the initial baptism in commercial realities of development and my first interaction with real talented developers who actually got software out of the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 I experienced my first takeover. My job description didn&amp;#8217;t really change although I wasn&amp;#8217;t a graduate any more. The type of development work I was doing was moving out of the original GUI type work into a more generalised area. Even at one point I ended up deploying a bug database company-wide running a custom version of Bugzilla, which was equal parts interesting and a complete nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005 I went back to my original company, and this was where my development career started to get much more interesting. During that time I worked on the building blocks of the system and dipped into areas that would not have been seen as my comfort area like the serious heavy maths. I ended up trying to learn more and push myself, after all people out there have solved the same problems, so I joined &lt;a href="http://bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge"&gt;SPA Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://accu.org"&gt;ACCU&lt;/a&gt;. During this period at work I moved the company over to Subversion, re-vamped the build system and installer, and got the 64-bit release done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another takeover I decided it was time to move on again, and to hopefully continue learning. Unfortunately this move didn&amp;#8217;t work out, although I did pick up a couple of things during that time, and learnt a bit about what I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads me to my current job at &lt;a href="http://www.camvine.com"&gt;Camvine&lt;/a&gt; where I am learning lots of new stuff. This means I am having a huge amount of fun. Also, because it is a start-up, the company is of a size and mentality that makes me feel at home. In the space of about ten weeks(ish) I&amp;#8217;ve had to learn Python, new technologies, lots about networking, and (finally) lead an almost Microsoft free lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, since starting my professional career in October 2000, in (almost) October 2008 I am getting to do work I suppose I would have dreamed of if I knew it was what I wanted to do. I think it shows that your career can evolve into unexpected and exciting areas.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>I Didn’t Let It Defeat Me</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/09/26/i-didnt-let-it-defeat-me.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-09-26T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-09-26:blog/2008/09/26/i-didnt-let-it-defeat-me.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I was having a bit of an unhappy time attempting to get GTK+ to compile successfully. My determination has finally paid off and I got it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out I built Glib and GTK+ from their respective trunks so I could guarantee they were in sync. But what I was trying to achieve was to use a Git master tracking branch and I finally discovered my own ineptitude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git pull . master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is your friend and pulls the changes from the master and applies them to your branch. I then tried to compile it and it worked!

What you really need in that instance is a good merge tool to make it easy. When I used &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; on Windows I used &lt;a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/"&gt;KDiff3&lt;/a&gt; which did most merges automatically and made three-way merges pretty painless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Git on OSX the default mergetool is the built in file diff, which is pretty useless when it comes to merge hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the KDiff3 integration article &lt;a href="http://notch8.com/articles/2008/06/06/kdiff3-git-win"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but there is some kind of bug in KDiff3 that means that it does not save the files correctly even if you set up the merge manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is good news with &lt;a href="http://blog.logicalrand.com/2008/9/9/use-p4merge-or-diffmerge-with-git-mergetool-on-os-x"&gt;this logical.rand article&lt;/a&gt; which shows you how to integrate &lt;a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/"&gt;Diffmerge&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/products/merge.html"&gt;p4merge&lt;/a&gt;.

Over the past few days I have lost many hours of my spare time attempting to compile a branch of GTK+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went down the obvious route of installing the development libraries with apt-get and then attempting to compile the source code. That, needless to say did not work at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up I tried the suggested method of jhbuild, the package available in the Ubuntu repositories. I just ended up with multiple versions of glib all conflicting with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up I tried building jhbuild from its source. Building jhbuild was pretty simple, and then I tried to bootstrap and compile GTK+. The pain then came that hidden deep within the logs it wasn&amp;#8217;t installing the version of Cairo necessary for Pango, so I attempted to find my way around that which meant I ended up in library hell. It was so damn close though as it was only GTK+ left to build and there was a compilation error because something was missing from Glib to do with emblems &amp;#8211; so close and yet so far. It seems to you need some libraries installed on your system as well as the ones that are constructed as part of jhbuild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I persevered with lots of combinations, time and hard work, and still I didn&amp;#8217;t manage to get it to compile. It&amp;#8217;s a bit depressing to be defeated by a build system, but it seems to have grown so massive and baroque that it is a large barrier to entry. The thing was I really wanted to mess around with one of the git branches of GTK+.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Links To Old Windows</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/09/25/links-to-old-windows.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-09-25T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-09-25:blog/2008/09/25/links-to-old-windows.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/09/24/john-and-kate-plus-windows-98/"&gt;John and Kate Plus Windows 98&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I discovered on these travels is that Qt is much faster to get up and running (with a simpler build system that works more or less straight away) whereas GTK+ is much more difficult to get started with (unless you are using the packages supplied with your distro).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it swings back the other way because with Qt you have less access to the low level functionality or those types of interfaces that are exposed are not quite powerful enough. With GTK+ it certainly seems a bit more configurable in that respect, say for writing a new backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good piece of news about GTK+ is that there is now a native OSX version &lt;a href="http://www.gtk-osx.org/"&gt;GTK+OSX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, an enterprising developer has created a new indirect rendering backend with no reliance on an X-server (very handy for testing and the suchlike) which can be found &lt;a href="http://nanosleep.org/wiki/GTK%2B_Indirect_Renderer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not something like being able to crank out a million lines of code in a year, or to construct the most complex algorithms. Being able to read and comprehend other people&amp;#8217;s code is the most important skill you could need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very rarely do programmers get to work in a bubble where they only have their own code to deal with, and most have to work on a legacy system of some sort. In such an environment you need to be able to understand the code in order to simply fix bugs, let alone being able to evolve and add features to the system and codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also segues nicely into another bugbear of mine, Not-Invented-Here Syndrome. NIH is really a side-effect of being afraid of other people&amp;#8217;s code, but when you have the ability to read a wide variety of code, bug fixing in those external areas isn&amp;#8217;t so frightening. The benefits definitely outweigh the risks of using externally developed code thanks to it typically having many man-years of development being invested in it, leading to a maturity that would be very difficult to reach when starting from scratch (unless the quality was so bad there is no choice). Stand on the shoulders of giants &amp;#8211; it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another nice side-effect is it helps you respect other people&amp;#8217;s perspective. All those things that annoy you about understanding other people&amp;#8217;s code, remember them and filter them out in your own code. It will mean other people can use your code more effectively. Consistent formatting (I don&amp;#8217;t care where stuff goes so long as it is sane and consistent &amp;#8211; things like braces in C/C++), easy debugging, useful documentation, reusable functionality, and easy testing, should always be aimed for when creating code. It&amp;#8217;s even best to think that way in private pieces of code because you never know when it will end up being public.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Random Sunday Links</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/09/07/random-sunday-links.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-09-07T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-09-07:blog/2008/09/07/random-sunday-links.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2008/sep/03/1/"&gt;Django 1.0 released!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Apart from the obvious libraries WebKit and the new Javascript engine V8, there are some more interesting ones. Apparently it uses &lt;a href="http://wtl.sourceforge.net/"&gt;WTL&lt;/a&gt; for the GUI, which was a Microsoft originated GUI toolkit (with lots of excellent extensions) that ended up becoming open-source. It&amp;#8217;s a very good toolkit for windows and developing for it is relatively painless but it is an interesting choice. Also there is Skia which is a vector graphics engine that is used for the rendering, apparently from an acquisition a few years back.&lt;/p&gt;

The most impressive aspect of which was the user interface that mimicked a full desktop application in look and feel. At the time they promised that the framework used for this (written in Javascript) was going to be released under an open-source licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cappuccino.org/discuss/2008/09/04/announcing-cappuccino/"&gt;Objective-J and Cappuccino&lt;/a&gt; have now been released under the LGPL licence. The Cappuccino website is &lt;a href="http://cappuccino.org/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with lots of information and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework itself is really designed for writing proper applications in the web browser like GMail and 280 Slides rather than simply adding interactivity to web pages. Objective-J provides the basis of the &amp;#8220;language&amp;#8221; adding more features to Javascript non-invasively, then Cappuccino is built on top of it and is more or less a port of the GNUStep/Cocoa frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

If you look at 280 Slides it is really impressive and now I have tried it in Firefox 3.0 it is really quite snappy (when I tried it a while back in Firefox 2.0 it was a bit more sluggish). This also becomes even more interesting with the new Javascript advancements being made by various browsers like TraceMonkey (Firefox 3.1), SquirrelFish (Safari 4.0), and &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/apis/v8/"&gt;V8&lt;/a&gt; (Google&amp;#8217;s Chrome).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Link Geek</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/09/02/link-geek.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-09-02T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-09-02:blog/2008/09/02/link-geek.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,2329273,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532"&gt;Download &amp;#8216;Command &amp;amp; Conquer: Red Alert&amp;#8217; for Free&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was writing some code in Python that was essentially a function dispatcher where all the functions have the same arguments. When writing them in a more static language you have to specify all the arguments wherever they are forwarded when what you really want to say is take all the arguments and bung them into the next function. Not really a problem with cut and paste, but when you start changing the function protoype you have to make sure you change it in all the related places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python you have the option of using *args which consumes the rest of the arguments of a function and puts them into a list. This meant that I could define lots of the functions which were just forwarding using *args and then pass them into the function being forwarded to using *args.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;
foo1('yes', True, 100, 3.14, 'hello world')
def foo1(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5):
    foo2(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5)
def foo2(*args):
    foo3(*args)
def foo3(param1, *args):
    print param1
def foo4(param2, param3, param4, param5):
    print '%s %s %s %s' % (param2, param3, param4, param5)
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
foo1() is the long winded way to write it. foo2() just forwards all of the arguments. foo3() takes the first parameter (and prints it) and forwards the four remaining parameters. foo4() finally just prints out the four remaining parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the reason I liked it was it removed the horrific evolution overhead of rapidly developing some code. When I wanted to add/remove/consolidate parameters in the code for a lot of related functions using *args made it much simpler to do. You don&amp;#8217;t have to settle for a little less perfect solution because making a minor adjustment is a large amount of work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Free Software – It’s Spreading</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/08/31/free-software-its-spreading.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-08-31T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-08-31:blog/2008/08/31/free-software-its-spreading.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a good post called &lt;a href="http://blog.ibeentoubuntu.com/2008/08/appliancising-of-free-software.html"&gt;The &amp;#8220;Appliancising&amp;#8221; of Free Software&lt;/a&gt; which talks about how free software is helping to make appliances of computing equipment and the diversification of the &amp;#8220;standard&amp;#8221; software.

It is likely you would start with something like Debian or Gentoo and then customise it for your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even writing commercial software the same thing occurs. I have seen the same product rebranded for not only different markets but for different resellers and agents. Then they all want their own customisations to differentiate from what is essentially the same software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing the same type of thing with Windows is just insane. For a start you can&amp;#8217;t really configure the system without undocumented things and jumping through many hoops, even Media Centers are pretty much equivalent editions possibly with some changed logo graphics with only the hardware providing the differentiating factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also doing the same thing from scratch is brain-damaged. Reinventing the wheel for little or no benefit will just lead to maintenance headaches. As a developer I am fundamentally lazy and will reuse what I can because it is great to stand on the shoulders of giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to this future of diversity because one-size-fits-all doesn&amp;#8217;t work and could supply better to tested and built systems that actually do what they say.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Links For Gits</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/08/31/links-for-gits.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-08-31T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-08-31:blog/2008/08/31/links-for-gits.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS7559902579.html"&gt;Intel acquires OpenedHand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I can see why people like Python so much, it has some cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I discovered this week was the &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-Queue.html"&gt;Queue&lt;/a&gt; object in Python. It is a thread-safe FIFO queue and it is there and ready to use. In C++ I would probably have found the definitive implementation through some library (hopefully in &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org"&gt;Boost&lt;/a&gt;) or I would have to roll my own with all the headaches involved in making sure just the building blocks work correctly. I&amp;#8217;m not using it in the way that most people would expect but that is the great part of supplying solidly tested building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual the code I am writing needed unit-testing to make sure it did what it says on the tin. This meant a multi-threaded unit-test &amp;#8211; I know this is a &lt;a href="http://goodliffe.blogspot.com/2008/06/unit-testing-threads-is-hard-part-4.html"&gt;bad thing sometimes&lt;/a&gt;. I had to thrash it with the mountain of threads but the tests seem to work consistently (although I imagine it could turn up to bite me in the future). I am sure three-quarters of the code I have been writing are unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other great parts of Python I found is the function is a first class object, and I&amp;#8217;ve even played a little with lambdas. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to investigating where the best place is to put the boundaries between C++ and Python code.&lt;/p&gt;

This is not a diatribe about how C++ is rubbish, because I think C++ is great. I am making some &amp;#8220;mistakes&amp;#8221; as I am in the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I was writing a function to parse a URL into the useful parts that make it up. I&amp;#8217;d laid it out all nicely, written some unit-tests and it did its job exactly how I wanted. Then I was asked did the Python &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-urlparse.html"&gt;urlparse&lt;/a&gt; module not do what I wanted. Damn &amp;#8211; as a C++ developer I&amp;#8217;m used to rolling a lot of stuff that make up the building blocks of the software, so what I did was pretty natural. What I need to learn is to check the Python libraries first before doing obvious things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I am rapidly unlearning is writing verbose loops. In C++ I am used to writing loops int he way I am expecting them to be executed. In Python you need to express them differently using list comprehension, which I am liking a lot. I even rewrote some loops today I wrote in my first week where I replaced seven lines with one that expressed the intent of the statement perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that weirded me out was creating threads. You create the variables for them, start them off and they know when to clean themselves up&amp;#8230; I think it is because I am still thinking about the C++ scoping rules rather than garbage collecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure these Python-ing mistakes won&amp;#8217;t be my last, but it is interesting to wrap your head around some new things. I do miss manually managing my memory and knowing when stuff gets destroyed, I think it probably is because I&amp;#8217;m paranoid and need to relax and go with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Links, Quotes, More Links</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/08/18/links-quotes-more-links.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-08-18T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-08-18:blog/2008/08/18/links-quotes-more-links.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/08/17/fr-how-to-avoid-feature-creep-with-your-software-apps/"&gt;F|R: How to Avoid Feature Creep with Your Software Apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noah Coad, one of the Program Managers on the Visual Studio team blogged about &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/noahc/archive/2007/10/10/multi-monitor-support-in-vs10.aspx"&gt;Multi Monitor Support in VS10&lt;/a&gt; and it is confirmed on the &lt;a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=351965"&gt;Microsoft Connect site&lt;/a&gt;. When I worked at &lt;a href="http://displaylink.com"&gt;DisplayLink&lt;/a&gt; we obviously used multiple monitors on Windows in development so any help in that regard is welcomed. When you use multiple monitors every day you do discover the deficiencies in the operation of such set-ups (even on the latest Windows Vista). Things like disappearing windows, incorrect sizing, incorrect windows flags (saying its maximised when it isn&amp;#8217;t leading to all kinds of bizarre effects), losing display configurations, and the most important &amp;#8211; that virtually all Windows applications are designed to be operated when the parent frame is full-screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features that are being suggested should be in the operating system, not just support in certain applications that never even make it into the higher level APIs (how many implementations should there be of ribbon? one provided by the API). These features are also not just the realm of developers, I am sure artists, sound engineers and many other disciplines would like to see better multiple monitor support. Also, when it is in the operating system it is consistent across all applications rather than having similar or completely different behaviour between applications. The main problem with Windows in this regard is if there is a good feature that is applicable to more situations it never propagates up to the API level within the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By operating system I mean graphical user interface &lt;img src='http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Blogging At 70mph</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/08/15/blogging-at-70mph.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-08-15T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-08-15:blog/2008/08/15/blogging-at-70mph.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m in a car travelling at 70mph and I can blog (I&amp;#8217;m not driving &amp;#8211; honest).

Initially it was just me playing around with it with some feedback from others. At some point we decided to use the wiki for internal documentation and Tristan Day took on the mantle of Benevolent Wiki Dictator. Without him the wiki wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been as well organised or useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We put everything on there including Tristan&amp;#8217;s horrific task of porting over old documents that were in various formats like Word or text. When they were online and it was the way they were supposed to be edited they became &amp;#8220;living documents&amp;#8221; that are continually updated. Some areas became repositories of information for what we were currently working on and what was done with some very nice tabe formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also meant the information was available anywhere with an Internet connection and since it was up to and was well presented if anyone had a question we could say &amp;#8220;look at the wiki&amp;#8221;. The wiki pages were even used for management presentations because it clearly showed our project progress and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I do nowadays is whenever I do something and make a note of it, say a development process or carefully constructed command line, I put it in the wiki. I do that rather than having loads of notebooks because they are also useful for other developers, even the noddy stuff. The problem is you do need a housekeeper or Benevolent Wiki Dictator to keep it all well organised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is once you have reached critical mass with the documentation on a wiki then it takes on a life of its own and becomes a communal and extremely important resource. They get even more interesting when you have something like &lt;a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/"&gt;Trac&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.redmine.org/"&gt;Redmine&lt;/a&gt; that integrate bug tracking and source control (and more via plug-ins).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The types of things you should have on a development wiki are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting Up A New Computer &amp;#8211; A well defined process for when you have a new starter that they can follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting Up A Development Environment &amp;#8211; What you need to do to build and run a product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging Information &amp;#8211; How to debug the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding Guidelines &amp;#8211; Which have to be kept up to date making them perfect for a wiki.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Licences &amp;#8211; An audit of licences (like GPL etc) used to achieve a product. It&amp;#8217;s always important to know this information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is tons more but you get the idea of where to start.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Links Will Eat Themselves</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/08/14/links-will-eat-themselves.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-08-14T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-08-14:blog/2008/08/14/links-will-eat-themselves.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computery Stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It doesn&amp;#8217;t seem that the changes were as radical as everyone was expecting as it was mentioned that there was a new object model being designed (I seem to remember &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/11/opengl-future-looks-rosey.html"&gt;blogging about it&lt;/a&gt; nearly two years ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the proposed specification from the &lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/article/vol004_1/"&gt;OpenGL Pipeline Newsletter 004&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently certain developers are furious about it with some very long and vitriolic discussions. If you really want to inflict them on your brain you can see them &lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;amp;Number=243195&amp;amp;Main=45784#Post243195"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;amp;Number=243193#Post243193"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=504547&amp;amp;PageSize=25&amp;amp;WhichPage=1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It seems the games developers are making the CAD industry scapegoats for any of the problems with the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not be the radical change but it is at least incremental, and provides a basis to deprecate and add some functionality. I still like the simplicity of using OpenGL, but then again I was never trying out any of the cutting edge features available on the graphics cards. OpenGL and OpenGL|ES are still being used on the Mac, Linux/Unix derivatives, Nintendo (DS and Wii), Playstation, and the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

The one I coined during the talk was one of my pet peeves which is Tickbox-Driven Design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickbox-Driven Design is a close relation of Marketing-Driven Design, it is driven by market conditions and the competitors that you have. It involves having to tick off features that are &amp;#8220;essential&amp;#8221; to be able to sell (in the perception of marketing/sales), they don&amp;#8217;t have to be good, or even complete, but they have to be there yesterday. If a competitor has a certain feature it simply has to be implemented by even diverting resources. These features tend to be poorly specified and probably don&amp;#8217;t even address the underlying requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When tickbox driven design takes over you are constantly playing catch-up and not innovating, and the longer it goes on the harder it becomes to break the cycle. It normally suggests that the problem can&amp;#8217;t be solved by development alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the development tends to be rushed, poorly specified, and pointless (not the greatest motivating factor when you are the person attempting the implementation) the overhead of maintenance becomes much greater than expected. It can also severely affect morale because you constantly have the perception that your product is no good and behind the curve, when in reality it isn&amp;#8217;t always a lost cause.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>There is no link</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/08/10/there-is-no-link.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-08-10T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-08-10:blog/2008/08/10/there-is-no-link.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Advice on how to present your start-up and the rules of thumb that can help. I like the concise and quick demo, if you can&amp;#8217;t get the idea across quickly then it is most likely all is lost. My favourite one also works well in creative writing as well, &amp;#8220;leave them wanting more&amp;#8221;, people try to cover everything but it is always good to not show all your cards leaving even more room to impress. This is a well thought out article that also touches on the best practices on presentation skills.&lt;/p&gt;

This year it is from the 12th to 14th of September and it only costs £75 for all three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am using Python every day I think maybe I should attend this year. Looking at the talks that are going on it should be an extremely interesting conference. For a start they have &lt;a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/"&gt;Mark Shuttleworth&lt;/a&gt; (of Canonical/Ubuntu fame) and &lt;a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/"&gt;Ted Leung&lt;/a&gt; to deliver the keynotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the talks scheduled are the tutorials one Friday which include PyQt4, Django, and Google App Engine. The Django talk will be hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.jacobian.org/"&gt;Jacob Kaplan-Moss&lt;/a&gt; who is one of the benevolent dictators of the project (and creator) and he will be outlining version 1.0 (due in September).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accepted talks can all be viewed &lt;a href="http://www.pyconuk.org/talk_abstracts.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It certainly looks like there is a lot of variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/"&gt;Julian Todd&lt;/a&gt; did a talk on &lt;a href="http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/"&gt;Public Whip&lt;/a&gt; and I believe an impromptu one on CAM development.

&lt;p&gt;It was hosted at the &lt;a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/"&gt;Sanger Institute&lt;/a&gt; which is part of the very impressive Wellcome Trust Genome Campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Chip With Potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To be honest this talk was over my head but it was about a new way of testing blood at a much lower cost than traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panic-Driven Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was an interactive session, where ideas from the crowd got divided into Test-Driven Development and Panic-Driven Development. It did get sidetracked for a while when exploring the deficiencies of TDD, but it was much more fun to go into where development goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SWIFT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Currently the Wellcome Trust use a proprietary system for genome analysis which has a number of shortcomings. So they embarked on a new system that is open-source and written in C++ to be as performant as possible. It sounds like it is a good step forward with such a large contribution in an industry that tries to be very secretive as to its methods. Sounds like it will save money and time when it is online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Too Much Information For Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Related tot he previous talk, this one talks about the output. The system currently used generates 11,000 PNG and text files for each run bearing in mind there are numerous simultaneous runs. You are ending up with 320Tb of data to sift through. This talk was a story of attempting to parse porrly formed data that people may not even want to look at. Then when the SWIFT system comes online most of this intermediate information will not be generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking About talks.cam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://talks.cam.ac.uk/"&gt;talks.cam&lt;/a&gt; is a website that aggregates the talks happening in Cambridge, both for the University and in general. This looks like a very useful resource. Some of the talk went into plans for the future including trying more integration with social networking for education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wireless Epidemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was a talk from an academic paper looking into the propogation of data using only wireless devices. Basically the devices become routers and forward packets when they have the ability to do so due to proximity. Part of this was a study into the movement of data within a group rather than a completely random pattern as most of the simulations have used in the past. I think &lt;a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2005/paper-HuiCha.pdf"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is a related paper to do with pocket-switched networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis Workflows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Using Rakefiles (Ruby Makefiles) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coda Demo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A demonstration of &lt;a href="http://www.camvine.com"&gt;Camvine&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s Coda system for digital content delivery (that I am now working on). This talk went really well and we let the attendees have access to the screens for the rest of the day which meant we had &amp;#8220;about&amp;#8221; screens for the talks from this point on. It even had my Feedburner API interface page to who the number of readers, unfortunately my blog showed zero subscribers &lt;img src='http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cloud And The Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Attempting to bring the community interaction online like Neighbourhood Watch. Unfortunately the take-up hasn&amp;#8217;t been too high possibly because of the technical ability of the members of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embedded Can Do The Internet Too&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was a really good talk about small computers that are used as microcontrollers. They can even support a webserver. Some of the applications were power monitoring and supplying the information via a webpage. Simon can sum it up better on his blog &lt;a href="http://mookstar.wordpress.com/2008/08/08/barcamb-2-embedded-can-do-the-internet-too/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Bjork Has Done For Us (Tangible User Interfaces On The Cheap)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Since swishy multi-touch is all the rage, this talk was about hacking up a tangible UI for musical purposes (or chemistry purposes for laying out molecules). You can hack up the UIs using &lt;a href="http://reactable.iua.upf.edu/?software"&gt;reacTIVision&lt;/a&gt; which is open-source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed Version Control With Git (Panel)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was unfortunately the weakest talk of the day, but I think that happens when you choose a fashionable topic with a fashionable solution. I actually started daydreaming because I forgot to go on a rant about my merging problems of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also remember the talk about superimposing the government&amp;#8217;s statistical data onto Google Maps (unfortunately I forgot to write down the title) which was an excellent talk. It was interesting to see coloured maps of people&amp;#8217;s age ranges in the UK. Unfortunately the developer had to jump through a number of API and data hoops just to get what should be freely available Google Maps information (like polygon areas of the counties or parishes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it was a great day with a very high quality of talks and I am looking forward to next year&amp;#8217;s.  &lt;/p&gt;

In Lost there was a brief glimpse of a comic from the 1950s. Some people got hold of it and have scanned it in and analysed it in the context of Lost. But I love Golden Age comics and the scans are fantastic. The creator credits can be read &lt;a href="http://tcj.com/messboard/viewtopic.php?t=4449&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;postdays=0&amp;amp;postorder=asc&amp;amp;highlight=mystery+tales"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and it features Steve Ditko&amp;#8217;s first ever work for Marvel (or Atlas as it was known then).&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously you have things like ediff3 in emacs and erm&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One that I used extensively on Windows (also available for Linux) is &lt;a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/"&gt;KDiff3&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a great graphical merge tool, and it works on the Mac. I followed the instructions to integrate it into Git (check out the useful &lt;a href="http://notch8.com/articles/2008/06/06/kdiff3-git-win"&gt;post here&lt;/a&gt;) but I haven&amp;#8217;t had the mergetool successfully fire it up. When I load the files manually it seems to work fine. It&amp;#8217;ll require some more perseverance. KDiff3 is a great tool though and is a pleasure to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to also look at &lt;a href="http://meld.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Meld&lt;/a&gt; through MacPorts. Unfortunately it has to pull in half the universe like a gravity well, so it was still compiling the dependencies when I decided to call it a day. It looks like a good tool though with all the features you would want, but will no doubt need to run on the X11 platform. Also it is regularly updated which is a good sign. So if I can get it to work expect a post about that&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FileMerge built into the Mac is only a two way tool, and I did consider the Perform Merge Tool which is available for free.

&lt;p&gt;Having unit testing built into the language (or at least the standard library) is a good move. With an interpreted language like Python it is invaluable to test the various code paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also helped me find some obvious bugs in my code, which I probably shouldn&amp;#8217;t say in public, entirely because it is embarrassing. That is the first obvious benefit of unit testing. The next benefit is more subtle, you discover how to structure your code in a better fashion because you are thinking about how to test the individual parts of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit testing is another option instead of the code checkers PyLint, etc, because the code paths are exercised providing you have written the test. Not perfect, but better than not doing code checking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scary thing is you end up with much more testing code than actual executable code. I remember reading somewhere that if that is the case then you are doing something right(!)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The House Of Flying Links</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/29/the-house-of-flying-links.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-29T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-29:blog/2008/07/29/the-house-of-flying-links.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.1/"&gt;KDE 4.1 Released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

That isn&amp;#8217;t anything special in the grand scheme of things (especially to a programmer), but they emphasized something interesting, that they would be kept separate brands like they are separate entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This never ever happens after a takeover/merger. Promises are made that you will be kept a separate operating entity but as soon as the deal is done all bets are off. Even if it does happen in the short term in the medium term you can guarantee that the job-churning in the board room will mean that previous policies get overturned. Bear in mind the &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-02-10-departing-ceos-usat_x.htm"&gt;average CEO tenure is five years&lt;/a&gt;, and that study is three years old, so imagine it is even less now (since the average was 9.5 years in 1992 and 7 in 2001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you are ever in a takeover, be aware that unless it is written down and so expensive to get out of that they would never go back on it, it&amp;#8217;s unlikely to turn out the way you would imagine.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Debugging In Python – Dilemma #2</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/28/debugging-in-python-dilemma-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-28T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-28:blog/2008/07/28/debugging-in-python-dilemma-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The next stage in Python development is &amp;#8220;how do I debug&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m at the stage where I keep adding print statements into the code to spot code flows and inspect values (which is nice because you can print more or less anything). But this is an extremely archaic way of approaching it, especially in this day and age&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently there is a &lt;a href="http://www.ferg.org/papers/debugging_in_python.html"&gt;PDB module&lt;/a&gt; (there is another nice article &lt;a href="http://www.onlamp.com/lpt/a/6163"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) but it seems to require code changes (an import and where you want to break), not a great deal of fun, especially if you accidentally leave some of this code in. It&amp;#8217;s quite odd that it is not immediately apparent how to have breakpoints or to inspect data values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, because there is a lack of a sanity checker by default you have to run your code and exercise the code paths to test your code. The good thing is that there are a number of programs to help with that, &lt;a href="http://www.logilab.org/857"&gt;PyLint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/"&gt;PyChecker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes"&gt;PyFlakes&lt;/a&gt;, so it is not much of a worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyDev has an interactive &lt;a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/debug.html"&gt;debugger&lt;/a&gt; so this will require much more investigation because it also can integrate PyLint for some error checking.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Par 3 On The Links</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/28/par-3-on-the-links.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-28T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-28:blog/2008/07/28/par-3-on-the-links.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.barcamp.org/BarCamb-2"&gt;Bar-Camb 2 is this Friday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now having to do development in Python on a Mac (personal choice), and this leaves me with a variety of dilemmas. For a start I have never coded in anger on Python but it seems fairly easy to grok and pick up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first dilemma is what do I edit my files in&amp;#8230; I have played around with four choices so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was my first port of call because I have used it before. It also has the plug-in &lt;a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/"&gt;PyDev&lt;/a&gt; which provides autocomplete and other niceties beyond syntax highlighting. I have ony begun to scratch the surface of the system, mainly because there is so much and it is presented right from the start rather than starting simple then gradually adding features. Since I was only evaluating I chose the free version of PyDev but it started popping up regular dialogs to remind me there is a paying version which kind of annoyed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://smultron.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Smultron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A nice and simple text editor which provides syntax highlighting for Python (although it doesn&amp;#8217;t get the three double-quote comments correct). I like it, but you have to open the files in order to edit them rather than having an interface onto the file system to speed up the process. You can create a project to simplify it, but it requires some upfront work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://macromates.com/"&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The de-facto standard for editing files on the Mac. The feature I like the most is the project side tray. Drop a folder onto it and you can access the file system for that folder to your hearts content which is really helpful when traversing lots of files. It is also very configurable but I don&amp;#8217;t think I have even scratched the surface yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aquamacs.org/"&gt;Aquamacs Emacs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Certain people I have had the pleasure of working with in my career are part of the elite Emacs Users Group, it is a top secret organisation based on open-source where with a few touches of a keyboard they can probably bring about some kind of world-spanning event. Aquamacs is the best Mac version of the editor I found and I have been playing with a small amount. For an emacs it does not look out of place on the Apple desktop, and it is obviously still the most configurable tool on the planet. If I can get myself up and running on this I reckon it will probably be a contender. Also, version 1.4 has just been released.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Let Them Eat Links</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/27/let-them-eat-links.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-27T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-27:blog/2008/07/27/let-them-eat-links.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/"&gt;Bletchley Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you want is a mobile phone that is simple and clear to use. Unfortunately those beasts do not exist. On the &lt;a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/"&gt;RNIB&lt;/a&gt; website you can go to their shop and see the &lt;a href="http://onlineshop.rnib.org.uk/browse.asp?n=11&amp;amp;c=59&amp;amp;sc=0&amp;amp;it=1&amp;amp;l=2"&gt;few available&lt;/a&gt;. They are not of the quality you usually see in mass produced phones, but they are expensive in the grand scheme of things (obviously missing out on economies of scale and not being made by the large players in the mobile market).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was looking I looked at all the major manufacturer websites for options that are more accessible and they did have pages on their site suggesting the best models for it. Unfortunately those models were typically so old they were discontinued, and every model that was suggested was totally unsuitable. I think also when people think of the blind they think of complete visual loss which is actually more rare than being visually impaired enough to be registered blind, so large and clear items can work for the blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end out of the options the &lt;a href="http://www.emporialifeplus.com/"&gt;Emporia Life Plus&lt;/a&gt; was the least bad option. The buttons and display are fairly large and clear, definitely much more so than every mainstream phone handset. The phone is actually designed for the elderly with a bright red button on the back to hit in case of emergencies, so its applicability for someone with visual impairment is only a side-effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a failure of simple user interface design. Part of the reason I steered clear of mobile phones for several years is that as they added more features to their checklist, those features weren&amp;#8217;t very nice to use. Actually I just found an &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/index.html"&gt;iPhone page for accessibility&lt;/a&gt; which is a start. I suppose some people are not too sure because of the lack of tactile feedback so I suppose this is where audio feedback becomes very important and where someone able to set it up in the best way possible comes in. There is also a &lt;a href="http://images.apple.com/accessibility/pdf/iPhone_3G_vpat.pdf"&gt;pdf with more iPhone details&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a look at the &lt;a href="http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_Nokia_Launches_N82_Smartphone_For_Visually_Impaired_13350.html"&gt;Nokia N82 smartphone&lt;/a&gt; and just from the image you can see the buttons are completely unsuitable. It&amp;#8217;s principal technology is that it scans and reads documents for the blind (and email, etc) which is all well and good but the complete package doesn&amp;#8217;t address every need. It&amp;#8217;s a gadget to help the completely blind in general rather than allowing the visually impaired to make good use of their mobile phone (or as it is nowadays a mobile computer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be very interesting for a study on how to improve interfaces for visual impairment because if nothing happens and more goes mobile/online you end up with a surprising number of people left out of the loop. Even a study of the audio, tactile and visual elements would be an enlightening proposition to help take a step forward in understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Link Dump 23/7</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/23/link-dump-237.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-23T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-23:blog/2008/07/23/link-dump-237.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some more interesting links from the net of the inter.&lt;/p&gt;

The lecture being about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Doctorow on Life in the Information Economy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a bet, some decades ago, that the information economy would be based on buying and selling (and hence restricting copying of) information. We were totally, 100 percent wrong, and now the world’s in turmoil because of it. What does a copy-native economy look like? How do everyone from barbers to musicians become richer, more fulfilled and more civilly engaged in a real information society. And what do we do about the fact that a couple of dinosauric entertainment companies are determined to screw it up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cory Doctorow is a blogger, science fiction writer and journalist. He is an editor of Boing Boing, the 11th best blog in the world (according to Time Magazine). He was the 2006-2007 Canadian Fulbright Chair in Public Diplomacy at the USC Center on Public Diplomacy. He founded the software company Opencola which was later sold to the Open Text Corporation. He also writes regularly for The Guardian newspaper &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can say is &amp;#8220;Wow&amp;#8221;. I&amp;#8217;ve never heard anyone speak so fast for so long with so much content. In an hour he covered DRM, three strikes and your out, criminalisation of the customer, and much more. He concentrated also on the strengths of the Internet and not fighting against them one of which being the ability to form strong groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is that he offers solutions not just problems, even his own content he generates, blogs, lectures, books, graphic novels, is available under Creative Commons. In the question and answers session he provide excellent answers, especially about software developers in this brave new world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was so much content that I think it is going to take a few days for my brain to process it all&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

It provides a UI for developing iPhone applications that run in MobileSafari that look the same as native iPhone applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Navigational Menus and iPhone interfaces from standard HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use or knowledge of JavaScript is not required to create basic iPhone pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to handle phone orientation changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a more &amp;#8220;iPhone-like&amp;#8221; experience to Web apps (on or off the iPhone).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great introduction blog post from Hoe Hewitt &lt;a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/introducing_iui.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The library provides all the building blocks to get started quickly with some spiffing looking iPhone specific webpages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is about delivering digital information to network connected displays with the flagship product being &lt;a href="http://camvine.com/products/coda"&gt;CODA&lt;/a&gt;. You have CODAlinks which allows you to connect a display to the network. You have the CODAbox which sends data to lots of CODAlinks and lives on the local network. The final piece is the CODA website where you configure the content you want on the screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of this system is that it is better value than similar systems, and you can expand easily with additional CODAlinks. One major feature is that it is nowhere near as power hungry as equivalent systems which is always a good thing. It is simple to set-up, manage and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if anyone knows a good &lt;a href="http://camvine.com/opportunities/smdir1"&gt;Marketing &amp;amp; Sales Director&lt;/a&gt;, there is a vacancy going&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Tablet PCs And The Multi-Touch Future</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/18/tablet-pcs-and-the-multi-touch-future.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-18T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-18:blog/2008/07/18/tablet-pcs-and-the-multi-touch-future.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past six months I have actually got to use some tablet PCs, and I wonder why any company pursues that market unless it is seriously high margins. For a start the power of these computers are some way off the cutting edge both by processor and graphically. Also the build quality is not good with cheap flimsy plastic made to feel even more unstable thanks to a swivelling monitor so it can be a normal laptop as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really gets me about tablet PCs is the software. I have tried both Windows XP Tablet PC Edition and Windows Vista which has integrated the functionality into the core system (I guess for certain levels of Vista). Additional functionality is provided by the driver software in order to make it easier to use. This is my main gripe, the entire GUI system is predicated around &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)"&gt;WIMP&lt;/a&gt; and specifically the way that has been set in stone by Windows. The problem is that the pen then becomes basically a pressure sensitive mouse which makes it more difficult and more work to do basic things like resize windows or the horrific right-click if there is a button on the pen. In addition there is normally a trackpad or mouse pointer mechanism built into the computer because it has not fully embraced the tablet way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drivers that the hardware suppliers give try to get around problems like multiple selection (in this instance there is a tick box next to every item in Explorer), and try to make it a bit easier. Unfortunately, because this is not integrated with the core system it is not perfect and needs to deal with unexpected system changes, say for instance plugging in an external display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tablet PCs do thrive in environments with a very focussed use where a custom UI is constructed that provides the correct interaction mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this article &lt;a href="http://uk.gizmodo.com/2008/07/18/the_mouse_is_for_the_scrapheap.html"&gt;The Mouse Is For The Scrapheap&lt;/a&gt; this morning and thought they are a bit hopeful. They are really talking about other interaction mechanisms for specific tasks, not for general computing. This is entirely down to the GUI provided in the operating system, it is not designed for any other way of interacting. Microsoft want &lt;a href="http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2008/05/27/microsoft-demonstrates-multi-touch.aspx"&gt;multi-touch at the centre of Windows 7&lt;/a&gt;, but unless the user interface changes substantially it will be a half-hearted solution. The demonstrations centred around demonstration applications that could use it rather than the framework for the entire GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would the problem be solved? You would start with the multi-touch implementation and a blank screen. Then create a window that allows for the interactions user&amp;#8217;s expect such as resizing, moving, minimising, etc. This would have to work for the hand driven multitouch in a quick and painless fashion because current window implementations would be too fiddly, but you may find some common ground that can be used in the prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily Apple had a chance for a clean break with the iPhone/iTouch and designed the user interface in a pared down fashion that works for even my fat fingers. This was done by working on a Cocoa Touch API where it is the basis of the interactions the user has, and the main system applications provide a roadmap for the GUI design.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Interesting Articles Today 18/7</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/18/interesting-articles-today-187.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-18T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-18:blog/2008/07/18/interesting-articles-today-187.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some interesting links&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s a very long-winded approach to surfing the Internet that requires knowing what was there before and aso visting sites that have no updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this blog I made sure I had an RSS feed, but rarely used them myself apart from tracking bug reporting system issues and wiki changes&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I decided to set up &lt;a href="http://google.com/reader"&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; with the websites I usually frequent.

Now I can keep track of what I have and haven&amp;#8217;t read, but now I need to remember to bookmark the interesting articles.&lt;/p&gt;

I played Grand Theft Auto 4 on the X-Box 360 and realised the controller was useless, you had shoulder buttons, shoulder analogue buttons, a direction pad, plenty of buttons, an analogue stick, and buttons in the centre. They are also all laid out for people whose hands and fingers are a certain size. The PS3 is just as guilty with loads of controls and not much design progression from previous generations, I really struggled with first person shooters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem really is that these controllers are trying to solve all eventualities and not sticking to the &amp;#8220;less is more&amp;#8221; convention. When you are what is defined as a hardcore gamer you are used to it and can&amp;#8217;t understand why anyone can&amp;#8217;t pick these controllers up and use them easily. Also games try to use every button because they are there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I see it in the future is that most games will come with their own controllers. This has a two fold effect, firstly the controller represents the way that you want the user to interact with the game and clearly defines the user experience. Secondly, the controller becomes part of the package you are buying, so you are not getting just software which is a way of rhaving an incentive to actually buy the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nintendo Wii gets so much of this right. The controllers are simple and intuitive and encourage &amp;#8220;casual&amp;#8221; play because you don&amp;#8217;t have to re-wire your brain for a quick play. Also the controllers are multi-paradigm with more than one component, you can use it as a SNES-like controller, you can use an analogue stick, you can use the accelerometers. The other part of this is that the controllers &amp;#8220;dock&amp;#8221;, for instance Mario Kart has a steering wheel you put the Wii controller inside, as does Guitar Her and its ilk. This also dramatically reduces the cost of manufacturing a custom controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite controller is &lt;a href="http://www.xgaming.com/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; though&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>WordPress – 2.6 Released</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/15/wordpress-26-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-15T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-15:blog/2008/07/15/wordpress-26-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I only started using &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; last week and I have been completely in awe of its features and how much it is a step forward from Blogger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a bit of a fan of static analysis, having posted quite a few times on my previous blog about Lint. Lint is much more comprehensive than the new one out of the Clang project but then again this is much younger and free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment the tool analyses C and Objective-C with rules to find problems with memory allocation patterns. It looks like the tool will be actively maintained as it will also be used inside of Apple. The HTML reports it generates are easy to use and read which is always a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few posts about this analyser out there on the Internet. There are blog posts about using it &lt;a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/blog/2008/07/07/new-tool-on-the-block-the-llvmclang-static-analyzer/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2008/07/14/the-clang-static-analyzer/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly the &lt;a href="http://www.adiumx.com/"&gt;Adium X&lt;/a&gt; (instant messaging client) have started to use the tool and have discovered a few problems. The results of the analysis are &lt;a href="http://trac.adiumx.com/wiki/StaticAnalysis"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (although there is some kind of server error at the moment so you can see it in the Google Cache &lt;a href="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:5K2wbL2DVJEJ:trac.adiumx.com/wiki/StaticAnalysis+clang+static+analysis&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;cd=12&amp;amp;gl=uk&amp;amp;client=firefox-a"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>New Hosting – Clook</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/14/new-hosting-clook.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-14T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-14:blog/2008/07/14/new-hosting-clook.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use WordPress for my blog, hence abandoning Blogspot, but I needed to find a hosting service that would allow me to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did lots of searching and decided to steer well clear of the cheap&amp;#8217;n'cheerful hosts because I could read too many horror stories about them. Also, I wanted a UK host so support is on the same time zone as my existence as I am one of the strange computer types who doesn&amp;#8217;t work on nocturnal hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much searching I found a smaller company called &lt;a href="http://www.clook.co.uk/"&gt;Clook&lt;/a&gt; which had some good reviews mainly about the service. I bit the bullet and got the shared server package which was reasonably priced (£50 + VAT for the year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has really impressed me about them is how good their service is. When you have a problem they are quick and responsive and have a real grasp of how to actually fix things. They even helped me sort out the dead-brained error I had made installing WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hosting provides all the features you could want when setting up a website with &lt;a href="http://www.cpanel.net/index.html"&gt;cPanel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastico_(web_hosting)"&gt;Fantastico&lt;/a&gt;. You have the usual suspects running on Linux, Python, PHP, Perl, MySQL, and you can probably request some custom work if necessary. You also get backups and cron jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to sum up &lt;a href="http://www.clook.co.uk/"&gt;Clook&lt;/a&gt;, they have reasonable prices, excellent service, and provide some compelling features.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Firefox 3 On The Mac</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/14/firefox-3-on-the-mac.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-14T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-14:blog/2008/07/14/firefox-3-on-the-mac.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://getfirefox.com"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; is my browser of choice on the Mac mainly because I can&amp;#8217;t live without my Add-Ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make Firefox more Mac-like I recommend the two following Add-Ons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.takebacktheweb.org/"&gt;GrApple Deicious (Blue)&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Is a theme for Firefox that makes it look very close to Safari. Simply it looks like a Mac application so you never feel you are using an alien environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1951"&gt;Fission&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; This changes the progress bar for loading pages. It changes the look so that the progress is shown in the address bar, which means you can switch off the status bar for an even more Mac-like experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just those two Add-Ons give Firefox 3 a real boost on the Mac (how shallow &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s the surface experience). In Firefox 3 there have been more changes under the bonnet for better Mac integration with native-look widgets and improved rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not just on Mac the situation is improved, I have been using it on Windows Vista and to sum it up, Firefox 3 is blazingly fast and looks really quite good. The best feature is the improved speed of Javascript which really makes scripting-heavy websites a pleasure to use and you don&amp;#8217;t seem to get the multiple tabs hanging when something complex is trying to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node&amp;amp;id=0&amp;amp;t=321"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Foxkeh" title="Foxkeh" src="http://images.spreadfirefox.com/affiliates/Buttons/firefox3/foxkeh-fx3-180x60.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Fostering Innovation</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/13/fostering-innovation.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-13T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-13:blog/2008/07/13/fostering-innovation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A difficulty with any company is keeping up that spirit of innovation when it is established. Different companies approach is in different ways or even not at all, so it is always interesting to hear how they approach it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite articles of recent times (which inspired the title of this post) is &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/04/17/pixars-brad-bird-on-fostering-innovation/"&gt;Pixar&amp;#8217;s Brad Bird on Fostering Innovation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great quote from Steve Jobs in the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs told him: “The only thing we’re afraid of is complacency—feeling like we have it all figured out,” Bird quotes his boss as saying “…We want you to come shake things up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Bird provides nine lessons, which although are for a creative animation company, are generally applicable. My favourite one is the first lesson, &amp;#8220;Herd your black sheep&amp;#8221;, which involves finding the artists with ideas for making things better, and allowing them to express their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in the world of computer development the lesson &amp;#8220;Perfect is the Enemy of Innovation&amp;#8221; is important, because the quest for perfect perfection takes your eyes off the ball of actually delivering something. Other ideas from the article is to discuss publicly within a team to interconnect everyone&amp;#8217;s strengths, and high morale makes creativity (and by that token productivity) cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t try to protect your success&amp;#8221; is not immediately obvious, but I guess simply trading one-upmanship with a competitor doesn&amp;#8217;t give you any innovation. &amp;#8220;Interaction = Innovation&amp;#8221;, is another about communication by encouraging not just team communication but interdisciplinary communication, people should not be cordoned off in their own little world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/static.py?page=about.html&amp;amp;about=eng"&gt;Google 20% time&lt;/a&gt; is the obvious example of attempting to foster innovation. Projects such as GMail, Google News, &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/"&gt;MacFUSE&lt;/a&gt; grew out of it. It is certainly one of the most talked about aspects of having a job at Google. Recently there have been rumours from places like Valleywag saying that 20% time is being cracked down on with areas like &amp;#8220;Google Mail Labs&amp;#8221; being started to give developers a sandbox for which to experiment with rather than having carte blanche. I think certainly more experienced developers probably find it easier to get more out-of-the-box ideas okayed though, but then again that doesn&amp;#8217;t make such linkable headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach to this was used by Disney&amp;#8217;s Black Rock Studios. They hosted a Minigame Week which was outlined in a two part interview with &lt;a href="http://www.developmag.com"&gt;Develop Magazine&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://www.developmag.com/interviews/133/Mickey-and-Minigames-Part-1"&gt;part one here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.developmag.com/interviews/132/Mickey-and-Minigames-Part-2"&gt;part two here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea within the studio was to spend some time being creative and make a minigame in a week as a team building exercise. This involved the entire company of about 120 people. An interesting part was that it allowed people who don&amp;#8217;t traditionally work together to do so, and they also found leaders that they did not know about before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the interview contains a developer&amp;#8217;s diary of the week&amp;#8217;s work. Rather scarily it ends in the crescendo on Friday afternoon presentations which must be nerve-racking to get the demo to work in a week&amp;#8230; It sounds like it was hard work but sometimes these things don&amp;#8217;t tire you out and invigorate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to conferences/conventions are those kind of invigorating events and I wish I could bottle that feeling. You talk to lots of people get loads of ideas then the feeling gradually dissipates over the following weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think all of this is more about the people rather than the end product. It has to be kept going even through the difficult times because it is part of the company culture and the moment it stops the goodwill dissipates quickly. These companies have found ways to do it right and I think any application of the the same ideals needs to be tailored for what the company is trying to achieve, hence the minigame for games companies.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Enthusiasm About Technology – iPhone 2.0</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/13/enthusiasm-about-technology-iphone-20.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-13T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-13:blog/2008/07/13/enthusiasm-about-technology-iphone-20.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I did start to write a post about my enthusiasm for technology, and more specifically how using Macs and the iPhone has been generally a pleasure. Then I suffered from the &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/07/11/apple_releases_iphone_and_ipod_touch_software_2_0_see_warning.html"&gt;iBrick upgrade&lt;/a&gt; for my iPhone and got all depressed&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After persevering for several attempts, the upgrade took, and then all of the frustrations melted away. This upgrade adds massive value to the iPhone hardware I got last October. It&amp;#8217;s not often you can say this about a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the features I discovered this weekend whilst taking photos at the &lt;a href="http://www.chelmsfordbeerfestival.org.uk/"&gt;Chelmsford Beer Festival&lt;/a&gt; was geotagging. Now I know where I took photos which was particularly useful for documenting how someone had crashed their Subaru on a straight bit of road and wedged itself between a fence and a bollard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reason I was so looking forward to the upgrade was getting my hands on some of the applications now available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up I got Super Monkey Ball which I suck at. It&amp;#8217;s got amazing graphics and the right controller experience using the accelerometers, but I am useless at it. It&amp;#8217;s definitely the big name game of the initial line-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly I got a puzzler called Trism which is a nice and sedate game. I find it a pick up and play type game, so I can have a quick blast when I have a few spare minutes. Also, it is possible to pretend playing puzzle games improves your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Super Monkey Ball may be the big name, but the best game out for the iPhone is Bejeweled. The controls work perfectly on the touch screen whether you are a double-tap or dragging player. Given the size of the images you&amp;#8217;d expect to make lots of mistakes, but it is perfect, I have not hit a single wrong gem. The music is good and the graphics look as good as running on a desktop machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have noticed is now I have played some games the battery will get chomped through a lot faster than when I was only listening to music or leaving it in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>This Blog Has Moved To http://blog.programmerslog.com</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/10/this-blog-has-moved-to.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-10T19:08:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-10:blog/2008/07/10/this-blog-has-moved-to.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This blog has now moved to &lt;a href="http://blog.programmerslog.com/"&gt;Programmer's Log&lt;/a&gt; at its own domain using Wordpress.

I thought I&amp;#8217;d highlight a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/"&gt;Google C++ Testing Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Google&amp;#8217;s framework for writing C++ tests on a variety of platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Windows CE, and Symbian). Based on the xUnit architecture. Supports automatic test discovery, a rich set of assertions, user-defined assertions, death tests, fatal and non-fatal failures, various options for running the tests, and XML test report generation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of C++ unit testing frameworks out there. A good article navigating the minefield can be read &lt;a href="http://www.gamesfromwithin.com/articles/0412/000061.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Advantages of the this framework is mainly it is backed by Google, it is mature, supplies a lot of functionality, and that it is portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/"&gt;Protocol Buffers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Protocol buffers are Google&amp;#8217;s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages – Java, C++, or Python.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are obviously loads of ways to serialise data, but it seems to support a number of languages and is space efficient (at least in comparison to XML). I&amp;#8217;m not too sure how much it would offer over JSON although this does mean you don&amp;#8217;t have to write or find some of the code yourself in the various languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/ratproxy/"&gt;Ratproxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*A semi-automated, largely passive web application security audit tool, optimized for an accurate and sensitive detection, and automatic annotation, of potential problems and security-relevant design patterns based on the observation of existing, user-initiated traffic in complex web 2.0 environments. Detects and prioritizes broad classes of security problems, such as dynamic cross-site trust model considerations, script inclusion issues, content serving problems, insufficient XSRF and XSS defenses, and much more. *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mainly included this because I like the name&amp;#8230; But it is also a useful tool for discovering weaknesses in your website&amp;#8217;s security. I&amp;#8217;ve read about commercial apps that do this but not too many open-source ones, so this release from Google can only be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some other quick ones:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/dom-checker/"&gt;Browser DOM Checker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*A simple utility to thoroughly validate DOM, XMLHttpRequest, and cookie security restriction handling in modern web browsers. Notable features include exhaustive hierarchy crawling, cross-domain IPC system for blind write verification, page transition checks, and more. *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/bunny-the-fuzzer/"&gt;Bunny the Fuzzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*A closed loop, high-performance, general purpose protocol-blind fuzzer for C programs. Uses compiler-level integration to seamlessly inject precise and reliable instrumentation hooks into the traced program. These hooks enable the fuzzer to receive real-time feedback on changes to the function call path, call parameters, and return values in response to variations in input data. This architecture makes it possible to significantly improve the coverage of the testing process without a noticeable performance impact usually associated with other attempts to peek into run-time internals. *&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>TortoiseSVN Visual Studio Integration</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/07/09/tortoisesvn-visual-studio-integration.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-09T19:08:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-07-09:blog/2008/07/09/tortoisesvn-visual-studio-integration.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I developed this Visual Studio integration whilst migrating a previous company (NC Graphics) from Visual SourceSafe to the brave new world of &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt;.  Developing is a bit of a strong word since it is only a settings file for Visual Studio, but it does the job admirably in a non-intrusive way and has no performance effects at all on the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settings file gives you a new toolbar, a new menu, and new items on the context menus in the solution view.  You get some nice &lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/"&gt;TortoiseSVN&lt;/a&gt; standard icons to make it even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all works with Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 (and even the Express Editions), along with a standard installation of TortoiseSVN.  Unless you want to edit the commandline in the External Tools I recommend installing TortoiseSVN to the default location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s quick to set up, just go to your &amp;#8220;Tools&amp;#8221; menu and choose &amp;#8220;Import and Export Settings&amp;#8221; and follow the instructions. Ensure the tick box for which settings to import are all ticked.  If the settings don&amp;#8217;t work first time, try again, as Visual Studio can be a bit flaky when loading.  It will replace your External Tools because they have to be stored in the correct numbered slot due to the way they are implemented in Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately renaming is well beyond the external tools implementation I have used.  TortoiseSVN 1.5 does have some additional functionality to rebuild the links for renamed files which is really useful.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;strong&gt;Supported TortoiseSVN operations&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    The following Subversion/TortoiseSVN features are covered in the integration:
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Commit&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Commit the files to the repository
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Update the current working version
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;History&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Get the history for the selected file
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Diff&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Get the diff compared to the base version
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Blame&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Find out who committed the crimes in the file
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Revert&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Undo local changes
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Modifications&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Check to see if any files have been modified
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Edit Conflicts&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Edit the conflicts that arise from merging/updating
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Resolve&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Mark the file as resolved for conflicts
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Repository&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; View the repository on the server
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Project History&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Get the history of the entire project
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Add Solution&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Add the solution being edited to source control
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Branch/Tag&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Perform a branch or tag on the current working copy
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Set up TortoiseSVN
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Files In The Distribution&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;SubversionMenu.vssettings&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.  This adds a menu to the IDE for TortoiseSVN with the appropriate icons.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;SubversionMenuToolbar.vssettings&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.  This adds a menu for TortoiseSVN as well as a toolbar using the appropriate icons.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;SubversionMenuToolbarContexts.vssettings&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.  This adds not only the menu and toolbar, but also adds the items to the appropriate context menus for files and solutions.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;SubversionMenuToolbarContextsVS2005.vssettings&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    This provides the menu, toolbar and context menus for TortoiseSVN in Visual Studio 2005.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;SubversionInstall.vbs&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Use this file if you want the external tools only.  These will be appended to the list, otherwise use the settings files.  Don&amp;#8217;t use in addition to the settings file.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    This simply installs a set of External Tools into Visual Studio for common TortoiseSVN operations. It can be installed on versions above Visual Studio.NET (version 7.0). Currently it is configured for Visual Studio 2008 (version 9.0), to make it work on other versions change the variable &amp;#8220;strVisualStudioVersionNumber&amp;#8221; as outlined in the file&amp;#8217;s comments.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Also, if you have installed TortoiseSVN in a non-default location, make sure that you change the variable &amp;#8220;strTortoiseSVNBin&amp;#8221; to the correct binary path. Make sure that the backslashes are doubled up.

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I will also be joined by some other programmers who slave at the coal face of day-to-day development, to share some of their pearls of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to doing some WordPress hacking (expect a few posts about that) and some more artistic designing endeavours. Also expect me to try some web hackery now I have a server to play with &amp;#8211; and I need to get my money&amp;#8217;s worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is incredibly bizarre is that he talks a lot of sense and a lot of it is still applicable today.  Certainly 20 years later substitute assembler for C, and C with a scripting language in the article and you can believe it was a recent article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to believe Microsoft is the same company that Bill Gates is talking about in this interview as he has such a pragmatic outlook towards development.  With those attitudes you can see why Microsoft became successful, but it also shows you can't stay that way forever without great effort.  Most of my teenage years and adult life I have seen Microsoft as this big monopoly and it was nice to see something that shows what it was like before then.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - eGUI++ Easy GUI</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/06/10/gui-toolkits-egui-easy-gui.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-06-10T21:10:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-06-10:blog/2008/06/10/gui-toolkits-egui-easy-gui.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've blogged a few times in the past about &lt;a href="http://torjo.com"&gt;John Torjo&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://torjo.com/win32gui/index.html"&gt;Win32 GUI Generics&lt;/a&gt;.  It was really quite an impressive accomplishment using the advanced C++ techniques in Windows development, but was a bit of a rough diamond. I did do some minor changes to my local copy when I was playing around with it to make sure that the widgets used the correct Windows theming engine, and it was surprisingly easy to add which is a testament to the quality of the code.  It did take ages to compile though with all those templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I notice that now John Torjo has posted &lt;a href="http://torjo.blogspot.com/2008/06/egui-easy-gui-for-c.html"&gt;eGUI++ to his blog&lt;/a&gt;.  Hopefully this is a progression using all he learnt with his previous iteration in Win32 GUI Generics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an article about eGUI++ on the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc534994.aspx"&gt;MSDN here&lt;/a&gt; written by John.  It covers the basics of what he has done and covers some of the features.  It is typesafe at compile time which is great for catching errors early as most GUI toolkits you rarely find those types of problems until runtime (especially when using Windows resources).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download it from &lt;a href="http://torjo.com/egui/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The example presented on that page is quick and to the point.

I have been getting more and more impressed the more I use it because it is so swift to use, by swift I don't mean it runs fast, I mean it gets work done with the minimum of fuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue tracking system is pretty simplistic if you do a direct comparison to something like Bugzilla, but it provides the essentials.  The best bit though is the support for custom fields out of the box, so you can pretty much set up your bug report the way you want it.  You can do all the normal things as well like configuring your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the listview of issue gives you a great context menu that you can use to do common actions like setting the priority, status, and completion percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue tracking also integrates time tracking so you can see the progress.  You have a percentage complete as well as estimated time and actual time.  The time estimations can be tagged with which sub-task took the time (like design, code and test).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a bit of time messing around with the source control integration.  I decided to try it out with a Git installation I had laying about.  In the end it is pretty simple to actually do, and it provides a simple interface with coloured diffs.  This means it becomes trivial to cross reference issues, documents, code, revisions, and more in one place.  I noticed that the commit comments get added to the reports by adding the issue number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The icing on the cake is that it is all wrapped in a clear and intuitive user interface.  It looks good and makes use of all the Javascript goodness that users come to expect and it actually helps to make it easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Bug Databases - Redmine</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/05/29/bug-databases-redmine.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-05-29T22:13:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-05-29:blog/2008/05/29/bug-databases-redmine.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;While on my Internet travels I found a bug database system I hadn't encounterd before called &lt;a href="http://www.redmine.org/"&gt;Redmine&lt;/a&gt;.  It's open-source and based on &lt;a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Ruby-On-Rails&lt;/a&gt;, and provides much more than simply bugtracking.  It refers to itself as a project management tool as it provides enough tools to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features include:
&lt;em&gt; Per project wiki and forums
&lt;/em&gt; Issue tracking
&lt;em&gt; Source control integration (Subversion, CVS, Darcs, Bazaar, Mercurial, Git)
&lt;/em&gt; Gantt chart and calendar
&lt;em&gt; Time tracking functionality
&lt;/em&gt; News, documents &amp;amp; files management&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a quick test install on a Ubuntu virtual machine to see what it was like.  The user interface is really quite slick and very easy to use because it makes the most of Javascript.  Even when you have a list view you get a nice context menu to do the simple and most often done changes (priority and the suchlike).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting parts I found of the system is the paradigm it uses to partition data.  You create a project and it is possible to have per-project wikis, forums, and repositories.  You can even use different source control systems per project. What makes it interesting is that you can point a project at a sub-branch of a repository, so it would be possible to have a project per branch or group of branches.  This would make it much easier to track implementations on a per-branch basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With document and wiki management available it is then possible to integrate the peripheral information for a product with the items involved in actually implementing it.  With the integrated wiki you can also have your requirements and design documents easily at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some of this is very similar to Trac, but it is good to see another tool approaching the same space.  Some of the features like the ease of source control integration is really nice.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Web Development - Pylons</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/05/21/web-development-pylons.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-05-21T19:37:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-05-21:blog/2008/05/21/web-development-pylons.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was reading some information about &lt;a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Ruby On Rails&lt;/a&gt; and watching a few of the &lt;a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/screencasts"&gt;screencasts&lt;/a&gt; and I was really impressed about how fast you can create a database-backed website.  One of the good blogs about it is &lt;a href="http://afreshcup.com/"&gt;A Fresh Cup&lt;/a&gt; where a Microsoft refugee embarks on a career in Rails development.  It pointed to a very interesting article &lt;a href="http://glyphobet.net/blog/essay/228"&gt;Ruby’s Not Ready&lt;/a&gt; whcih compares Ruby to Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through that article I discovered Pyhton has its own "On-Rails" equivalent &lt;a href="http://pylonshq.com/"&gt;Pylons&lt;/a&gt; for rapid website development.  Since Python resources out there are so numerous this would be a very interesting platform to build on.  I guess that also means for enterprising C++ developers using Boost.Python they could have some interesting performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part Pylons seems about as productive as Rails, as outlined in the &lt;a href="http://wiki.pylonshq.com/display/pylonscookbook/Making+a+Pylons+Blog"&gt;tutorial for making a quick blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty easy to try this stuff out on a &lt;a href="http://www.macports.org/"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt; if you have MacPorts installed (and &lt;a href="http://porticus.alittledrop.com/"&gt;Porticus&lt;/a&gt; to make it extra nice).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Goings On In The Land Of Eclipse</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/05/19/goings-on-in-land-of-eclipse.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-05-19T20:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-05-19:blog/2008/05/19/goings-on-in-land-of-eclipse.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been playing around with some of the Alpha/Beta releases of &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;.  I haven't played around with it for quite a while but some of the advancements look really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Eclipse has &lt;a href="http://update.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/S-3.4M7-200805020100/index.php"&gt;3.4.M7&lt;/a&gt; is available for download.  One of the most interesting features is that the user interface now supports WPF on Vista.  The Java toolkit &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Widget_Toolkit"&gt;SWT&lt;/a&gt; now has a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation"&gt;WPF&lt;/a&gt; back-end, you can see its resolution independence if you look at it through the Magnifier application on Windows.  Also, in general, the user interface looks much more integrated into the native platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see a list of new and newsworthy items for Eclipse &lt;a href="http://www.eclipsecon.com/swt/R3_3/new_and_noteworthy.html"&gt;3.3 here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.4M3-200711012000/eclipse-news-M3.html"&gt;3.4 here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason I was trying out the new version was to give the C/C++ toolkit &lt;a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/NewIn50"&gt;CDT 5.0&lt;/a&gt; a go.  Doug Schaefer has blogged about it &lt;a href="http://cdtdoug.blogspot.com/2008/05/cdt-50-looks-good-now-looking-ahead.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was just playing a little with it to see how it compared to the older version and it seems a bit faster.  It has the beginnings of some nice refactorings and templates which should make some common coding tasks a bit simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully when this all comes out &lt;a href="http://wascana.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Wascana&lt;/a&gt; will have a new version released with a nicely packaged C/C++ development environment for Windows.  It could make a compelling alternative to other IDEs, as well as giving you access to other great tools like PyDev (for Python), Mylyn (task and bug management), and I suppose Java as well...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Firefox 3 On The Mac</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/05/18/firefox-3-on-mac.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-05-18T19:45:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-05-18:blog/2008/05/18/firefox-3-on-mac.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been using Firefox 3 on the Mac for the past month so I thought I'd share some of my experiences when using it.  There release candidate download page is &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-rc.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I didn't start using it beforehand was because I was waiting for a supported version of the &lt;a href="http://www.delicious.com"&gt;Del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; bookmarks add-on as it has become indespensible to me.  You can get this &lt;a href="http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2008/04/firefox-3-delicious-and-you.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run a few add-ons to make it look more integrated with Mac OSX:
&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.design-noir.de/mozilla/locationbar2/"&gt;Locationbar 2&lt;/a&gt; for improving the recognition of URLs.
&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1951"&gt;Fission&lt;/a&gt; for the progress in the URL field like Safari.
&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.takebacktheweb.org/"&gt;GrApple Delicious (Blue)&lt;/a&gt; theme which looks very good (and integrated on the Mac).
&lt;/em&gt; And don't forget &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865"&gt;AdBlock Plus&lt;/a&gt; whichever platform you are running on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of those add-ons working (you can also force add-ons to work by using the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6543"&gt;Nightly Tester Tools&lt;/a&gt;) I was ready to use Firefox 3.  For a Beta (and now the Release Candidate) it is amazingly stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire program is much more responsive and lighter on the system resources.  The integration and look and feel (with the add-ons) is excellent, although I would prefer if spell-checking with edit fields to be on by default (although there is a hack &lt;a href="http://www.osxdaily.com/2007/06/06/enable-spell-checking-in-firefox-text-input-fields/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general it is a large step forward although I am not using the biggest new feature - the bookmarks replacement "Places".  As usual though the major feather in Firefox's cap is the add-ons and once you have them you find it impossible to use anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I am using it on Windows Vista at work and it is fast, responsive and looks much better, although I would prefer not to have the blue tinge to the window.  I'd recommend upgrading now because once you've tried 3 you can't go back.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Microsoft STL Performance</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/04/13/microsoft-stl-performance.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-04-13T20:28:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-04-13:blog/2008/04/13/microsoft-stl-performance.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org"&gt;Boost&lt;/a&gt; discussion group there is a discussion started about &lt;a href="http://www.nabble.com/High-Cost-of-MS-"Safe"-STL-for-Release-Builds-td16642449.html#a16642449"&gt;High Cost of MS "Safe" STL for Release Builds&lt;/a&gt;.  It is an interesting look at the massive differences between "safe" and "non-safe" options in Microsoft STL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think there has been a clear look at the efficiencies and inefficiencies in the MS-STL implementation, especially with the different options (iterator debugging and safe options).  There have been some looks at comparing different STL implementations but it always difficult to do a good comparison, the main problem being comparing the correct "latest versions".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back a while I was justifying the use of &lt;a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net/"&gt;STLPort&lt;/a&gt; instead of Microsoft STL supplied with Visual Studio.  Simply, it was a performance thing with both memory and efficiency.  Certainly with the new STLPort visualisers for the Microsoft debugger it is an even playing field for ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;

Gaming is a notoriously secretive industry and is not well renowned for its open-ness, and Insomniac think its mad that developers keep reinvenhttp://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gifting the same core pieces of functionality that don't even make up the bread'n'butter of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is the &lt;a href="http://www.insomniacgames.com/tech/techpage.php"&gt;R&amp;amp;D section on their website&lt;/a&gt;.  This section contains presentations and papers about various subjects including graphics, gameplay, memory and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is the open-source BSD-style licensed code.  The section is called the &lt;a href="http://nocturnal.insomniacgames.com/index.php/Main_Page"&gt;Nocturnal Initiative&lt;/a&gt; and is a wiki.  There are links to community forums which aren't busy yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment some of the source code available is:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;C++ Delegate/Event System&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pointer to reference counted objects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pointer to heap allocated arrays&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Endian conversion code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insertion ordered std::set&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reversible key and value std::map&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interprocess Communication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Fast non-blocking message-based design&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Works over BSD-style sockets (TCP) or Named Pipes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windows platform included, additional platforms are easily added&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Debugging Helpers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;      PDB-based symbol information querying&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Capture stacks within your program making heap object tracking and leak debugging easier&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Give your application automatic crash reports dispatched via email that contain handy user/machine informaton, call stack, and memory page allocation stats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Console Output Manager&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Log console output to one or more trace files&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Color code the console output based on Error/Warning/Debug print statements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Throttle output verbosity (configured via command line arg or environment variable)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Outline nested stages of processing performed by your application (for builders/exporters)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Augment crash reports with the current outline state of your application (very useful for tracking down new crash bugs)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instrumenting Profiler&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Cross platform (Windows and PS3 currently)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Macro-instrumented stack timer based profiler&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Concise profile report printed out at program exit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Logs instance data out to human readable log file (Profile Analyzer is in development)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;C++ Reflection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Instrument your application classes and register them with the type registry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Can serialize object instances to XML or our (faster) custom binary format&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Flexible parsing mechanics allow you to read in old versions of your class&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Handles renaming member variables as well as changing member type (within reasonable limits)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Supports serializing std::vector, std::set, and std::map containers with primitives or pointers to other reflect objects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  Supports serializing enum and bitfield members using string representation (supports reordering enum elements)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Provides for automatic object comparison and cloning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;      Implements introspection using a visitor interface&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Some of it looks pretty good.  I hope this means that there is more sharing of C++ code which is always a good thing, maybe even some of the libraries could be Boost-ified...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>More STL - MCSTL and STXXL</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/04/11/more-stl-mcstl-and-stxxl.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-04-11T19:22:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-04-11:blog/2008/04/11/more-stl-mcstl-and-stxxl.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a few previous posts I have mentioned some alternative STL implementations.  You can read about &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2008/03/stl-related-rdestl.html"&gt;rdestl here&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2008/03/more-stl-ustl-and-stdcxx.html"&gt;uSTL and stdcxx here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've stumbled across a couple of other STL implementations for more specific purposes that I thought some people might find useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is &lt;a href="http://algo2.iti.uni-karlsruhe.de/singler/mcstl/"&gt;MCSTL - The Multi-Core Standard Template Library&lt;/a&gt; which is a multi-core implementation of certain STL algorithms.  This has actually been integrated into the GCC STL implementation with version 4.3.  It uses OpenMP internally for the multi-threading so would be limited to compilers with valid implementations of that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up there is &lt;a href="http://stxxl.sourceforge.net/"&gt;STXXL: Standard Template Library for Extra Large Data Sets&lt;/a&gt;.  I think the blurb sums it up:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The core of STXXL is an implementation of the C++ standard template library STL for external memory (out-of-core) computations, i.e., STXXL implements containers and algorithms that can process huge volumes of data that only fit on disks. While the compatibility to the STL supports ease of use and compatibility with existing applications, another design priority is high performance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;After seeing some extra long and large computations on huge data sets this can be used to get around limitations of the platform with less addressable space.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Visual C++ 2008 Feature Pack Released</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/04/10/visual-c-2008-feature-pack-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-04-10T19:31:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-04-10:blog/2008/04/10/visual-c-2008-feature-pack-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good news for Windows C++ developers the update to Visual Studio 2008 &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/04/07/visual-c-2008-feature-pack-shipped.aspx"&gt;has been released&lt;/a&gt;.  This "Feature Pack" contains some of the new TR1 C++ standard library as well as a major MFC update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details from the Visual C++ Team Weblog can be found &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2008/04/07/visual-c-2008-feature-pack-released.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with some videos and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;TR1 Update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TR1 update is an integration of some more &lt;a href="http://www.dinkumware.com/"&gt;Dinkumware&lt;/a&gt; library functionality.  The features available are:
&lt;em&gt; array - Defines the container template class array and several supporting templates.
&lt;/em&gt; functional - Defines several templates that help construct function objects, which are objects of a type that defines operator(). A function object can be a function pointer, but more typically, the object is used to store additional information that can be accessed during a function call.
&lt;em&gt; memory - Defines a class, an operator, and several templates that help allocate and free objects.
&lt;/em&gt; random - Defines many random number generators.
&lt;em&gt; regex - Defines a template class to parse regular expressions, and several template classes and functions to search text for matches to a regular expression object.
&lt;/em&gt; tuple - Defines a template tuple Class whose instances hold objects of varying types.
&lt;em&gt; type_traits - Defines templates that provide compile-time constants that give information about the properties of their type arguments.
&lt;/em&gt; unordered_map - Defines the container template classes unordered_map and unordered_multimap and their supporting templates.
&lt;em&gt; unordered_set - Defines the container template classes unordered_multiset and unordered_set and their supporting templates.
&lt;/em&gt; utility - Defines several general templates that can be used throughout the Standard Template Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;MFC Update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MFC Update integrates BCGSoft's libraries into the base MFC and provides masses of useful user interface constructs for native developers.  Details from the Visual C++ Weblog is &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2008/04/07/mfc-update-powered-by-bcgsoft.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the new features are:
&lt;em&gt; Office 2007 Ribbon Bar:  Ribbon, Pearl, Quick Access Toolbar, Status Bar, etc.
&lt;/em&gt; Office 2003 and XP look:  Office-style toolbars and menus, Outlook-style shortcut bar, print preview, live font picker, color picker, etc.
&lt;em&gt; Visual Studio look:  sophisticated docking functionality, auto hide windows, property grids, MDI tabs, tab groups, etc.
&lt;/em&gt; Internet Explorer look:  Rebars and task panes.
&lt;em&gt; Vista theme support.
&lt;/em&gt; “On the fly” menus and toolbar customization:  users can customize the running application through live drag and drop of menu items and toolbar buttons.
* Shell management classes:  use these classes to enumerate folders, drives and items, browse for folders and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was extremely impressed with the painless install and the ease of integration (into the shell context menu and the commandline).  The installer size is a trim 8Mb so it is a quick download to try out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing I have tried out at the moment is the newly functioning (for Windows) Subversion bridge.  The git-svn import seems fairly speedy even on Windows and works seamlessly.  It is interesting how efficiently the data gets stored inteh repository as well, and the possibility of reconstructing information that has been lost due to file moves and other lossy operations in Subversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git-GUI also works.  Obviously it does not look spiffy and shiny but presents the information you need, and access to the operations you need (on a basic level).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say Git For Windows is very close to being "ready" and providing you are not in need of the more difficult corner cases it is ready for production use.  The guys working on it have done a great job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all we need is their version of TortoiseSVN to take off called &lt;a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/git-cheetah.git/"&gt;git-cheetah&lt;/a&gt; (which probably is getting easier thanks to some of the Tortoises sharing code now to do with displaying overlays).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Git Is The New Unix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great article about what Git really means as a platform.  You can read it &lt;a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/apenwarr/diary/371.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of opened my eyes to how Git differs from not only other source control systems, but other distributed source control systems.  I recommend giving it a quick read.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GTK+ The Future</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/04/10/gtk-future.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-04-10T18:03:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-04-10:blog/2008/04/10/gtk-future.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lots of information has been revealed recently about possible future directions for GTK+.  There is a comprehensive article on &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/reinventing-gtk.ars"&gt;ArsTechnica here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imendio, one of the active developers of GTK+ made a recent presentation you can see &lt;a href="http://developer.imendio.com/sites/developer.imendio.com/files/gtk-hackfest-berlin2008.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  This outlines what they see as the future direction and release plans for GTK+ in the future, with more detail available in the &lt;a href="http://developer.imendio.com/sites/developer.imendio.com/files/imendio-gtk-vision.pdf"&gt;position document&lt;/a&gt;.  Essentially it involves taking it forward by having a clear roadmap to break the ABI which has been stable for a long time, but has limited leaps forward in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ometer.com/"&gt;Havoc Pennington&lt;/a&gt; had a proposal also, this is available &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/Present?docid=dgn6j4pg_50dw7wh6vt#0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  His proposal did not necessarily overlap the Imendio one but involved using a scenegraph API for defining the UI.  He also suggests looking at the OpenGL based &lt;a href="http://www.clutter-project.org/"&gt;Clutter&lt;/a&gt; which uses a GObject API for its rich user interface experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some additional experimentation has been made with &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071028-making-linux-application-user-interfaces-richer-with-opengl.html"&gt;integrating OpenGL with GTK+&lt;/a&gt;.  A lot of work has been done to try and keep GTK+ up to date with theming and transparency but it can look off the pace especially when attempting to mimic the look of a native platform.  Hopefully all these changes will improve the situation on push the GUI even further since Windows development tools seem to be pushing the "every application looks different" paradigm, Apple making iTunes look the same on all platforms and applications like Songbird using the same theme on all platforms (and still looking good).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>ACCU 2008 Conference</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/04/05/accu-2008-conference.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-04-05T15:46:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-04-05:blog/2008/04/05/accu-2008-conference.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt; These are my interpretations of what I learnt from the talks rather than a transcription of what they said.  This means that I probably misheard and misinterpreted some parts which may be hazardous to your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.displaylink.com"&gt;DisplayLink&lt;/a&gt; were very generous and allowed me to attend the ACCU 2008 conference this year.  I chose to go for Wednesday and Thursday's talkhttp://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gifs, but next time I plan to attend the whole conference.  I thought I would present some thoughts on those talks I did attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it was well worth spending the time at the conference, meeting a variety of interesting people.  I know people always say you learn more in the bar afterwards but I would say there would have to be some pretty intense knowledge exchanges to beat the information I picked up over the two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Value Delivery For Agile Environments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.gilb.com"&gt;Tom Gilb&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.gilb.com/community/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=169"&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can sum up the talk in three words "Measure Measure Measure".  Tom Gilb used his keynote to explain EVO, an envelope framework to surround a smaller development-centric process, which was in this case Agile.  He sees Agile as deficient in that it is a development process geared for delivery, but less thought is put into what you actually deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem comes then with what do you measure, how you measure, and then how do you interpret those metrics.  By doing this and combining it with a fast deliverable methodology like Agile then you end up with constant iterations with feedback able to deal with the changing nature of the world (most probably defined by requirements).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt that the talk had an implicit feeling of "How To Survive".  You need to identify your stakeholders, the people that determine the success and failure of your project and make sure that the needs of the most important and influential ones are met.  If they like what you are doing by meeting and possibly exceeding their needs then you are more likely to gain extra resourcing as you are then seen as a successful group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Bits And Mortar&lt;/span&gt;
Ric Parkin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like an extended episode of Grand Designs we were taken through an analysis of buildings.  Well, no not really, but some of the theories that we are using in computer science have been looked at before and not only recently, in a completely different problem domain, and this field is architecture (and the evolution of buildings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not the world's biggest fan of analogies because pedantics always want to poke holes in it and take it off course thus negating any benefit from using it.  I wish I never used analogies but I am like a lemming following everyone else.  Luckily there was a thoughtful audience and the core was suitably abstract to avoid those problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis of the talk was the work of an architect &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander"&gt;Christopher Alexander&lt;/a&gt;.  He posited the theory of patterns which obviously directly relates to what engineers are doing right now, and in fact sometimes he doesn't even refer to architecture and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to my ignorance all of this was completely new to me, and I could take a lot away from the talk because a lot of the ideas of the evolution of a building (and therefore design) is directly applicable to the realm of computer science.  If you look at a building as a finished intransient product after it has been completed then you forget about the lifetime of the building and how it evolves much like a codebase.  Knowing when to rebuild or rip-down parts requires suitable knowledge of what you are doing and you can also apply patterns other people have proved to be successful subsequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately (for Ric) the talk will be forever remembered as the place he uttered in public "I don't mind introducing bugs".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Practical Multi-Threading&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.dietmar-kuehl.de/"&gt;Dietmar Kuehl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covered the basics of the new C++ standard.  It was a packed room so a lot of people are interested in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It certainly looks like writing multithreaded applications will be much less code in C++ than it has traditionally been.  I like the idea of getting more functionality for less code.  Items like condition variables will be supported in the C++ Standard Library.  There was also a brief part about some of the TR2 features (C++0x + 1) like futures which makes using concurrent processing of independent blocks of code even easier and simplifying the synchronisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also some of this will be helped even more by the lambda expressions as I can see some of the simple operations can be kicked off and calculated independently on a single line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also there was some coverage of &lt;a href="http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/"&gt;Intel's Threading Building Blocks&lt;/a&gt; which provides concurrent containers and also concurrent algorithms like parallel_for or parallel_reduce.  This all provides some higher level semantics for expressing the concepts of multiple threaded processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;When Good Architectures Go Bad&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blog.software-acumen.com/"&gt;Mark Dalgarno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was more of an interactive session where people's experiences fed directly into the talk, so it means each time you would hear a write-up about it there would be a different opinion.  Luckily my group had some interesting anecdotes.  I do wonder why we all stay working in computers if we suffer this much abuse(!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used our experiences of the world to come up with examples of where the architecture had begun to "smell" and what this represented.  Then looking at case studies we attempted to identify and find potential solutions to eliminate these smells.  For my example of a system that had been going for a very long time through so many different platforms, teams, languages, I said to cancel it because it was not making enough money to warrant its existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most frightening solution to architectural decay which also came up at the SPA conference when Mark did it previously, was "Kill The Architect".  I thought I was cynical(!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a talk where you got more out of it if you put more into it.  Hopefully Mark will put up some of the responses he got from the audience on his blog.  In fact he could probably write a very frightening book about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Caging The Effects Monster: The Next Decade's Big Challenge&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/"&gt;Simon Peyton-Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately due to beer-and-lack-of-sleep-related circumstances I decided to close my eyes in a darkened room for the duration of this talk.  I did not feel too guilty as I had seen Simon's talks for the &lt;a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge"&gt;BCS SPA Cambridge meetings&lt;/a&gt;.  I posted about that talk &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2008/03/spa-talks-continuous-integration-and.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional programming track at the ACCU Conference seemed to be really well attended and seems to have grabbed the imagination of a number of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Future Of Concurrency In C++&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/"&gt;Anthony Williams&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/files/future_of_concurrency.pdf"&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk was hosted by the maintainer of the Boost.Threads library.  He went through some of the more complex parts of the upcoming C++0x and C++0x TR2 as well as what is available through Boost.Threads currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite parts of the entire thing is the concept of thread-local storage as a built-in keyword.  No more GetTLS and the suchlike.  I could immediately see a use of a static member of a class that is per-thread in order to create a memory allocator for STL containers which would allocate via only the thread's heap.  If you know that some information is local to a single thread then you won't have any memory contention (in the program - I am not thinking about the hardware or underlying implementation) to slow down the memory access.  You have to have a clear design and use of this though otherwise you could blow your program's brains out, but also that design works very nicely with thread pools...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately some of the higher level concepts will take until probably the next standard TR2 to get to compilers.  Of note this will contain thread pools and futures.  Futures mean you can run a thread for a calculation and start it off in a single statement and thehttp://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gifn check the result after doing some more work and it will wait until the result is posted.  Also getting the result will then propogate any exceptions that had occurred on the calculation thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing is a large portion of the C++0x threading implementation is available through Boost.Threads thanks to Anthony's sterling efforts for 1.35, so you can always have a play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Adobe Source Libraries : Overview And Philosophy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/sean.parent/"&gt;Sean Parent&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://stlab.adobe.com/"&gt;Adobe Source Libraries (ASL) Open-Source&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://stlab.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Papers_and_Presentations"&gt;Lots of interesting papers and articles&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.stepanovpapers.com/"&gt;Alexander Stepanov's collection of papers, articles and presentations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of worse things to be remembered for but I hope that Sean Parent is not only thought of as Alexander Stepanov's boss.  He heads up the Software Technologies Lab at Adobe that create generic libraries that are used in all Adobe's products.  This talk was divided into two sections, one concentrating on the data structures and generic programming, and the other about declarative UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very interesting part of the talk is the way he said he was using Alexander Stepanov's skills, he basically said "Write a book defining generic programming".  The research for this has lead to lots of leaps forwards for Adobe's programming technologies.  Also he said that Stepanov gives lectures to the Adobe programming staff to improve their education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk started a little above my head by defining Regular Types which is very similar to the definitions and rules for what can be derived for functional programming except you can have side-effects.  This then provides the basis for generic programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a close look at the ideas behind the Move library currently maintained by Adobe but could go (back) into Boost.  This library uses Return Value Optimisation to minimise and eliminate copies, and I was surprised to learn this was through the use of passing by value rather than by reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a look at the copy_on_write functionality which meant the object is only copied when it is written to and it uses the move library as part of its basis.  This also provides the platform for Adobe's history tool in Photoshop and minimises memory impact.  Then there was a look at the Forest container which approaches the binary tree in a very tidy way.  Also they have a string library that uses the move library so concatenations are much more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are the right tools to solve certain datatype problems in a very concise and efficient fashion.  But the idea behind it all is to only use small pieces of code as building blocks towards the larger solutions.  What they want to do is reduce the number of lines of code declaring the applications by a very large factor (like from 3 million to 30,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second half of the talk was based around declarative UI and the structures Adobe have put in place to solve problems that still exist to this day.  I've looked at the two main libraries that make this up before called Adam and Eve, where both really amount to being constraint solvers, one solving the data and one solving the layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layout library is probably the simplest to explain as it works out from the size algorithms you provide the layout that follows the guides that have been set up.  This also means that it can scale the layouts with relative ease.  The scripting language is used to define the layout called Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The property library is used to solve data dependencies (a lot of which are typically cyclic) for user interfaces.  I have used something similar but much more simplistic in the past because it keeps the data separate from the UI itself.  This also means that you can script the operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The papers and documentation on the Adobe site can probably explain all this much better then I ever could, but they are al interesting building blocks for solutions to some overlooked problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I enjoyed the talk especially the first half as it was a bit eye opening their practical approach to implementing generic programming with real benefits.  Unfortunately the talk was really badly attended considering both halves were up against some tough competition (especially about functional programming), but hey they all missed out on some really good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>DisplayLink for Mac OSX</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/03/31/displaylink-for-mac-osx.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-31T19:12:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-03-31:blog/2008/03/31/displaylink-for-mac-osx.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Something work related for a change...  As you can see from my profile I work for &lt;a href="http://www.displaylink.com"&gt;DisplayLink&lt;/a&gt; where we make USB display technology.

&lt;p&gt;Here at &lt;a href="http://www.displaylink.com"&gt;DisplayLink&lt;/a&gt; we have just released the Beta version of our Mac OSX software.

It covers mainly how to train people in C++ and the future of C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part of the entire interview is the bit about the ISO standard committee and how it all works.  People seem to complain C++ doesn't move fast enough (although the same people also complain there is too much as well).  What interested me is that it is lacking in funds.  Now I am pretty sure that every software company in the world has some C++ to varying degrees with most of them being critical to the company itself.  Yet, there is no funding or involvement in what is an open process for the language, the most I have seen by some is some people write one of those whitepapers (for instance the EASTL) and then chuck it into the ether.  It looks like it is a lot of hard work to really be serious about and to succeed at improving the language, and even Microsoft couldn't succeed in circumventing the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this could be considered pot calling the kettle black because I have no involvement and nor does my employer(or my previous employers), but I am still fresh at knowing exactly what is going on (even at the age of 30!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose in an ideal world there would be less Not-Invented-Here (NIH) Syndrome and more participation in helping to improve the libraries and the core language.  I am not saying though that the people who use it are to blame as the committee should really have some form of outreach better than they currently have.  Boost is being moderately successful in its outreach which is helped by the mailing lists/forums and website as well as participating in things like the Google Summer Of Code.  Just imagine if the C++ Standards Committee could get the talented top 1% of C++ developers involved...  As developers we could help shape the future of the language and provide real solutions, which is more than could be said for something that is commercially controlled (even if it is published as an open standard).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Boost 1.35 Released</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/03/30/boost-135-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-30T19:45:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-03-30:blog/2008/03/30/boost-135-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A new version of the &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/"&gt;Boost Library&lt;/a&gt; for C++ has been released.

Boost is a great addition to any C++ developer's armament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is also the first release using all their new tools and processes (Subversion, Trac, website and other stuff) so I think it is possible that future releases will be more frequent with this framework in place, because I think the plan was originally to have a release twice a year.  That might mean there is a possibility of the logging library by &lt;a href="http://www.torjo.com"&gt;John Torjo&lt;/a&gt; being integrated soon as well as some others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Merge Tracking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important feature in the upcoming 1.5.  The initial concept is based on svnmerge.py but has gone far beyond that and is fully integrated into the repository format.  This means it will be possible to see which revisions have yet to be merged or have already been done.  For people with complex branching or regular merging it should be an indispensable feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting links about it are &lt;a href="http://blogs.open.collab.net/svn/2007/05/the_subversion__1.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.open.collab.net/svn/2007/11/what-about-bran.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blogs.open.collab.net/svn/2007/11/branching-strat.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The functional spec is available &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/merge-tracking/func-spec.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Sparse Checkouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows for checking out portions of a larger repository.  This means it is possible to specify the depth that the operations take into the directory structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Conflict Resolution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are improvements to the conflict resolution for merges.  It is now possible to use the command-line to perform the resolution and a better interface for graphical clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Changelists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to work on several sets of files on a single working copy.  You can associate those files together with a name in order to work on more than one problem in a single working copy.  I really needed this feature at work today trying to do more than one thing in a single working copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Externals Improvements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improvements allow svn:externals to be pegged at a revision.  Also they can use relative paths from the current directory (that will be really good in some instances with external deliverables) and if you use externals it makes managing a code tree much easier because it treats it like it is part of the current code tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Copy/Rename Improvements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an improvement in the behaviour on copy/renaming of files (not currently directories until version 1.6) by the client trying to be smarter.  If a file has been renamed/copied then rather than the server sending the whole new file it does the copy operation so you should not lose the changes that had been made to the old file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;TortoiseSVN 1.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be released not long after the main Subversion 1.5 release.  The major changes will be the user interface work for merge tracking, changesets, and sparse checkouts.  There are some other features that will be part of the 1.5 release:
&lt;em&gt; Client side hook scripts – You can run some scripts before or after committing - this should help people create better processes.
&lt;/em&gt; If a program has done some file operations like renaming and deleting without using the Subversion interface (drag-right-click) then it is possible to fix the file relationships in the UI.  This would be quite useful to inte3grate as an external tool in Visual Studio.
&lt;em&gt; Repository browser now has a two pane look like Windows Explorer with a tree-view and list of files.  Apparently it is much faster.
&lt;/em&gt; A new merge wizard rather than the dialog which improves the workflow for merging.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - GTK+ 3.0</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/03/13/gui-toolkits-gtk-30.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-13T22:23:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-03-13:blog/2008/03/13/gui-toolkits-gtk-30.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;GTK+ is used by a large variety of programs on a decent number of platforms.  It doesn't have the best reputation for certain bits and pieces, some fairly, some unfairly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions have begun on what will be the new version of GTK+ 3.0.  The most important news is that they will be able to break the ABI which they have heroically maintained all through the 2.0 releases, this should mean lots of good stuff now they are let off the leash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out the start at this &lt;a href="http://federkiel.wordpress.com/2008/03/12/gtk-30-getting-serious/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The touchstones for the GUI toolkit will be to improve the theming abilities (which in theory will improve look and feel cross platform), animations for swishy interfaces, and proper canvas widget/window.  It will be remaining C which is excellent news for the millions of easy language bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be interesting to see what happens, hopefully only concentrating on the GUI rather than a lot of the other toolkits which are a bit "kitchen sink" will do for it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Lucasarts - The Good Old Days</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/03/13/lucasarts-good-old-days.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-13T21:43:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-03-13:blog/2008/03/13/lucasarts-good-old-days.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now I am 30 I can get away with saying things were so much better in the olden days.  Actually, no that is not even vaguely true, there is always probably the same good to crap ratio, but the marketing of the crap means you have to dig a little deeper and smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway in the olden days Lucasarts the gaming arm of all things Star Wars was actually astoundingly good at making games.  They had the best and brightest and created some of the most unforgettable experiences a person could have on their computer.  Their adventure games were masterclasses for scripting and game echanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway on to the point of this post - some linkage - two great articles about Lucsart classics, from the very beginning and the very end of their work in adventure games:
&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_139/2994-Walk-Don-t-Run"&gt;Grim Fandango&lt;/a&gt; - Walk Don't Run

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/ContinuousIntegration"&gt;Continuous Integration&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://oocode.com/"&gt;Ivan Moore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second talk by Ivan Moore after his interactive talk about Test-Drive-Development (which was a crash course on Java as well).  This time it was not as interactive but just as practical.  In addition to the slides he actually demonstrated his own continuous integration system (available from Sourceforge) &lt;a href="http://build-o-matic.sourceforge.net/"&gt;build-o-matic&lt;/a&gt;.  It has some interesting features like pictures to show the guilty parties when thebuild or tests break.  It also is quite a simple build system which means you can more or less build anything with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was preaching to the converted as most of the audience were practicing continuous integration anyway.  I think the main lesson to take away from the talk is to not compromise at any point on the builds or the tests even in with a heavy workload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/TypeDrivenTestingInHaskell"&gt;Type Driven Development in Haskell&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/"&gt;Simon Peyton-Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk was really about how to write more robust programs in functional programming.  The talk involved more of a discussion of functional languages and their benefits as well as how to write tests that more define the concepts and rules for inputs and the outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly the testing part reminded me of the static assertions that are available in the C++ Boost Library.  I think that there must be a bridge to utilise more aspects of functional programming in a library like fashion because of the interesting optimisations that can be made.  Also mathematical correctness is a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lecture itself was interesting and certainly animated.  The sign of a good talk is that it makes you think, and I am certainly thinking about functional languages and their applications (after all templates can be used in that fashion but it does put a lot of strain on the compiler). I can certainly see some useful applications in the field of CAD/CAM - shame I left hat field...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>iPhone SDK</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/03/06/iphone-sdk.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-06T20:01:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-03-06:blog/2008/03/06/iphone-sdk.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After nearly a decade of avoiding having a mobile phone the iPhone was the device that made me change my mind.  It is a great device that means I use my laptop a lot less because I can surf the 'Net and get my imap gmail on it in a very seamless fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Apple announced the iPhone SDK (the website has completely crashed for me....).  It will give a whole new ease of life to an already excellent product.  One of the greatest aspects of the iPhone is that it is constantly updated with new features like a full computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a comprehensive &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/06/live-from-apples-iphone-press-conference/"&gt;write-up on Engadget&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/03/06/developers-licking-their-fingers-over-cocoa-touch-iphone-sdk"&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt; of all the announcements today including proper Exchange support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SDK gives access via Objective-C to the OS features.  You get access to the accelerometers and multi-touch when writing your apps.  XCode provides the environment to develop in and there is an iPhone simulator. The features you have access to are:
&lt;em&gt; Keychain
&lt;/em&gt; Bonjour
&lt;em&gt; SQLite
&lt;/em&gt; Core Location
&lt;em&gt; Quicktime media layer
&lt;/em&gt; Core Audio
&lt;em&gt; Core Image
&lt;/em&gt; Core Animation
&lt;em&gt; PDF rendering
&lt;/em&gt; OpenAL
* OpenGL ES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The games look pretty damn good on the iPhone fromt he presentation from Super Monkey Ball to Spore to the specially designed Touch Fighter.  It looks like a Wii style changing of the game by using the advantages that the device offers rather than dwelling on what is now missing in comparison to gaming systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the apps created will be distributed by the App Store that will be run by Apple.  If you develop free or open-source apps Apple will host them and distribute them for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also there is a leak of the BBC iPlayer for the iPhone mentioned in &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/06/live-from-apples-iphone-press-conference/comments/10866456/"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt; on Engadget.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>More STL - uSTL and stdcxx</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/03/05/more-stl-ustl-and-stdcxx.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-05T19:34:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-03-05:blog/2008/03/05/more-stl-ustl-and-stdcxx.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a commenter on the &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2008/03/stl-related-rdestl.html"&gt;RDESTL post&lt;/a&gt; I made yesterday, they pointed me at the &lt;a href="http://ustl.sourceforge.net/"&gt;uSTL&lt;/a&gt; (I assume pronounced micro-STL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a partial implementation of the STL specification.  It reduces code size by making memory allocation a non-templated base class.  As far as I can tell this reduces executable size because of less template bloat.  Whether it is faster or smaller in memory for the containers is another matter.  I suppose by reducing the executable size  cache coherency could be improved leading to some interesting speed-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is for POSIX-based systems, and there is no maintained Windows port (a choice of the developer) although some peole have got it to work on Windows with differing levels of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another STL implementation I stumbled across is the &lt;a href="http://stdcxx.apache.org/"&gt;Apache stdcxx&lt;/a&gt;.  The project was started from a code donation by Rogue Wave who decided to open-source their commercial offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2007 stdcxx made it to an Apache Top-Level Project which means it should be well supported.  And apparently performance s quite good as well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>STL-related : rdestl</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/03/04/stl-related-rdestl.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-04T20:16:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-03-04:blog/2008/03/04/stl-related-rdestl.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while back I &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/09/eastl-and-allocators.html"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2271.html"&gt;EASTL&lt;/a&gt; - Electronic Arts Standard Template Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting look at how EA have internally implemented their own STL with their own improvements/changes specific to their problem domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://msinilo.pl/blog/"&gt;Maciej Sinilo&lt;/a&gt; has spent some time putting together a small subset of the STL changed for some game development requirements called the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rdestl/"&gt;RDESTL&lt;/a&gt;.  The related blog posts can be read &lt;a href="http://msinilo.pl/blog/?p=25"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://msinilo.pl/blog/?p=28"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://msinilo.pl/blog/?p=33"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It provides some basic containers (vector, etc), a string class, and some additional container types like intrusive containers.  It also provides the EASTL outlook on allocators (which I don't agree with but that is another story).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is definitely interesting to see the code as it is quite readable.  I do wonder whether it achieved part of the EASTL goal which was allowing the compiler to optimise more aggressively because the code is simpler with less indirection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, here is a &lt;a href="http://www.spreetree.net/blog/?p=7"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to someone else who is replacing the STL.

The subject is &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;"Type-driven testing in Haskell"&lt;/span&gt; so people who have an interest in functional languages should like it.  As usual the talk is free and there is a light buffet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Synopsis:

One of the joys of functional programming is that code is so much more testable. For a start, testing pure functions is much easier than testing side-effecting procedures. Better still the auto-generation of test cases can be done by a library, without any external tools. And where we want exhaustive testing, it is possible to use lazy evaluation to cut the search space dramatically. I’ll explain these idea using demos from Quickcheck and Lazy Smallcheck, two popular libraries.

While the focus of this talk is testing, I’ll introduce functional programming as I go along, so that you don’t already have to know Haskell to make sense of the ideas. I’ll also try to give a flavour of why I think you’ll be seeing a lot more crossover of functional programming ideas into the mainstream, over the next few years.

Simon Peyton Jones, MA, MBCS, CEng, graduated from Trinity College Cambridge in 1980. After two years in industry, he spent seven years as a lecturer at University College London, and nine years as a professor at Glasgow University, before moving to Microsoft Research (Cambridge) in 1998.

His main research interest is in functional programming languages, their implementation, and their application. He has led a succession of research projects focused around the design and implementation of production-quality functional-language systems for both uniprocessors and parallel machines. He was a key contributor to the design of the now-standard functional language Haskell, and is the lead designer of the widely-used Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). He has written two textbooks about the implementation of functional languages.

More generally, he is interested in language design, rich type systems, software component architectures, compiler technology, code generation, runtime systems, virtual machines, and garbage collection. He is particularly motivated by direct use of principled theory to practical language design and implementation -- that's one reason he loves functional programming so much.

&lt;p&gt;Well someone has done a great job with a DSEL (domain specific embedded language) with a toolkit called &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/mythos/"&gt;Mythos&lt;/a&gt;.  To quote the website &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;"Mythos is a GUI library written in C++ using modern C++ techniques."&lt;/span&gt;  It does state on the website that it is more of a proof of concept than a fully-blown attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it looks really interesting and has a few different components that make it up.  There is &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;khaos&lt;/span&gt; which does the low level windowing bits and pieces.  &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;nyx&lt;/span&gt; is the window layout library with a DSEL that lets you define the ayout in the C++ files.  &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;iris&lt;/span&gt; does the event handling with another DSEL for associating events and actions.  &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;gaia&lt;/span&gt; is the widget abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it looks like a very interesting use of modern C++ applied to GUI toolkits.  It is a different approach to something like &lt;a href="http://stlab.adobe.com/"&gt;Adobe's ASL&lt;/a&gt; (adam and eve) but I think if the use of the code generation available through templates should be used to take the legwork out of defining user interfaces.

&lt;p&gt;But deep in the bowels of the OS there are some interesting things, but they tend to be undocumented.  I'm not a fan of the layering of the GUI, and I always wondered if it was possible to use the base parts of the GUI DLLs which things like WP use as teir basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some exceedingly talented and clever developers have spent their brain cycles reverse engineering the completely undocumented dwm and milcore.dll (apart from the thumbnail API).  I'm not a fan of all the managed stuff especially since it mainly resoves down to the unmanaged core DLLs anyway.  Go &lt;a href="http://siwu.info/"&gt;check out the blog here&lt;/a&gt; with lots of videos of some exceedingly clever things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is even better is that the developer has released it as &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/dwmaxx/"&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt;.  Hopefully this will provide a basis for more adventurous and useful developments.  With this amount of flexibility available then it should be possible to create something where Vista gets some good productivity gains.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Useful Free Mac Applications</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/01/30/useful-free-mac-applications.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-30T20:55:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-01-30:blog/2008/01/30/useful-free-mac-applications.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm tight, if there is a free tool to do something I will find it.

An open-source library &lt;a href="http://libsh.org/"&gt;libsh&lt;/a&gt; provides a high level metaprogramming language in C++ for programming GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, libsh is no longer actively developed because the developers behind it have created a commercial business around it (those lucky guys have found a way to make programming pay!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to utilise the processing power of the GPU, essentially treating the hardware like another (more specialised) processing core.  After all graphics cards have more transistors than the average CPU...  I think I mentioned something like this in my &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/12/multiple-core-madness.html"&gt;multithreading post&lt;/a&gt; many a moon ago.  But I suppose also it ties into virtualisation of the procesing hardware available on the computer which I even &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/10/virtualisation-understanding.html"&gt;posted about before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great website for this type of stuff is &lt;a href="http://www.gpgpu.org/"&gt;General-Purpose Computation Using Graphics Hardware&lt;/a&gt; which does exactly what it says on the tin.  There are active forums and tons of news and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly there is not a huge amount of general purpose stuff out there freely available but as GPUs become more powerful and more programmable I am sure that will change.  Personally I think the future would be to use a core of these multi-core processors to do the graphics, even if it is slightly specialised for stream processing or something.  That would certainly negate the need for faster graphics buses as it would run on the processor (although other buses would still need to progress).  But yet again I have digressed....&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>C++ Static Code Analysis</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/01/21/c-static-code-analysis.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-21T21:49:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-01-21:blog/2008/01/21/c-static-code-analysis.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned before about the usefulness of &lt;a href="http://www.gimpel.com/"&gt;PC-Lint&lt;/a&gt; when doing C++ development on Windows.

When starting a new development project the initial decisions you make reflect throughout the life of the codebase because once the ship is in sail it is hard to change direction without real willingness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are really two areas that this would cover, first the tools you use, and then how you use those tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets say that you are developing on Windows.  You would use Visual Studio instinctively, unfortunately the build system sucks in the worst way when it comes to project dependencies and command-line operations. You could use something like CMake or bjam or any one of the other build systems available.  The problem then is that the features always lag behind what is available within the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am going off on a tangent.  I am deciding on a development environment for a new project (C++).  Right then what could we use that is more or less free...
&lt;em&gt; Source control : Subversion
    The main reason to use this is that there are so many tools available (most specifically TortoiseSVN).
&lt;/em&gt; Bug tracking : Trac
    I would rather a more powerful bug tracking system (I am a big fan of Bugzilla) but the tight integration with Subversion is a major plus point.  Plus you get a wiki for free, and with the plug-ins you can have continuous integration and a myriad of other things integrated in one Intranet website.
&lt;em&gt; Compiler : Visual Studio
    This means you can support 32 and 64-bit (which MinGW sadly lacks at the moment) targets.
&lt;/em&gt; Continuous Integration : Cruise Control.NET
    Regular builds make sure that you haven't gone too far down the wrong path.  It can also be used to do other processes like testing or analysis.  You can integrate it with Trac as well here http://syntactic.org/2007/7/23/cruisecontrol-net-trac-integration or here https://oss.werkbold.de/trac-cc/.
&lt;em&gt; Wiki : Trac
    Developer documentation should be quick and easy to edit and should be encourages.  It's good news it is also part of Trac.
&lt;/em&gt; Unit testing : Boost
    Using Boost in a C++ project makes perfect sense, so using their unit testing framework would therefore be a good idea.  It can be difficult to drive but other C++ unit testing frameworks are as much a pain so rolling your own could also be an idea.
* Batch testing : Python
    Python scripting would be a good idea for doing actual system testing.  What would be even better is the ability to run the program due to Python being embedded in the program to drive it.  Get the output well formed and I think it can be integrated with Trac as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start:
&lt;em&gt; All commits must have a comment and preferably a bug number so you can always work out the reasoning behind all edits.  Being able to work out why is always useful to a developer.
&lt;/em&gt; Compile with the warning levels on the maximum available level and have warnings as errors.
* Try to use some static analysis like Lint to improve the baseline coe quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By building in high standards in the beginning you don't have to go through laborious and error-prone tasks later in the day retrofitting some standard process.  Also, I like the idea of having Trac as a port of call or documentation, source code, and analysis means as a developer you can't complain any of the process is too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've probably left out loads but its a start at least...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>DisplayLink lots of links</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2008/01/14/displaylink-lots-of-links.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-14T20:27:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2008-01-14:blog/2008/01/14/displaylink-lots-of-links.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Working for a new company is weird.

The main features are substantial updates to MFC and TR1 library support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;The VC++ 2008 MFC libraries have been extended to support creation of applications that have:
    * Office Ribbon style interface
    * Office 2007, Office 2003 and Office XP look and feel
    * Modern Visual Studio-style docking toolbars and panes
    * Fully customizable toolbars and menus
    * A rich set of advanced GUI controls
    * Advanced MDI tabs and groups
    * And much more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature pack also includes an implementation of TR1. Portions of TR1 are scheduled for adoption in the upcoming C++0x standard as the first major addition to the ISO 2003 standard C++ library. Our implementation includes a number of important features such as:
    * Smart pointers
    * Regular expression parsing
    * New containers (tuple, array, unordered set, etc)
    * Sophisticated random number generators
    * Polymorphic function wrappers
    * Type traits
    * And more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This feature pack does not include C99 compatibility or support for special math functions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly for anyone maintaining MFC based products it is a free upgrade tot he look and feel of the program with tons of advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

The main reason is that I had my head down before starting a new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was my first day at &lt;a href="http://www.displaylink.com"&gt;Displaylink&lt;/a&gt; which is a rapidly expanding display technology company in Cambridge who are good enough to host the &lt;a href="http://www.accu.org"&gt;ACCU Meetings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I can now get back to a normal blogging service now all of the upheaval should be coming to an end.

I'm a bit of a hoarder, a magpie maybe, collecting shiny things.  When I encounter a seemingly useful piece of code on the Internet I would download it and dump it into my downloads directory.  I've probably got gigabytes of the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what it is.  I certainly feel that whatever I try to do someone must have at least tried it out before, so Google is my best friend in that respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could say it is because C++ has so much not in the standard library that is available in frameworks like .NET and others.  Maybe, but then that gives you choice and encourages you to think about the problem you are trying to solve and the best solution that you can come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately loads of these tools and libraries are open-source so it is possible to help improve the baseline of thee libraries.  Unfortunately you need to know where to look to find these as there is no central resource that can point you in the right direction to find the libraries that would be best for you.  The closest I have found is the &lt;a href="http://www.twilightsembrace.com/personal/gamelibs.php"&gt;Free Game Development Libraries Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one of the skills I have picked up from being such a magpie is the ability to look at other people's code and to bend it to my own devices.  Say for instance there is something useful, but not quite what I want on CodeProject, I'd refactor the code (way too much avoids &lt;a href="http://www.kirit.com/On following rules/Encapsulation is a Good Thing™"&gt;encapsulation&lt;/a&gt; over there) and bring it in line with my own coding guidelines.  I am then in a position to use and extend the code further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Invented Here Syndrome I don't see as a good thing or at least a strict adherence to it is a weaknes.  By reusing code you also have the possibility of giving something back as well to the potential "state of the art".  Certainly not all code should be off-the-shelf and cookie cutter simplified implementations but it should provide the basis of what you are doing in order to avoid reinventing the wheel.  I certainly see understanding someone else's code as an important skill in development.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>STLPort Visual Studio 2005 Visualisers - autoexp.dat</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/12/13/stlport-visual-studio-2005-visualisers.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-12-13T21:23:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-12-13:blog/2007/12/13/stlport-visual-studio-2005-visualisers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a comment on one of the posts about autoexp.dat and STLPort where I did a bit of a ham-fisted attempt at creating visualisers for STL containers in the Visual Studio 2005 debugger, I have been informed that there is a much better (and more comprehensive) version than my hack.&lt;/p&gt;

There are actually two parts to the library, a thread-safe set of allocators and the multithreading library including algorithms and thread-safe containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is designed with the STL in mind (I suppose the developers would hope for an eventual inclusion into the standard library). It seems to be designed at a higher level semantically than a lot of other threading libraries and could help people to try it out much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most obvious place to try out some of the parallelisation is the "parallel_for" loop.  It's interesting that speed optimisation can be tried out with a "grain size" as it is a trade off between the overhead of performing parallel operations and making use of the processor(s).  It all works in a similar fashion to the normal STL algorithms and containers with some additional classes like "ranges" for the begin and end of your divided up operation.  In fact it all seems so strangely easy to do, if you have to do calculations and construct new data, stick them in one of the thread-safe containers and you will be laughing.  Admittedly if you do use "normal loops" in your code, you need to STL-ise them, but that is a fairly trivial operation to turn them into functors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all though it looks quite good, and easy to use if you are parallelising simple loops.  I am sure some programs will find substantial speed-ups and blow up a few CPUs with over-use from that.  I could tell you a story that Intel tech support said we shouldn't run a Pentium III CPU at 100% use consistently back in the day...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Cool Use For Virtualisation</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/12/03/cool-use-for-virtualisation.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-12-03T20:47:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-12-03:blog/2007/12/03/cool-use-for-virtualisation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Virtualisation is obviously the hot computing technology of the moment.

&lt;p&gt;The good thing now is VMWare Workstation is free so you can use images anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What impressed me though is that as part of the pursuit of X-Box Media Centre for Linux they have the entire development environment available &lt;a href="http://xboxmediacenter.com/forum/showthread.php?t=26664"&gt;as a VMWare image&lt;/a&gt;.  That makes life so much easier for developers!  It means you don't have to fiddle with  your settings and deal with other potential conflicts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is just a great way to use the technology and lower the barriers for development and guarantee a consistent development environment.

I guess this might be similar to the deal with Dinkumware for the STL implementation that Microsoft license a version of and then bolt their own things into.  Obviously it is not as good as having the actual implementation used by Microsoft in their modern products (Office 2007) but it is a start.&lt;/p&gt;

It was an interesting presentation on the new features and capabilities of Fogbugz with some nice little anecdotes dropped in for good measure.  Most of the time was spent on the new Evidence Based Scheduling feature which is quite nice and will help with estimation accuracy., taking some of the uncertainty away from that aspect of the development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fogbugz makes a good thanks to the AJAX interface, although I won't say it looks awesome with the default skin.  The AJAX features certainly makes the user interface have less friction for use and has some nice touches to minimise clicking and the such. It would probably make even more sense as one of the Adobe AIR type apps to make it integrate into the desktop or something along those lines with gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that was lacking for me unless I am really weak with my Google searching is bug relationships.  You can create links to other bugs and they are listed in the bug report, but in systems like &lt;a href="http://www.bugzilla.org"&gt;Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt; you can have a rich relationship.  This means you can create dependency graphs and define the types of relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid I would not recommend spending money on it for my situation.  It is a tool that works best for developers and in the development situation, and not a company-wide tool (unfortunately, although it could theoretically work), but I am all for making developers lives easier.  It is just I feel that if you have a technically adept development team then they will be capable of accomplishing the same goals with other tools.  This is especially necessary as most development teams can never get financial approval for new or better tools (unfortunately it is still what I hear from most people since most developers have given up asking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose what I am getting round to saying is that if you are using Subversion or a supported version control system, you should try out &lt;a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/"&gt;Trac&lt;/a&gt;.  The integration between source control, wiki (documents), issues, and more are excellent (and it looks good).  It is a developer's tool though rather than a forward facing tool for customers, but it will improve the development team's workflow.  It can do more or less everything Fogbugz can do with the default install plus the whole host of &lt;a href="http://trac-hacks.org/"&gt;Trac Hacks&lt;/a&gt;.  I've &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/10/tools-to-make-developers-life-easier.html"&gt;blogged about this tool before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit I am a big fan of Bugzilla because the bug reporting system is so rich and configurable.  If it had the Subversion and plug-ins equivalent to Trac then it would be amazing.  As things stand though Trac does work a treat, hell even open-source projects are using Trac to host their websites like &lt;a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org"&gt;OpenSceneGraph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - MFC v9 - Visual Studio 2008 - An Update</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/11/08/gui-toolkits-mfc-v9-visual-studio-2008.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-11-08T16:25:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-11-08:blog/2007/11/08/gui-toolkits-mfc-v9-visual-studio-2008.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I blogged a while back about the secret MFC features for VS2008 (MFC v9) &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/10/gui-toolkits-mfc-v9-visual-studio-2008.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

wxWidgets 3.0 will be released in 2008.  You can read some details &lt;a href="http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/2007/11/looking-forward-to-wxwidgets-3.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your viewpoint) this new major release will not be the radical rethink that has been mooted for the past couple of years.  The major feature will be the full integration of unicode which would be the only build type (as there was also an ANSI configuration).  This means that ANSI would get converted into unicode internally.  This new version will also require minimal changes to existing code to get it to compile.  I suppose people already working in unicode could potentially have no more upheaval than a point release.

This means all the plans which suggested the radical rethink for v3 have been moved under &lt;a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/wiki/index.php/Development:_wxTNG"&gt;wxTNG on the wiki&lt;/a&gt;.  Certainly noone ever agreed on direction for this and this does mean there will be no compatibility issues.  Hopefully this means a gradual move to newer ideas rather than the complete redesign, which would be more likely to reap some results (eg, like improving the messaging framework would be one such thing).  Another avenue I reckon which would make more sense is to use current wx as a backend for a more experimental API.

Anyway it certainly is an extremely comprehensive framework with a liberal license unlike some other options, also the Python bindings in &lt;a href="http://wxpython.org/"&gt;wxPython&lt;/a&gt; are really very good</summary></entry><entry><title>Visual Studio 2008 - Out late November 2007</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/11/05/visual-studio-2008-out-late-november.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-11-05T19:32:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-11-05:blog/2007/11/05/visual-studio-2008-out-late-november.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Microsoft have announced Visual Studio 2008 &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/nov07/11-05TechEdDevelopersPR.mspx"&gt;will be released at the end of November 2007&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;What you have to work out is whether it is closed or open source, whether the binaries are supplied, and how you keep the user from having broken interfaces on different versions.  All of this is from the point of view from a C++ programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is best to start with how not to write a closed-source library:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt; Do not use templates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Do not have implementation half in the binary and half in the headers.&lt;br /&gt;* Do not expose the innards of your program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating a closed-source library you have to firewall the innards (which are probably commercially sensitive) from the interface.  This would mean some use of the &lt;a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PimplIdiom"&gt;Pimpl Idiom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to use solidly defined types like if you were binding to another language like Python.  This means that the implementation can live in the binary and the interface is defined in your headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems it is easy to encounter is when STL is exposed in the library.  The problem occurs when people use different implementations of the standard library which means you either need to maintain versions for that particular setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making those two decisions you can massively simplify the maintenance and the headaches of people trying to implement it.  You have to think carefully about the simplest interface for the developers who have to work out how to integrate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By not exposing the innards of the library you can also protect yourself from problems when the library loads/unloads because you can't have conflicting CRTs/libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose what I am suggesting is to have the most simple public interface and make sure that all implementation is hidden away.  Almost only using a C interface for a library means you don't encounter the problems where you have to think about supplying a version for each version of the compiler your users have.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>SPA Cambridge Talk - Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/10/29/spa-cambridge-talk-windows-presentation.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-29T20:51:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-10-29:blog/2007/10/29/spa-cambridge-talk-windows-presentation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The latest SPA Cambridge talk is coming on the 14th November, follow the &lt;a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/WindowsPresentationFoundation"&gt;link here to sign up&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a platform for building Windows desktop applications that can take full advantage of the graphical capabilities of modern PCs. Whereas many UI frameworks in the past have merely added yet another layer of abstraction on what was there before, WPF is radically different from its predecessors. This talk will discuss what possessed Microsoft to abandon the strategy of incremental tinkering that has served them well for over 20 years of Windows application development. WPF shifts away from many of the fundamental mechanisms that had been in place since the first version of Windows, and we will explore the new possibilities this creates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Speaker Biography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Griffiths is an independent WPF consultant, developer, speaker and Pluralsight instructor and a widely recognized expert on the subject. He lives in London but can often be found on various developer mailing lists and newsgroups, where a popular sport is to see who can get him to write the longest email in reply to the shortest possible question. Ian maintains a &lt;a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/"&gt;popular blog&lt;/a&gt; and is co-author of "Windows Forms in a Nutshell" and of "Mastering Visual Studio .NET".&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>ACCU Cambridge Talk - Agile Development</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/10/25/accu-cambridge-talk-agile-development.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-25T20:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-10-25:blog/2007/10/25/accu-cambridge-talk-agile-development.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thursday 1st November is the next &lt;a href="http://www.accu.org"&gt;ACCU&lt;/a&gt; Cambridge talk.

We use it on quite a strict level even after bolting it on to a legacy code-base.  There are some tools to make your life a little easier when using it from &lt;a href="http://www.riverblade.co.uk/"&gt;Riverblade Software&lt;/a&gt;.  Gimpel Lint is not a perfect tool for an IDE as it is commandline based and these types of checks should honestly be part of a good quality compiler as additional warning levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have found out though is that in Visual Studio Team System there is a static code analysis tool that isn't even available in the Professional version.  It's internally called PREFast at Microsoft and apparently they use it to ensure code quality.  Apparently in the Windows Driver Development Kit (WDK) it is available so it is possible to use that to do some code analysis.  Check out &lt;a href="http://buildingsecurecode.blogspot.com/2007/08/security-code-scanning-with-microsoft.html"&gt;this blog post for instructions&lt;/a&gt;.  There are plenty of blog posts about it on the rest of Steve Dispensa's blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a small Microsoft Research Article available &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/displayArticle.aspx?id=634"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about PREFast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've downloaded VS Team System to give it a go and to see how good it is.

But it is much more than that, it also has a built-in wiki, source browser, and project management through the ticketing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a really decent tool for make developer's lives much easier and it looks nice too.  As you start doing more with it you can really see the power in there.  You can work out a roadmap/timeline from your tickets and also generate changelogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all this isn'y new to the world out there, what I discovered today was &lt;a href="http://trac-hacks.org/"&gt;Trac Hacks&lt;/a&gt; which is a repository of Trac add-ins and enhancements.  There is a &lt;a href="http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/PeerReviewPlugin"&gt;code review plug-in&lt;/a&gt;, a blog plug-in, and simply too many others to list.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the point I discovered hand editing the solution files is the only way to maintain consistency and accuracy of the builds.  This is because the ue interface provided is antiquated, a struggle, and worst of all, unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build systems are really separated into two camps, text file based, or IDE based.  The text file based ones give you the most control and flexibility, but in this day and age it is a real shame that they are the most useful.  Also you may need an unknown macro language and will probably need to know every compiler setting that you want to set.  The IDE based ones tend to require manual intervention in some undocumented or badly documented file format. This immediately negates any advantage you previously had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am amazed these parts of the IDE have been so neglected since without it you will not get predictable results.  You want easy ways to compare different configurations or projects to see if they are out of step.  There is also no way of batching changes to a set of projects (you can get some sort of batch changes with configurations although you are not really sure of what you are doing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe there is a better way?  I don't know what else there is out there apart from premake systems (eg, CMake, Premake), script based build systems (eg, make, Boost.Build), and IDE based systems (Visual Studio et al).   You almost want the equivalent of the Apple stye reimagining for debugging/profiling like &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/developer/xray.html"&gt;XRay in the upcoming OS X Leopard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I am dead proud of recently is the one touch build release kit from within the Visual Studio IDE.  This means you just need to hit build and at the end you get an installer exe with no need for any jumping through hoops.  It would be nice if you didn't need really work hard to get to that stage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>C++ and 64-bits</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/10/14/c-and-64-bits.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-14T21:01:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-10-14:blog/2007/10/14/c-and-64-bits.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When pursuing the development of a 64-bit native program you realise that everything is not what you thought it was.  Somehow I had convinced myself of the wrong sizes for the built in types.  This wasn't due to ignorance but due to the plethora of 64-bit implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd somehow convinced myself the data model I was programming to was ILP64, but for Windows as it turns out uses LLP64.  Normally you don't discover it until you get to the point your program collapses in a heap under heavy load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some relevant articles &lt;a href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article2419.asp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/64bitPorting/transition/chapter_3_section_5.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/Test_64-bit_applications.asp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/20ISSUES64BIT.asp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I thought I would share some of the more insane things I have heard in the world of computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;No Source Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's amazing to think that a company can get away without source control, let alone a company supplying closed-source library functionality.  This meant that regressions happened at an alarming rate and a bugfix could result in previous bugfixes being undone.  The "repository" was a copy of the source code on a server and developers would copy the files to their computer, edit them, and then copy the changed files back to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;C# Developers Must Be Expensive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it easier to maintain a product when it is written in C# but you have lots of Visual Basic developers, convert the product to VB...  This was apparently done by taking the semi-colons off of the end of the lines then compiling to see where the errors are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the process is completely insane and devoid of any merit.  First you do not understand the code, this will adversely effect bugfixing.  I am sure that the fallout from that kind of development will be felt for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Visual Sourcesafe Is Fine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easiest to witness the insanity of using Visual Sourcesafe from the sane world of proper revision control systems.  Sourcesafe does not give any data integrity, can lose stuff, is impossible to script in any meaningful fashion, has a terrible architecture, and more...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am talking about v6.0 and older here (I have no idea about the package that has inherited the name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see things like source control as integral to the development experience and productivity of your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Phantom Build System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A developer on their own work computer has the only scripts that run the build kit.  Once that person leaves noone can do it and there is nothing to reverse engineer from.  It then takes perseverance and a small amount of brilliance to get to a working release installation kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVERYTHING to build your program should be well documented and under source control as much as possible.  It should be able to be run from any computer following the written instructions.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>SPA Cambridge Talk - Test Driven Development</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/10/13/spa-cambridge-talk-test-drive.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-13T09:27:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-10-13:blog/2007/10/13/spa-cambridge-talk-test-drive.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After an extended summer break the &lt;a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge"&gt;SPA Cambridge talks&lt;/a&gt; are back.

Thee events are organised by Mark Dalgarno and you can &lt;a href="http://blog.software-acumen.com/"&gt;read his blog here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month's talk was about Test Driven Development by Ivan Moore.  It was an interactive session requiring a laptop and Eclipse.  Unfortunately I discovered I must have the only copy of Eclipse in existence not set up for Java development (I have used it for Python and C/C++) a bit too late to rectify that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercise was to solve a blocks world problem with test driven development.  We used Java and JMock for this.  I also got to show my Java ineptitude since I haven't used it for 7 years properly, so I was learning on the fly.  To be honest now I go back to Java it is a lot more inelegant than I remember.  At least after all that I managed to get the tests to pass...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactive sessions are a bit more fun when you are sharing a computer, especially when all three of us huddled around it have very little practical Java experience.&lt;/p&gt;

It was very kindly hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.displaylink.com/"&gt;Displaylink&lt;/a&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk was about dynamic languages concentrating mainly on &lt;a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/"&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt;.  It is a dynamic language which is compiled into JVM bytecode meaning it can interact very nicely with Java.  What was particularly refreshing about his talk was Russel not talking about language wars but how they can cooperate together.  Overall the talk was entertaining and informative especially from the point of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)"&gt;Closures&lt;/a&gt; which I really needed to learn about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously the pub visit afterwards was essential.&lt;/p&gt;

Up until a couple of weeks ago I had some misconceptions about virtualisation.  I've used it through VMWare and have viewed it as a way to have a virtual layer on top of your processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then some concepts coalesced from various articles I was reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtualisation is the abstraction of resources away from their use.  At the moment the most common use of virtualisation would be memory.  You get a virtual address space from your operating system - this can be mad up of RAM, ROM, cache, hard drive, flash memory, and probably more.  You don't know what you are accessing but the virtualisation of those resources and their access makes it easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the catalysts for my understanding was iD Software new iD Tech 5.  There was mention of Megtexture which was texture virtualisation allowing the use of massive amounts of textures for the rendering.  This would no doubt be a way of not needing to know about the basic building blocks of the textures, but to use them through a virtualised interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then this comes to the processor virtualisation.  My misconception was because of the examples I had seen from Parallels and VMWare.  It allows you to run multiple computers on a single processor.  But what processor virtualisation should do is abstract away the processor resources allowing the program to run.  This would mean that you would not care about multiple cores or even computers, you could in their run one virtual machine which has a backend of a massive cluster of computers.  I don't know if this is the case yet as when you do parallel processing you still nee to know too much about the parallelism in order to develop a solution but I imagine some solutions must be able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - MFC v9 - Visual Studio 2008</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/10/03/gui-toolkits-mfc-v9-visual-studio-2008.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-03T18:45:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-10-03:blog/2007/10/03/gui-toolkits-mfc-v9-visual-studio-2008.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a sad thing to get me excited but Microsoft seems to have been keeping something up its sleeve for Visual Studio 2008.

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out they have a massive update for MFC dropping for Visual Studio 2008.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: This session will demonstrate the new features added to MFC in Visual Studio 2008, including support for Vista Common Dialogs, Vista Common Controls, the Microsoft Office 2007 Look and Feel (including support for an Office Ribbon style interface), Office and Visual Studio style Docking Toolbars and Tabbed Documents. We will also talk about our plans to evolve the MFC library for Visual C++ 10 and beyond. This is an in-depth session designed for experienced C++/MFC programmers. (C)   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do a search for the speaker &lt;a href="http://www.mseventseurope.com/OnlinePub/Public/sessions.aspx?EventId=HbLEvtKcPE4%3d"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it looks like the people using MFC will be getting some very powerful UI features as standard.  I'm not so bothered about Vista standard controls but more powerful docking would be very nice and would go hand in hand with tabbed document interfaces.  The most exciting part is the Office 2007 look 'n' feel along with the ribbon user interface (is it RibbonBar? I don't know...).  I guess we will find out more in November but this is good news for people maintaining MFC systems.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - MFC v9 - Visual Studio 2008</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/10/03/gui-toolkits-mfc-v9-visual-studio-2008.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-03T18:45:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-10-03:blog/2007/10/03/gui-toolkits-mfc-v9-visual-studio-2008.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a sad thing to get me excited but Microsoft seems to have been keeping something up its sleeve for Visual Studio 2008.

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking abut which way to jump with trying to write a toolkit.  First of all what should it be based on?  Should it just wrap Win32?  Cocoa?  Should it be entirely implemented on top of OpenGL from scratch?  Should it be cross-platform in design?  Just these questions could cause anyone to run away screaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about building it on top of OpenGL I encountered a couple of interesting GUI libraries &lt;a href="http://glui.sourceforge.net/"&gt;GLUI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://glow.sourceforge.net/"&gt;GLOW&lt;/a&gt;.  In these projects the windows are completely rendered by OpenGL which is an interesting approach.  I suppose &lt;a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/"&gt;Juce&lt;/a&gt; is built from similar roots as well where it implements its own toolkits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about writing a nice C++ wrapper for Win32 but then I started to think even Microsoft products don't use the standard widget rendering.  Then you start to think about built in custom drawn widget rendering, then you think why are you using standard widgets...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole idea about implementing a simple GUI toolkit is an education about the design decisions and pitfalls that you can get into.  You also need to decide which subset you decide to implement first.  The problem is most toolkits go for the same 10% and that is normally as far as they get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea I want to try out for an experimental GUI toolkit is some DSL (domain specific language).  What I mean is embedding a language in C++ in order to implement the user interface in a readable fashion.  It is certainly possible using modern C++ idioms as demonstrated in Boost.  I suppose the type of thing I want to do is (in some kid of C++ like pseudo code):
&lt;pre&gt;
dialog(...) +
widget&lt;static&gt;("Number", sizeX, sizeY) | widget&lt;edit&gt;(RESIZE_X) ||
widget&lt;static&gt;("Name", sizeX, sizeY)   | widget&lt;edit&gt;(RESIZE_X) ||
widget&lt;list&gt;("Blah", sizeX, sizeY, RESIZE_XY)
;
toolbar() +
button("image1", ...) |
button("image2", ...) |
separator() |
button("image3", ...) |
button("image4", ...)
;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Complete and utter insanity?  Probably, but could be fun to try out.  It would certainly be something different and would create a parallel in your source in comparison to what you would see on screen.  I don't think anything quit like it has been tried before, so feel free to steal the idea - it would save me implementing it(!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough rambling for today I think...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>One Year Old</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/10/01/one-year-old.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-01T16:47:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-10-01:blog/2007/10/01/one-year-old.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's hard to believe this blog has been going for one year as of today.  I can't believe I actually remembered this since I never managed to spot my 100th or 200th post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been quite a year really.  NC Graphics were taken over by PTC meaning I am now with a third employer working on the same codebase (in four separate stints).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly the most popular items on the blog have been the &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/07/tortoisesvn-and-visual-studio.html"&gt;TortoiseSVN and Visual Studio integration&lt;/a&gt; and recently the &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/08/debugging-stlport-in-visual-studio.html"&gt;STLPort debugging in Visual Studio&lt;/a&gt;.  Thanks to all the readers and all the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would promise something for the next year or some manifesto, but if it is as action packed as the previous year I somehow doubt I will live up to it.  All I can promise is  if I learn anything interesting about computers I will share it with the rest of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

There hasn't been much focus on the native C++ side of the IDE for a while, which means it does lack some useful features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those tools available for free on the internet is &lt;a href="http://www.cupla.net/CodeWiz2/"&gt;CodeWiz2&lt;/a&gt; providing a number of very quick and simple additions to the IDE which makes coding a bit easier.  Friend File lets you switch between header and implementation and Friend Member lets you switch between declaration and definition for a single function.  I did have a script that did it, but this works much better (and will at least work on Vista as well since the Macro Explorer was broken last time I tried).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also scriptable in a manner of speaking meaning you can get common code structures or comments at the tap of a button.  Oh yeah, did I mention it is free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another free tool available for Visual C++ is &lt;a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/RefactorCPP/"&gt;Refactor!&lt;/a&gt; which you will be surprised to hear offers refactoring for C++.  Only the simplest functionality is available in the free version but it is quite interesting.  I tend to refactor by hand myself, but one useful side-effect of this plug-in is when it highlights all instances of a variable which helps make the code a bit easier to navigate (and should really be a basic feature of the IDE).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - The Forgotten Part Of My Blog</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/09/26/gui-toolkits-forgotten-part-of-my-blog.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-26T19:59:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-09-26:blog/2007/09/26/gui-toolkits-forgotten-part-of-my-blog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been doing this blog nearly a year now and certainly in 2007 I have neglected GUI coverage.  The main problem is that there hasn't been a huge amount of impressive work on the open-source front and those libraries that showed the most promise are languishing in Sourceforge hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Winforms has caught on big-style?  Maybe, but as far as I can tell when you get down to the OS level it still amounts to Win32 function calls, it is just the framework is built on top of that.  Also, many more applications can now be run as web-based applications, with its own plethora of GUI toolkits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qt is obviously the leader but is only open-source for open-source applications unfortunately (and quite rightly as they do deserve to make money off it).  wxWidgets is not making as massive strides as many would have hoped in order to have really good looking native Windows applications.  The most recent substantial addition was wxAUI that added lots of good stuff like docking.  None of the ideas floating around Boost got off the ground unfortunately, and Win32GUI Generics and Notus and many others are mothballed.  Maybe there needs to be a "State Of The GUI Union" post...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of doing a small GUI toolkit just to test out the theories and get a better appreciation of the difficulties involved in design and implementation.  It would also mean I could play around with some of my memory allocation and multithreading ideas as part of it.  I've been trying to pull together as much information about Win32 as posible and I'll definitely put them all together in one article.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>ACCU Cambridge Talk - October</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/09/26/accu-cambridge-talk-october.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-26T19:48:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-09-26:blog/2007/09/26/accu-cambridge-talk-october.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's hard to believe it is nearly October.

Presenting the talk was Peter Smith who is part of the linker team at &lt;a href="http://www.arm.com/"&gt;ARM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Missing Link talk was about the role of the linker in software development.  The talk detailed the history, the design of, and the use of linkers.  The talk was about an hour long but could easily have gone on longer.  Certainly from the tak I got the impression that the linker is a rather unloved part of the compilation process.  In fact there is really only one book about linkers called "Linkers and Loaders" which is available online from &lt;a href="http://www.iecc.com/linker/"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk itself was entertaining and was at a suitably high level for everyone to understand.   The actual architecture of compilation and linking really has not changed to much throughout its history.  Some of the more interesting parts of the talk were the discussions about name mangling and the reasoning behind it, and the caveats that need to be implemented to get around things like templates in C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is a plan for the slides to be available online via the &lt;a href="http://www.accu.org"&gt;ACCU website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always though after the event you can learn lots more by going to the pub. A good turnout for the pub was the icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

It details alterations to the STL that Electronic Arts implemented (as well as their own version of the STL) to meet its requirements for standard containers and algorithms.  It has been published on the &lt;a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2363.html"&gt;C++ standardisation website&lt;/a&gt; as a reference paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the ideas in it are very interesting and some are a little naive and lack generality, but the document itself is thoroughly worth it.  The main thrust of the document is efficiency in terms of memory and speed.  This amounts to better allocators, better control of low-level memory (alignment and so on) and intrusive type containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It covers the deficiencies of std::allocator for EA's requirements like the copy semantics and the lack of alignment controls.  It has got me thinking there is a lack of a generic allocator framework that makes it easier for writing pluggable allocators that could be thread local, or global, or thread-safe, or instance-based.  But I'll come back to that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vector bool is not a bit-based array but there is an implementation of a bitvector that gives the same behaviour.  That makes sense to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to resize a containers capacity to a smaller size and for the storage to respect that as most STL implementations do not do this.  Means memory can be returned back to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the implementation is easy to debug through a simple debugger with no overhead.  I don't know whether that is the case in reality but it certainly has its appeal, but I'm sure it would make plenty of sense in open-source implementations meaning there would be more people able to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently some compilers struggle with inlining so the implementation reduces code complexity to allow less able compilers to inline more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the motivation behind this is cross-platform in nature and part of that is that the platforms can be limited in memory and processing power.  Some of the ideas brought up are possible in the current STL framework with some minor jumping through hoops, fortunately EA expended the manpower on implementing exactly what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now back to the allocators...  The ideas make &lt;a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=27220&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=eastl&amp;start=25"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;a lot of sense in this document and I wonder how many are available to coders from the current STL framework.  One thing that requires clarity is what the alignment needs in order to align, by this I mean is it easily determined from the type you are using or is it a combination of that and the machine type.  If so some of the work could be done via type traits like those available through Boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the allocator type suggestions do not even have an easy to use reference implementation in the open-source world.  Allocators are so important but there is a lack of availability of those apart from simple HOWTOs for writing allocators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has got me thinking about actually writing some.  Coming up with a good framework has lead me to reading big stacks of articles online about allocators, and I think there is a good way forward but 'll leave that to another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is some additional discussion on the Ogre forums &lt;a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=35473&amp;view=previous&amp;sid=ce193664e1d3d7c4af509e6f4e2718c6"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=225568&amp;sid=ce193664e1d3d7c4af509e6f4e2718c6"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Upcoming Computing Talks In Cambridge</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/09/04/upcoming-computing-talks-in-cambridge.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-04T19:36:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-09-04:blog/2007/09/04/upcoming-computing-talks-in-cambridge.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of talks coming up in Cambridge in the next couple of weeks.

I  have expended quite a lot of energy trying to get the Microsoft STL to speed up more, with custom allocators and the suchlike.  The reason I pursued it was to make debugging easier as there was no way (by default) to look inside the containers in a structured fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I realised I was approaching the problem from the wrong angle.  Perhaps Visual Studio allows us to customise the debugging visualisations, and that means using STLPort with all the debugging benefits of the in-built system.  This was where I discovered the &lt;a href="http://www.developer.com/net/cplus/article.php/3509761"&gt;autoexp.dat&lt;/a&gt; which is more or less undocumented by Microsoft.  The system allows you to create custom visualisers for any datatype in the debugger.  Unfortunately it requires arcane rituals to make it work and I believe the format may have changed for VS2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway on to the meat of this post!  I will post here the code you need to visualise map, vector, set, and list in Visual Studio 2005.  First go and open &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\Packages\Debugger\autoexp.dat&lt;/span&gt; in a text editor.

&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure I need to do some more tweaking to get it working even better.  The map implementation is certainly the best part as it displays the list of items as pairs of (key, value) which is really useful.  Some of the code for this was pilfered from the comments of &lt;a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=120"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; - thanks to those people who blazed the initial trail.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Lots of source code - GUIs and MFC</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/08/25/lots-of-source-code-guis-and-mfc.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-08-25T15:42:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-08-25:blog/2007/08/25/lots-of-source-code-guis-and-mfc.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been difficult to find the time to blog recently, but this news is really interesting.  One of the MFC extension toolkits &lt;a href="http://www.theultimatetoolbox.com/products/ultimatetoolbox/"&gt;Ultimate Toolbox&lt;/a&gt; has decided to give away its product for free on the &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/"&gt;CodeProject&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides MFC extensions for more modern looking MFC applications like the Office 2003 theme and spiffing looking menus and tabbed interfaces.  The CodeProject now gives full access to the source code and all the articles are very useful for explaining how to use it.  This isn't only the Toolbox (MFC classes) but also the Ultimate Grid (spreadsheet type interface) and Ultimate TCP/IP (networking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code is out there now hoping the community can take it on and then develop it further.  Unfortunately there are none of the cutting edge features like Vista support or ribbons but I bet the framework makes it much easier to develop than pure MFC.&lt;/p&gt;

It provides an installer with Eclipse, the compiler and loads of exras.  The plan is to create a really good Windows desktop IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on it over the next few weeks as it should be updating to GCC 4.2.1 and some form of &lt;a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org"&gt;wxWidgets&lt;/a&gt; support.&lt;/p&gt;

The catalyst for this is the release of Visual Studio 2008 (formally codename Orcas) Beta 2, and making sure I can still play with Subversion through the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have made a new distribution ZIP file with a few more configurations inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/Subversion.zip"&gt;Download it here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a few more features than before including some for dealing with conflicts.  The distribution itself has a few more files so you can decide whether you want to just have the menus, toolbars or context menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1xvreyfQ6ns/Rq5I_talWbI/AAAAAAAAAAM/55l1sNrJM7o/s1600-h/Toolbar.png"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1xvreyfQ6ns/Rq5I_talWbI/AAAAAAAAAAM/55l1sNrJM7o/s320/Toolbar.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093088487962663346" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Supported operations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following Subversion/TortoiseSVN features are covered in the integration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Commit&lt;/span&gt; - Commit the files to the repository&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Update&lt;/span&gt; - Update the current working version&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;History&lt;/span&gt; - Get the history for the selected file&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Diff&lt;/span&gt; - Get the diff compared to the base version&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Blame&lt;/span&gt; - Find out who committed the crimes in the file&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Revert&lt;/span&gt; - Undo changes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Modifications&lt;/span&gt; - Check to see if any files have been modified&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Edit Conflicts&lt;/span&gt; - Edit the conflicts that arise from merging/updating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Resolve&lt;/span&gt; - Mark the file as resolved for conflicts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Repository&lt;/span&gt; - View the repository on the server&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Project History&lt;/span&gt; - Get the history of the entire project&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Add Solution&lt;/span&gt; - Add the solution being edited to source control&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Branch/Tag&lt;/span&gt; - Perform a branch or tag operation on the current working copy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Settings&lt;/span&gt; - Set up TortoiseSVN&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;SubversionInstall.vbs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simply installs a set of External Tools into Visual Studio for common TortoiseSVN operations.  It can be installed on versions above Visual Studio.NET (version 7.0).  Currently it is configured for Visual Studio 2008 (version 9.0), to make it work on other versions change the variable "strVisualStudioVersionNumber" as outlined in the file's comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you have installed TortoiseSVN in a non-default location, make sure that you change the variable "strTortoiseSVNBin" to the correct binary path.  Make sure that the backslashes are doubled up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;SubversionMenu.vssettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This adds a menu to the IDE for TortoiseSVN with the appropriate icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;SubversionMenuToolbar.vssettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This adds a menu for TortoiseSVN as well as a toolbar using the appropriate icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;SubversionMenuToolbarContexts.vssettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This adds not only the menu and toolbar, but also adds the items to the appropriate context menus for files and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;SubversionMenuToolbarContextsVS2005.vssettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides the menu, toolbar and context menus for TortoiseSVN in Visual Studio 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there is no good solution for file renaming (I always do it through Windows Explorer) since this integration uses the External tools and allows for it to work in Visual Studio Express.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>C Front-End For LLVM Open-Sourced</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/07/25/c-front-end-for-llvm-open-sourced.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-07-25T20:59:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-07-25:blog/2007/07/25/c-front-end-for-llvm-open-sourced.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I covered &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/07/llvm-low-level-virtual-machine.html"&gt;LLVM briefly earlier&lt;/a&gt;.

Intel describe it as a "rich and complete approach to expressing parallelism in a C++ program".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With multi-threading in general being so immature when looking at other libraries, another solution can never hurt.  So add it to Boost.Threads, OpenMP, wxThread and the myriad of others.  Admittedly the way that all of the alternatives work is very low-level and means very careful design is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm interested to see the approach of the library to multi-threading as it looks quite complicated to wrap your head around.  The best bit though is there is apparently a cache aligned memory allocator as part of it that can be used independently.&lt;/p&gt;

The web has been down at work for over 24 hours.  I now realise it is 100% essential for my job.  Google has replaced a certain portion of my brain....  I can't answer any questions without it (okay, a slight exaggeration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tool I have now found indispensable now is &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/"&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;.  Up until recently I have used the Google Browser Sync for using my bookmarks at multiple locations.  The problem I found is I am very selective about what I bookmark as current bookmarking UIs available in IE and FireFox do not scale very well.  Then I get in the situation I haven' bookmarked something and I spend ages on Google tryin to find it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to move to del.ico.us as there was a &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615"&gt;new tool for Firefox&lt;/a&gt; which replaces the bookmarking system in Firefox, so now I use it exclusively tagging webpages at will.  Obviously the number of bookmarks I have is increasing rapidly especially since I can even tag individual articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see on the sidebar you can see what I am currently bookmarking and what I have bookmarked.  I have also added the ability to bookmark individual articles quickly if you want.  I tend to find most web technologies a bit hollow (MySpace Facebook and the suchlike) but this is a tool that reallyhelps make the web a better place, and all users of the system are sharing what they know with their bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Great Free Software - MacPorts</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/07/17/great-free-software-macports.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-07-17T19:21:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-07-17:blog/2007/07/17/great-free-software-macports.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since getting my Macbook Pro one of the most useful pieces of software I have installed is &lt;a href="http://www.macports.org/"&gt;MacPorts&lt;/a&gt;.

One of which is the Visual Studio integration and recently there has been a status update on the mailing list talking about progress - &lt;a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/bazaar/2007q3/027836.html"&gt;read it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the distributed source control system that catches on will probably be the one which manages to get together the best external tools and UI.  Bazaar seems to have a few projects that are actively developed that could deal with that and make it quite a contender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the development for this project though is wrapping the API in a Microsoft embeddable way.  An interesting approach but I can think of a few other routes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Distributed Revision Control And APIs</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/07/16/distributed-revision-control-and-apis.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-07-16T21:33:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-07-16:blog/2007/07/16/distributed-revision-control-and-apis.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons blogging has been quiet the past week or so is I've been fiddling about with some coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been trying out &lt;a href="http://www.wxpython.org"&gt;wxPython&lt;/a&gt; and using it as an interface to a distributed source control system.  It's purely experimental, but it did show me some deficiencies and strengths in some of the ones available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I learnt though...  wxPython is a great way of hacking together a coherent UI fast, I am still relatively inexperienced in Python and wxPython but the resources out there on the Internet are very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the source control systems...  First I tried out &lt;a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/"&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt;, but I am really struggling with the API and trying to write extensions.  This is mainly due to the lack of documentation, and a lot of current tools like &lt;a href="http://qct.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Qct&lt;/a&gt; simply parse the commandline.  I did work out some of the parts of the API to wrap, but I found it hard going with limited Python knowledge and a lack of comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other system I tried was &lt;a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/"&gt;Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; which I found a very different experience.  The API is excellently documented and the plug-in API is excellent.  Admittedly the criticism levelled at this source contrl system is the speed, but it gets so much right.  It is built on a solid foundation of correctness and the barrier for entry is lowered thanks to the excellent documentation.  I managed o get a working status dialog up and running in a very short period of time (although admittedly I got sidetracked afterwards fiddling around with wxPython).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I was using wxPython is that it looks native on my Macbook Pro as a lot of the available UIs are GTK based meaning they look pretty bad on OS X.  Also I wanted to try it out on Windows which meant it looked pretty good on that platform as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I can find the time to tidy some of this code up into a reusable form and actually see something like at least the status and commit dialogs through to completion.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Distributed Revision Control Redux</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/07/06/distributed-revision-control-redux.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-07-06T22:01:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-07-06:blog/2007/07/06/distributed-revision-control-redux.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Leading on from my previous posts &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/06/tortoises-are-coming.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/06/distributed-revision-control-mercurial.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;  I have been doing a lot of research into the distributed revision control arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly I have got fixated on three, &lt;a href="http://git.or.cz/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/"&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/"&gt;Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;.  All three projects are about the same age, but each have their own strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly to sum them up Git is fast, it has a large developer community behind it and seems to be developing at breakneck speed.  The disadvantages are mainly due to the reliance on the POSIX systems which means cross-platform (well, Windows) support is weak.  I know there are some initiatives to get it working on Windows but I can see it losing steam as there is not enough interest in it due to the POSIX platform supports being so strong.  Also, Git is a bit more obscure than the others due to being a bit more low-level with plug-ins adding the ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercurial is written is Python and is easily cross-platform  It is much simpler than the aforementioned Git to use and is close to it in speed and storage.  The disadvantages which I must admit are not many are that the community is not as fast moving as Git, but new versions are very regular.  I do see this as a better prospect than Git as it is better designed whereas as better design is being retroactively added to Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bazaar (Bazaar NG to give it its full name) is sponsored by &lt;a href="http://www.canonical.com/"&gt;Canonical&lt;/a&gt;, the company running Ubuntu.  Mark Shuttleworth has blogged about Bazaar recently which I mentioned in a previous post.  Bazaar is also written in Python and is cross-platform with a nice Windows installer for those people scared of installing Python.  It is very well designed with comprehensive renaming and merge support.  The main disadvantage is that it is not as fast as Mercurial or Git.  To be honest I am taking a liking to this system and have been investigating it quite deeply (but that is for another post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three young projects are really progressing fast though and they are already good enough to use providing you are not too tied to your current extras from more mature systems (like TortoiseSVN).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Eclipse CDT For Windows</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/07/02/eclipse-cdt-for-windows.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-07-02T07:35:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-07-02:blog/2007/07/02/eclipse-cdt-for-windows.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; IDE (which is cross-platform and designed to have plug-ins written for) has a good C++ module called &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/"&gt;CDT&lt;/a&gt; (C/C++ Development Toolkit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently version &lt;a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help33/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/concepts/cdt_c_whatsnew.htm"&gt;4.0 was released&lt;/a&gt; in tandem with the &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20070627_europarelease.php"&gt;Europa release of Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;.

It provides a back-end for compilers to allow for optimisation for the entire lifetime of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GLSL in Mesa has been implemented using LLVM.  You can read a little about it &lt;a href="http://zrusin.blogspot.com/2007/05/mesa-and-llvm.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The OpenGL implementation in &lt;a href="http://macslash.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/18/1248220"&gt;Mac OSX Leopard will be implemented using LLVM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting article &lt;a href="http://cliffhacks.blogspot.com/2007/03/experimenting-with-llvm.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about the speed of LLVM.  It is surprising how close it gets in speed as things currently stand to GCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently there was a development meeting for LLVM in May and the presentations are available &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2007-05/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Of particular interest is the presentation by Apple about a new C front-end for LLVM called Clang with plans to support Objective C and C++.  You can read the slides &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2007-05/09-Naroff-CFE.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and see the presentation &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2007-05/09-Naroff-CFE.mov"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The new frontend is called Clang and probably won't be production ready for a while but it is interesting to see where compiler technologies are heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting area of LLVM is definitely the whole program optimisation potential of it.  Anyone who has seen the performance gains from using it knows this is good thing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GPLv3 Released</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/06/29/gplv3-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-06-29T19:55:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-06-29:blog/2007/06/29/gplv3-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;GPL v3 has been released today.

I've been looking more closely at these shttp://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gifystems and thinking about how they fit in to the different development methods (closed and open source don't normally need the same process).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly there is a talk at Google from last year by one of the main developers Bryan O'Sullivan on Google Video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-7724296011317502612&amp;#038;hl=en" flashvars=""&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 0.9.4 of Mercurial was released today adding a fair amount of bugfixes and new functionality.  It is a very interesting system as it is implemented in Python, is very efficient and is one of the best for cross platform support out of the distributed revision control systems (with an extension adding the support for Windows file endings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commandline syntax is simple and easy to use.  It has a wide variety of additional tools and extensions.  Although these are not as mature or in-depth as other systems (like Subversion/CVS/and so on) they are providing a good basis.  Quite a few large projects are using Mercurial in production like Mozilla, OpenSolaris, Xine, and Xen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great book about using Mercurial &lt;a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It covers many of the concepts and simply how to use it.  The wiki based website and the mailing lists are also great sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be lots of GUI tools but none providing full workflow support yet, but hopefully this will happen with time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The Tortoises Are Coming</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/06/22/tortoises-are-coming.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-06-22T21:36:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-06-22:blog/2007/06/22/tortoises-are-coming.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Before I start I just want to say thanks to all the people leaving comments.  This post actually comes out of what Frabcus has left in the comments about distributed revision control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been having a serious look into all the distributed revision control systems out there (well, the free ones at least) not only to understand the concepts of them but to see how easy they would be to use since they tend to lack the UI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly Mark Shuttleworth, Ubuntu founder has been discussing distributed revision control on his blog.  There are four posts &lt;a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/123"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/124"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/125"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/126"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now to the subject of this post, the Tortoises.  First there was &lt;a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/"&gt;TortoiseCVS&lt;/a&gt; which interestingly was started by an ex-NC Graphics employee &lt;a href="http://www.flourish.org/"&gt;Francis Irving&lt;/a&gt;.  Then there is obviously &lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/"&gt;TortoiseSVN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for these new distributed systems it looks like they are racing for Tortoise type implementations of user interfaces on Windows which would help to attract Windows developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="http://tortoisedarcs.sourceforge.net/"&gt;TortoiseDarcs&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://darcs.net"&gt;Darcs&lt;/a&gt;.  This is the most complete implementation for the distributed systems so far.  There are some good &lt;a href="http://tortoisedarcs.sourceforge.net/screenshots/screenshots.html"&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt; on the TortoiseDarcs website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/"&gt;Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; (run by Canonical of Ubuntu fame and what Mark Shuttleworth was talking about on his blog) there is &lt;a href="http://www.hl.id.au/Projects/tortoisebzr/"&gt;TortoiseBzr&lt;/a&gt;.  It is using TortoiseCVS as a base to expand from.  There is also a placeholder on the wiki for Visual Studio integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/"&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt; there was an announcement on their mailing list that someone has started on &lt;a href="http://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2007-April/012923.html"&gt;Tortoise-hg&lt;/a&gt; and they ave a small set of functionality.  It hasn't been publicly released yet, but hopefully soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no TortoiseGit being looked at, but I think the Windows support requires work before that step is taken I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Some Free Merge Tools</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/06/21/some-free-merge-tools.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-06-21T20:07:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-06-21:blog/2007/06/21/some-free-merge-tools.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've noticed a few commercial products have released free merge tools recently.  I'll come onto them after the good open-source ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a massive fan of &lt;a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/"&gt;KDiff3&lt;/a&gt; which provides a very good 3-way merge and has saved my merging hide more times than I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winmerge.org"&gt;WinMerge&lt;/a&gt; is definitely the slickest merge tool for Windows, unfortunately it is only a two-way merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://meld.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Meld&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent system but although it is cross-platform it really excels on GNOME.  The comparison looks great with the two sides connecting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now some commercial ones...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html"&gt;SourceGear DiffMerge 3.0&lt;/a&gt; was released recently.  Looks OK as well and it is cross-platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/products/merge.html"&gt;Perforce Merge Tool&lt;/a&gt; was recently released for free.

Basically he has an immense dislike of centralised revision control.  You can see Linus's talk here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/4XpnKHJAok8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Slashdot discussion is available at this &lt;a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/07/06/03/004214.shtml"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of sent me into an Internet whirlpool looking at distributed revision control.  So this post will be all about that.  I must admit I have never really thought about it since I am so pleased with &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/"&gt;TortoiseSVN&lt;/a&gt;, although recent events have made me look into source control systems in general more closely.  At a high-level the distributed model has a lot of advantages in design and is capable of having a "central" server you sync against which means it can behave more like the centralised model.  On the other hand the centralised tools all seem to have much easier to use tools and have more powerful features (at least in Subversion) than they are given credit for due to their heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla development has switched to a distributed source control system recently.  They had a set of requirements like cross-platform, speed, stability and more.  Some more information can be read &lt;a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/preed/2007/04/version_control_system_shootou_1.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://git.or.cz/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; was started by Linus Torvalds because he was no longer able to use BitKeeper.  It has quite poor Windows support because it is reliant on a POSIX system but has a lot of powerful features.  There are some UI projects but they seem quite immature at the moment and only augment the command ine rather than replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/"&gt;Mecurial&lt;/a&gt; was chosen by Mozilla development for their revision control system, and in fact they have already switched to it.  There are apparently some speed issues in comparison to Git, but it has better cross-platform support.  There seems to be a few extensions including some &lt;a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/"&gt;Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt; integration.  I am not too sure about the UI side yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other distributed source control systems include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/"&gt;Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; - is a GPL based system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://monotone.ca/"&gt;Monotone&lt;/a&gt; - is another GPL system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/view/HomePage"&gt;SVK&lt;/a&gt; - A Subversion derived distributed system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.darcs.net/"&gt;darcs&lt;/a&gt; - yet another system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway these distributed systems seem to be getting traction with Mozilla, X, and other large projects starting to use it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Write better code</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/05/31/write-better-code.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-05-31T19:50:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-05-31:blog/2007/05/31/write-better-code.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting talk on Slashdot about coding &lt;a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/07/05/30/1813247.shtml"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;For the beginners out there here is a link to a &lt;a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/"&gt;C++ tutorial&lt;/a&gt; which is quite well presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good resource for peer-reviewed C++ articles is the &lt;a href="http://www.artima.com/cppsource"&gt;C++ Source&lt;/a&gt; although there isn't a massive amount of recent content.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Future Developments - Subversion</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/05/23/future-developments-subversion.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-05-23T21:43:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-05-23:blog/2007/05/23/future-developments-subversion.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; is always a great choice for source control, and in the summer it looks like there will be an update to version 1.5 with some fairly major features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important of these features is the merge tracking which is detailed in &lt;a href="http://blogs.open.collab.net/svn/2007/05/the_subversion__1.html"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.  It is not a problem for a simple life of development, but when you are maintaining multiple branches with multiple requirements and they all need to know what revisions have an haven't been merged you really need to know what is going on.  With Subversion up until the upcoming 1.5 you would just have to be conscientious and meticulous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a list of all issue reports that are &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/buglist.cgi?component=subversion&amp;issue_status=NEW&amp;issue_status=STARTED&amp;issue_status=REOPENED&amp;target_milestone=1.5&amp;target_milestone=1.5-consider"&gt;targeted for Subversion 1.5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also for Subversion resources there is a great blog &lt;a href="http://svn-dev.blogspot.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which has more about what the developers are planning (or would like to ideally include).  You can see the Subversion roadmap &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/roadmap.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;It had lots of nice little features that people could use in their MFC apps.  Things like the flashy new icon menus and docking windows.  I found it a little heavy going looking at the code but it was interesting at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer of GuiToolkit has just published a new article called &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/library/PrettyWinApiClass.asp"&gt;Pretty WinAPI Class&lt;/a&gt; and covers a modern looking GUI interface by wrapping the Win32 API.  It has nice looking menus, docking windows and lots of other good looking tools.  The source looks very similar to MFC in some respects, but it seems to do the job nicely providing the "modern Windows look" since Microsoft does not see fit to provide the common controls for this in a lot of areas.&lt;/p&gt;

This is version 1.34 and you can read the changes on the &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/"&gt;Boost frontpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boost is a fantastic peer reviewed library collection for C++.  It adds power and robustness for C++ programmers, after all we shouldn't need to reinvent the wheel all of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are five new libraries:
     * Foreach Library:
         BOOST_FOREACH macro for easily iterating over the elements of a
         sequence, from Eric Niebler.
     * Statechart Library:
         Arbitrarily complex finite state machines can be implemented in
         easily readable and maintainable C++ code, from Andreas Huber.
     * TR1 Library:
         An implementation of the C++ Technical Report on Standard Library
         Extensions, from John Maddock.
         This library does not itself implement the TR1 components, rather
         it's a thin wrapper that will include your standard library's TR1
         implementation (if it has one), otherwise it will include the Boost
         Library equivalents, and import them into namespace std::tr1. Highlights
         include: Reference Wrappers, Smart Pointers, result_of,
         Function Object Binders, Polymorphic function wrappers, Type Traits,
         Random Number Generators and Distributions, Tuples, Fixed Size Array,
         Hash Function Objects, Regular Expressions and
         Complex Number Additional Algorithms.
     * Typeof Library:
         Typeof operator emulation, from Arkadiy Vertleyb and Peder Holt.
     * Xpressive Library:
         Regular expressions that can be written as strings or as expression
         templates, and that can refer to each other and themselves recursively
         with the power of context-free grammars, from Eric Niebler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously lots of the other libraries have been updated like Boost::Python.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>PTC Acquires NC Graphics</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/05/17/ptc-acquires-nc-graphics.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-05-17T17:09:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-05-17:blog/2007/05/17/ptc-acquires-nc-graphics.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason blogging has been so light in recent months is that work has been taking up more time than usual.

This has all been very tightly kept under wraps so it probably surprises quite a few people.  It has been surprising that noone in this entire period has asked me about it since CAM really is quite a small industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wxFormBuilder is easy to use, simple to look at, and provides a very decent set of features.  It is a standalone system that is simultaneously good and bad, goosd that it requires nothing else, bad because some people require IDE integration.  You can output the designs to XRC (the XML based resource language for wxWidgets) or to native C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see some screenshots of version 3.0 &lt;a href="http://wxformbuilder.org/?page_id=38"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The screenshots so some fairly interesting and complex designs demonstrating some of the power of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see their roadmap for features &lt;a href="http://issues.wxformbuilder.org/?do=roadmap&amp;project=1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  They use &lt;a href="http://flyspray.org/"&gt;flyspray&lt;/a&gt; for their bugtracker (which is a good system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is particularly nice about this program is the amount of GUI widgets it supports including the contributed ones like &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxflatnotebook"&gt;wxFlatNoteBook&lt;/a&gt;.

I am an idealist in that regard although I am willing to admit I fail to do enough about it (hopefully I will get around to changing that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My TortoiseSVN integration into Visual Studio is out there because I wanted people to not go through what I did to get it up and running.  Because the project that makes it possible is open-source, there is no reason I should keep something so trivial secret that makes it more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the war is about to begin.  Microsoft have declared that &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/"&gt;free software violates 235 of their software patents&lt;/a&gt;.  Microsoft are not specific beyond application areas like office applications or email.  The article itself is deliberately inflammatory, especially the choice of pictures and captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is merely a couple of days after &lt;a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/090507_Database/09May2007_data05.php"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; in which Microsoft declares that fee software does not exist.  In fact Bill Hilf (of Microsoft's Linux Lab) is so wide of the mark it is not funny.  He seems to equate people having jobs means that free software does not exist, and goes so far to say that there is no community when Microsoft are masters at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing"&gt;astroturfing&lt;/a&gt;.   For a start it is Open-Source software and free as in libre software, it is about &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;knowledge being free&lt;/span&gt;, not about the cost being nothing.  Sharing knowledge surely makes a better society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact Microsoft are deliberately framing the debate mainly focussing on trying to term it all "free software" and trying to make it mean what they say it means.  Microsoft are trying to create a public awareness of people sharing knowledge to create better software being a bad thing by making it sound like it does not really exist and is a corporate conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft are treading dangerous ground now because they are going to start alienating people.  Most importantly they will alienate some areas of the development community, I know I have no interest in contributing to anything Microsoft will do, and I plan to steer clear of things like .NET for philosophical reasons.  I started to use VS2005 Express because it is free, but all home development I do from now on will be using non-MS tools (hopefully GCC 4.2 will be out soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this does prove that the doomsayers from the Novell-Microsoft agreement were right on the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eben Moglen ( former general counsel to the Free Software Foundation) has given an &lt;a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39287036,00.htm"&gt;interview here&lt;/a&gt;.  He has been instrumental in getting GPLv3 together.  There is an interesting article about &lt;a href="http://www.itmanagersjournal.com/feature/23144"&gt;misconceptions about the GPLv3 licence here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I think the reason that I like Bugzilla so much is that it is a developer's bugtracker.  it is not the prettiest or simplest of the bugtrackers out there, but it has masses of useful features and is very configurable.

&lt;p&gt;It provides a suite of compilers from Fortran, to Java, to C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment for Windows unless you use Cygwin (not recommended) you will be using &lt;a href="http://www.mingw.org"&gt;MinGW&lt;/a&gt; which is currently at version 3.4.5, some way behind the version available on Unix systems (which is in 4.2 prerelease).  The good news is that once gcc 4.2 is released it will be released for MinGW, which should mean lots of good improvements, from standards compliance to OpenMP to speed ups from new optimisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously it does not only target specific OSes, but it also targets different platforms including 64-bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly it is not as fast the the Microsoft compilers, but maybe it will get there.

&lt;p&gt;Recently KDE successfully &lt;a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/188693/"&gt;transitioned to the new build system&lt;/a&gt; relatively painlessly, when the previous system was essentially unmaintainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hooks for testing regimes available from the main website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly from the Visual Studio viewpoint it would probably be a hard sell to others.  The main problem I have with Visual Studio is that it screws with the vcproj files massively on seemingly innocuous edits.

&lt;p&gt;It hasn't been developed for a very long time now (over a year) according to the website but looking at the CVS logs there were changes six months ago to the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is by no means a finished article but it has some interesting ideas (although it looks like it could e incredibly complicated thanks to lots of templates).  It is not as comprehensive as the other library that uses the same concepts &lt;a href="http://www.torjo.com/win32gui/"&gt;Win32 GUI Generics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polymorphism articles cover the use of templates to define interfaces and avoid inheritance.  It all looks very COM like...  There should be performance gains with this approach due to the lack of real vtables and the ability for the compiler to optimise much better due to the code being static at compile time.  Although, who knows how much gain there will be without proper testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other article is about using vector processing units to speed up computation.

Finding a good fit for your development process is a bonus, but sometimes you do have to alter your process slightly to get the most out of those tools.  One of the best out there is Bugzilla.  When working on a product of any size a good bug/request/task tracker is completely essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bugzilla is probably the best known bug tracker out there, but it simultaneously seems to have the Marmite effect on people.  It is a scalable, powerful, customisable system for managing a large amount of issues.  Certainly at some point in the development process you end up with more bugs than you know what to do with and it requires the ability to categorise and filter, this is where Bugzilla excels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently &lt;a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/"&gt;Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt; 3.0 Release Candidate 1 was made available.  It adds spades of functionality, like custom fields, read-only fields, an XML-RPC interface, and more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bugzilla provides a massive breadth and depth of functionality.  The bug reports provide loads of information by default, an you can switch off or add to those fields.  The main power of the system is the search facility, it is fully comprehensive and daunting to the first-time user.  Most people who dislike Bugzilla have an aversion to the search feature, but it allows you to save searches and perform boolean searches, and now with version 3.0 you can assign searches to groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a powerful group feature where if you are a member of a group the group has its own permissions and settings.  It allows you to provide levels like sales, support, development, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can generate reports via searches, but also there is a set of comprehensive graphical charts.  It allows for you to track fixes by version, or by product, or component, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is open-source with all the source code it allows you to make it do whatever you want with enough hard graft.  In a previous job I implemented a custom Bugzilla database (based on a beta version 2.18).  Basically it involved tidying up the UI, providing per report storage areas via FTP, and a couple more tweaks like combo boxes for user names.  In the end it involved importing bugs from disparate sources like a well-structure bug database, Microsoft Access fiels, and even Excel spreadsheets.  Bugzilla provides an XML import feature which is invaluable when migrating to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the features and the proven stability and security (the Mozilla one must be over 300,000 bugs by now), it is a great tool for developers.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Online Code Reviews - Codestriker</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/03/29/online-code-reviews-codestriker.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-03-29T19:33:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-03-29:blog/2007/03/29/online-code-reviews-codestriker.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Part of the development process at work is code reviews.  It is a peer review working as a sanity checker, and provides more than one set of eyes looking at the problem.  The process itself is fairly simply governed by an excellent source control system in &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; (with additional excellent tools like &lt;a href="http://www.tortoisesvn.net"&gt;TortoiseSVN&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an online tool to help with the annotations and code reviews process.  It's called &lt;a href="http://codestriker.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Codestriker&lt;/a&gt; and provides a web interface and access to the source control through it.  Basically the system provides the ability to annotate source code and allow others to read those notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's good for a formalised system, but is a very comprehensive system.  This means that it does take a lot more user interface interaction than a simple email detailing any changes.  For a large system with many developers it could be more of an invaluable tool, especially for large quantities of comments.  It is also useful if your code is really bad and you need lots of comments ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system also has Bugzilla integration, so stick together this, Subversion, and Bugzilla and you have quite a powerful open-source system.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Take Screenshots on Vista</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/03/09/take-screenshots-on-vista.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-03-09T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-03-09:blog/2007/03/09/take-screenshots-on-vista.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2007/01/28/window-clippings-1-5.aspx"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a great little program for taking screenshots on Vista without the pollution of underlying windows unless you want it to.

It is called "Why does Vista use all my memory" by Jeff Atwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially all system memory is now considered a cache (using a system called SuperFetch).  This means that the amount of memory used would be as much RAM as is available to cache from the hard-drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if I am completely sure it is a good idea because if a program requires a lot of memory then it has the initial lag to clear the cache in order to service memory requests.  Maybe as time goes on the technology will get better, so it may be more usable in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>OpenGL News and SDK Released</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/02/27/opengl-news-and-sdk-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-02-27T21:03:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-02-27:blog/2007/02/27/opengl-news-and-sdk-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Volume 3 of the &lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org"&gt;OpenGL&lt;/a&gt; has been released, &lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/vol003/"&gt;read it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't fancy messing round with the theming DLLs and using what essentially amount to substandard themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought how about getting the MCE2005 UI on Windows XP Pro (not a recreation of it but the actual one).  A few minutes Googling gave me my answer, Microsoft New Zealand had accidentally released the Royale theme, unfortunately they pulled it soon after.  Luckily this being the Internet the cat can never go back in the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-Enhancements/Themes/Royale-Theme-for-WinXP.shtml"&gt;MCE2005 Royale theme&lt;/a&gt; for Windows XP is available at the link.  You just need to run the installer and it puts it in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that like things a bit darker there is a Royale Noir theme leaked from Microsoft that did not make the cut into MCE2005.  You can download the files &lt;a href="http://plaza.ufl.edu/psrivats/Luna2.rar"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  You need to install this after the Royale theme.  Extract it to c:\WINDOWS\Resource\Luna Noir.  Then double-click on the luna.msstyles file, this will then give another sub-option to Royale on the Appearance tab in display settings.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>KDE News Roundup</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/02/26/kde-news-roundup.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-02-26T21:51:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-02-26:blog/2007/02/26/kde-news-roundup.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There has been even more KDE information flying about recently.

&lt;p&gt;No more Vista for me I am going back to Windows XP and hopefully a working life of sanity.  I had been at work for two hours and accomplished nothing but fighting with Windows Vista for uninstalling, installing, and rebooting.  Even then I didn't manage to finish what I was trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then I snapped.  I decided to go back to Windows XP.  No more deathly slow animations or silent marches of death through the UAC for me.  I have no idea if Vista is a good consumer OS, but it is awful for developers who have to constantly install, reboot, update, use large amounts of files, do incremental building, and other such things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't see a service pack rectifying the problem, maybe in three years it will be usable if the XP lifecycle is anything to go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was noticeable working on Vista then coming home to XP simply how much faster XP is.  It is not anything to do with slowness drawing to the screen or the length of animations.  It all comes down to things like context menus, and security running in the background that makes simple tasks like starting a program or switching applications into a waiting game.  Nothing ever "locks up" as something is always moving and interactive, but it rarely lets you do a series of quickfire operations or run multiple IDEs without groaning.  Don't even get me started on rebooting breaking C++ precompiled headers.&lt;/p&gt;

The ASL is written in C++ utilising sections of Boost (part of which now includes Adobe's on GIL library) and the most hardcore of generic programming techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing I came across was from Alexander Stepanov, the father of the STL, and writer of books about advanced template programming.  &lt;a href="http://www.stepanovpapers.com/notes.pdf"&gt;Alexander Stepanov's Notes&lt;/a&gt; is a substantial PDF file (more of a book really) that collates and updates his notes from various lectures including those at Adobe and SGI.  It is not entirely about C++ as such, it is just the example language used is C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also lead me to find the &lt;a href="http://www.stepanovpapers.com/"&gt;Stepanov Papers website&lt;/a&gt; which provides a resource for reading his wide selection of papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a bit more background on Generic programming check out these overviews &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/more/generic_programming.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - Win32++</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/02/10/gui-toolkits-win32.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-02-10T14:35:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-02-10:blog/2007/02/10/gui-toolkits-win32.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/programming/"&gt;Win32++&lt;/a&gt; is a GUI toolkit just for Windows.  It is a C++ toolkit providing abstraction from the base Win32 functionality, kind of like MFC, but written much better and more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a small toolkit that is a thin wrapper around the Win32 API.  It is not a drop-in replacement for anything else, but provides a simplified programming platform for beginners and intermediate programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides facilities for MDI, rebars, toolbars, critical sections and more.  I suppose it must be relatively easy to expand the number of classes if you have greater requirements.  The advantage of this toolkit is that unlike MFC it works with the free compilers as MFC is only supplied with the professional versions of Visual Studio.  Customisation of existing classes is suggested via subclassing, which is the simplest conceptual way of adding functionality in C++.  With these classes you will not run into the problems with virtual destructors and the cobject derived class issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of examples including a notepad program, some DirectX, some multithreading, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

NSIS2 is obviously the most popular and well known but when I was investigating both systems I found NSIS2 unwieldy and the scripting not very intuitive.  When I saw the Inno Setup scripting it just made sense, the language design is around installing programs and files.  It solves a very domain specific problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installers look great on whatever Windows version you run them on and there has been recent work on Vista compatibility.  The installers generated are really quite compact and in comparison to most MSI installers I have run it is substantially faster.  Also it is capable of 32 and 64 bit installers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes it even better is it comes with a great GUI frontend called ISTool.  It provides a GUI for all elements available and has excellent built-in help using tooltips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inno Setup comes with a comprehensive set of translations and also provides non-supported translations on the website.  So if your program is available internationally it is an easy feather in your cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inno Setup is the simplest to use and the fastest to get up and running.  You can knock up an installer in minutes without the need for consulting large manuals, I had my first test installer created from scratch in under ten minutes, so I imagine anyone can do it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Sabayon Linux</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/02/07/sabayon-linux.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-02-07T20:27:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-02-07:blog/2007/02/07/sabayon-linux.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A new distribution on the block is &lt;a href="http://www.sabayonlinux.org/"&gt;Sabayon Linux&lt;/a&gt;.  I don't normally make a habit of talking about Linux distributions, but I found it quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabayon is based on Gentoo, the infamous source-based Linux distribution.  What makes it interesting is it is a &lt;a href="http://dot.kde.org"&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; distribution with &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/02/beryl-020-preview.html"&gt;Beryl&lt;/a&gt; installed by default.  This gives lots of eye candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a live CD/DVD which means you can try it out with no risk, but also it provides the facilities to install to the hard drive.  This is much like most modern Linux distributions (like Ubuntu).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole design looks really quite good with transparent menu bars and a unified theme throughout.  You can see some screenshots &lt;a href="http://shots.osdir.com/slideshows/slideshow.php?release=758&amp;slide=16&amp;title=sabayonlinux+3.2+screenshots/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://shots.linuxquestions.org/?linux_distribution_sm=SabayonLinux%203.25"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I also noticed from the screenshots is that they are using &lt;a href="http://home.kde.org/~binner/kickoff/sneak_preview.html"&gt;Kickoff&lt;/a&gt; for the main program navigation.  I mentioned it previously &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/01/kde-happenings-and-version-4.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It fits in really nicely with all of the work that has obviously been lavished on the UI.  Unfortunately it looks like the default theme is trying to make the window borders look like Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally the point of this post is there is a nice review of this distribution by &lt;a href="http://www.linuxtechdaily.com/2007/02/review-sabayon-linux/"&gt;Linux Tech Daily here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Windows Vista - Menus</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/02/06/windows-vista-menus.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-02-06T22:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-02-06:blog/2007/02/06/windows-vista-menus.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Way back in November I made a post about &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/11/more-vista-menus.html"&gt;menus on Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt;.  Essentially it came down to the fact that custom drawing did not draw menu items correctly, and even Windows Explorer on Vista had the same rendering problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2007/02/06/Vista-Style-Menus_2C00_-Part-1-_2D00_-Adding-icons-to-standard-menus.aspx"&gt;post on Shell Blog about Vista style menus&lt;/a&gt; which starts a series about getting the menus to render correctly.  The first part provides a solution for those people that want icons next to the menu items where custom drawing previously provided the solution.  The most useful bit is there is a small bit of code to convert the HICON to a HBITMAP which is the main stumbling block for people trying to make the transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice the difference in style once the custom drawing is removed and it will look much more integrated.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Beryl 0.2.0 Preview</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/02/05/beryl-020-preview.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-02-05T20:48:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-02-05:blog/2007/02/05/beryl-020-preview.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a nice long preview of &lt;a href="http://www.beryl-project.org/"&gt;Beryl&lt;/a&gt; 0.2.0 you can &lt;a href="http://lunapark6.com/?p=2916"&gt;read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I realise it is a very pessimistic view and I know it won't happen, because it will probably just cause more hardware churn (the buying of new hardware).  Those that know what they are doing with computers though will still plough their own furrow with well designed solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem I am getting to though is Visual Studio 2005.  Initially we were really impressed with it, you can look inside of arrays and it allowed settings to be exported and automated.  Unfortunately months down the line I think it must suffer from digital entropy.  The .vssettings files seem to rarely work now even though there is nothing to suggest why the settings will not take.  The bscmake.exe continually fails, sometimes with an out of memory exception.  The incremental linking can sometimes  take over 20 minutes for a simple one file change.  The STL is simply too slow if you rely on the speed of the STL operation.  The Intellisense update can cause the UI to freeze up and it rarely builds the symbols correctly meaning you can be left with no tooltips.  VS2005 uses masses more memory and gradually slows down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing was when we installed it, there was definitely a lot of bonuses, but after having to use it for a few months it becomes incredibly difficult to defend it.  I think the IDE is now geared towards CLI/.NET development so it probably works seamlessly for that, but for C++ only it seems to be lacking and going backwards in some instances by forcing some "secure" programming on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it is still the best IDE for developing on Windows and there is very little to touch it.  Maybe in the future something like &lt;a href="http://www.codeblocks.org"&gt;Code::Blocks&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; could catch it, but it will probably always be ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - CEGUI</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/01/30/gui-toolkits-cegui.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-01-30T22:43:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-01-30:blog/2007/01/30/gui-toolkits-cegui.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cegui.org.uk"&gt;CEGUI or Crazy Eddie's GUI System&lt;/a&gt; is not a typical GUI toolkit.  It is designed primarily for gamers to embed a GUI interface into graphics windows (normally in order to use this they would be fullscreen or you would use the platform toolkit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GUI toolkit itself has backends for DirectX 8.1 &amp;amp; 9, &lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org"&gt;OpenGL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/"&gt;OGRE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Irrlicht&lt;/a&gt;.  This allows you to then overlay GUI elements into your program window.  The advantage of being self-rendering is that it is then cross platform.  Currently it supports Linux and Windows and Mac OSX support is on its way.  The nature of the renderer backend means it would be trivial to use it in something like &lt;a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org"&gt;OpenSceneGraph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the theming ability of the engine it is possible to use this toolkit as your start screen menus for games or even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toolkit itself is written in object-oriented C++ and looks really quite clean from the examples.  For its niche it really doesn't have masses of competition, but it does not preclude it from being and impressive solution.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Vista Is A Coming</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/01/29/vista-is-coming.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-01-29T20:35:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-01-29:blog/2007/01/29/vista-is-coming.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Vista is released to consumers tomorrow...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using Vista for two months now and it has been nothing but a pain.  It has actually slowed my rate of work by virtue of being slow, unresponsive, and needlessly verbose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I ran a &lt;a href="http://www.cygwin.com"&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt; script which created some text files.  Now I can't get the permissions on the directories will not allow me to remove them, it sends me through numerous UAC dialogs asking for permission and then it throws up an error message with a cryptic hex value.  Even editing file and directory permissions fails to alleviate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just a new problem encountered day to day, it is a problem that slows you down.  Installing and executing software is massively slower, I guess due to some security changes.  It is all the small things that add up to a big annoyance as there is not one thing that is excessively bad (although UAC is close to that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best problem I have on Windows Vista is that I can't reboot because it breaks my C++ compilation in Visual Studio 2005.  Sounds mad, but it is completely true, the precompiled header or something causes an internal compiler error when trying an incremental build even just changing a single .CPP file.  Unfortunately I can find no relevant documentation on this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Comparison of environments</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/01/28/comparison-of-environments.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-01-28T20:22:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-01-28:blog/2007/01/28/comparison-of-environments.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/hotw/comparison/comparison.html"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting look at how the development environments differ by platform.

It runs at a lovely 1920x1200 resolution - that is a lot of desktop real estate.  The reason I wanted a larger monitor more than a new computer was that I was struggling to use the smaller monitor for all my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sacrilege I am bestowing upon this beautiful piece of hardware is that I have to work on Windows (and more specifically the beast that is Vista).  What this showed me is Windows is rubbish for working on large monitors in any meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems?  Simply most software designed for Windows is designed to work in full screen mode (and much of the development tools encourage this).  In most instances this is complete rubbish when you are working on a large monitor.  Even the two monitor configuration encourages you to still work with each screen using full screen apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem is that the window handling and the taskbar itself just isn't up to the job of context switching.  This is partially because MDI interfaces (either traditional or tabbed) are controlled by the application not the OS.  The actual windows are also not broken down into functional elements.  Even editing in Word encourages you to use fullscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the demo I had of Mac OSX it deals with multiple windows much better, also all the time I used Linux (KDE and Gnome) it felt like it was geared for large screen use.  It is partially the reason that &lt;a href="http://www.gimp.org"&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt; works much better on Linux than it does in Windows and people using Windows have immese problems with the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If large screen computers somehow become the norm I think that Windows will need to come up with a more intelligent way for the user to use the space.  At the moment the resolutions we have are great, but having a more sharply rendered image is of less benefit than using the extra space more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>CAM stuff</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/01/25/cam-stuff.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-01-25T20:14:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-01-25:blog/2007/01/25/cam-stuff.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My day job is spent writing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing"&gt;CAM software&lt;/a&gt;.

I thought I'd put all of the recent good links into one handy place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE in Suse Linux 10.2 is reviewed &lt;a href="http://blogbeebe.blogspot.com/2006/12/suse-102-part-3-looking-at-kde.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It has some really impressive screenshots of version 3.5 which doesn't even have the splendid new features.  It features the new start menu type thing called &lt;a href="http://home.kde.org/~binner/kickoff/sneak_preview.html"&gt;Kickoff&lt;/a&gt;, check out the link to see it animated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bizarrely what kicked off this wealth of information about the progress of KDE4 was someone making a blog post saying there was no progress and no future progress in desktop Linux.  It was completely misguided, but it started an avalanche waking up a dozing beast, one of the KDE developers made this &lt;a href="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2006/12/website-does-not-make-you-smart.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list of features targeted at KDE4 can be viewed &lt;a href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2007/01/sneek-preview-of-expected-features-in.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an article about the SVG rendering in applications &lt;a href="http://dot.kde.org/1167723426/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view an article about the KOffice 2.0 technologies &lt;a href="http://dot.kde.org/1168284615/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now a proper installer for running KDE on Windows seamlessly.  This is detailed in &lt;a href="http://commit-digest.org/issues/2007-01-14/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.  Also there is now KDE for Mac (so it integrates properly into OSX and not like those X11 applications).  There is some coverage of this &lt;a href="http://dot.kde.org/1168899755/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Both of these are possible thanks to Qt being GPL on both platforms now at version 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally there is an article about the new &lt;a href="http://dot.kde.org/1169588301/"&gt;job progress user interface&lt;/a&gt;.  It looks like it could be quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code used in my observations is a C++ MFC based application.  The STL used are mainly containers with virtually zero iostreams code (or at least so little it will not change the results).  The container usage are from very large long-lived containers through to many short lived small containers and everything inbetween.  Massive amounts of containers are created throughout the program lifetime.  Luckily most containers are created in thread local storage and gets freed when the thread has done its work.  The thread allocators use the allocator provided in STLPort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in performance is marked for what is essentially lots of insertions into STL containers and lots of reads from them.  When we are talking about a 20% performance gain by using STLPort it is quite scary, but also means switching to Microsoft STL would be unacceptable to users because the slowdown would be so noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>OpenGL In Python</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/01/23/opengl-in-python.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-01-23T20:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-01-23:blog/2007/01/23/opengl-in-python.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/"&gt;pyOpenGL&lt;/a&gt; provides access to OpenGL in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the guys at work has just bought one, and now I want one...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is astonishing simply how good OSX is.  During the demo I saw how much it works like the way I want to use a computer.  When people who have used it say how good it is they are not exaggerating and don't have an axe to grind, they just have a computer that makes their life easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I noticed most about it is that MDI is alive and well.  It's not like the Windows MDI where the application encapsulates the sub projects, the operating system in OSX does the heavy lifting.  With this it also makes it much more structured and intuitive.  I can imagine working with loads of Photoshop documents and text documents at once and it all being being intuitive.  It is possible to see all the documents open at once with a zooming out style view, and it is also possible to see all the documents for a particular application.  It may not look as 3D &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs start very quickly and stay memory resident for fast access if necessary.  It is always clear what is going on and the user interface does is always responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this and I haven't mentioned how good it looks.  It has lots of great touches in the UI but none of them take over or clutter the display.  Screenshots dn't do it justice - you simply have to see it in the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One great bit of software for OSX is &lt;a href="http://www.neooffice.org/"&gt;NeoOffice&lt;/a&gt; which is OpenOffice in Mac clothing.  It integrates really well into the way OSX works.  All developers involved deserve kudos for making OpenOffice into NeoOffice which I think is actually an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bit I wanted to see was X-Code for OSX development since I had heard so much about it.  Unfortunately it is not installed by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially it will give a perceived boost in performance to the user by predicting which applications may be run next and prepares for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know really whether this is such a great idea - surely it would be better to help developers make applications that load faster rather than trying to paper the cracks?  And surely this will effect processor performance further?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application I work on loads in less than a second and is usable and can load substantial files of half a gig of compressed data and be ready to work with in under a minute.  Also, because of the multithreading the program is still usable whilst the loading process is going on.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/01/21/visual-studio-2005-service-pack-1.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-01-21T22:09:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-01-21:blog/2007/01/21/visual-studio-2005-service-pack-1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released the first service pack for Visual Studio .NET 2005 a short while back.

It's great to this see this finally happen as it has been so close for so long (in fat it was pretty usable not long into its development).  One of my favourite technologies it has is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(computer_graphics)"&gt;Portal Rendering&lt;/a&gt;, this was added because the original version of &lt;a href="http://www.3drealms.com/"&gt;Prey&lt;/a&gt; (before it got canned and eventually released recently).  At the time it was going to be revolutionary, but I think that style of rendering can produce some cool and crazy effects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - wxWidgets - The Future?</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/01/19/gui-toolkits-wxwidgets-future.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-01-19T19:43:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-01-19:blog/2007/01/19/gui-toolkits-wxwidgets-future.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org"&gt;wxWidgets&lt;/a&gt; has been going now for getting on to 15 years.  Some of the people developing it and some people using or evaluating it have said that it is old fashioned in design.  This is part of the legacy from being based on a similar design to MFC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently wxWidgets makes heavy use of macros in C++, and it also makes a tiny use of STL (after all when development started the STL was not even formalised).  I don't think the code is particularly unintuitive or difficult to use, but so much of the API has been set in stone.  One particular area of discussion is the event handling because of the advent of signals and slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a page on the wiki for &lt;a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/wiki/index.php/Development:_wxWidgets_3"&gt;wxWidgets: The Next Generation&lt;/a&gt;.  It is not really actively edited.  I don't know whether it will ever get out of the planning stages, I think this is probably due to the fact that the current version is simply good enough to use.  There are other priorities that want/need to be developed, and redesigning the API is not really hugely useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other GUI toolkits use some of the more powerful C++ features, but most only use small areas of it.  I think the main advantage of developing a clean API is that it is possible to make many different language bindings.  In fact I think that is what should be aimed at for most modern libraries being developed, because if you can do it in a suitably abstract fashion you'll end up with something easily maintainable and as close to future-proof as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Game Programming - Management Games</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/01/18/game-programming-management-games.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-01-18T20:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-01-18:blog/2007/01/18/game-programming-management-games.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my guilty pleasures is &lt;a href="http://www.sigames.com"&gt;Football Manager (and previously Championship Manager)&lt;/a&gt;, it is definitely my favourite type of game - open-ended, considered, and graphics are not the most important part - it is gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We upgraded to Visual Studio .NET 2005 from Visual Studio .NET 2003 with &lt;a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net/"&gt;STLPort&lt;/a&gt; 4.6.  We decided to make the switch to Microsoft STL which in coding terms was very simple.  This slowed the entire system down massively, especially in debug mode.  I covered in &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/visual-studio-2005-lets-break.html"&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt; how to gain back some of the performance.  This speeds up the STL by a massive amount as the safe iterator and iterator checking have large overheads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison to STLport the performance in debug is so much slower that it is completely unusable for anything beyond the most simple operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In release mode the performance is not quite as bad.  For one of our large tests it takes approximately 30000 seconds with our old build system.  With the Microsoft STL with all the possible performance improvements possible the tests took over 36000 seconds to run.  The performance degradation was unacceptable.  It was not only the time but memory as well, with the large data sets we use this causes massive amounts of paging to hard drive.  The Microsoft STL uses about 50% more memory than STLport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately STLport is not as easy to debug as the Microsoft implementation is coupled with the debugger.  But the performance degradation is simply too much to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current version of &lt;a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net/"&gt;STLport is 5.1&lt;/a&gt; and works with loads of compilers and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Vista Craplets</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/01/11/vista-craplets.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-01-11T23:40:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-01-11:blog/2007/01/11/vista-craplets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nope, this isn't a post moaning about Vista...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior Microsoft Corp executive is worried items he terms as "craplets" could damage the perception of Microsoft Vista.  These things he is referring to are the "added value" programs that OEMs add to their specific version of the operating system above and beyond what Microsoft supply.  These are the programs like DVD writers and other icons cluttering your new computer's desktop that are unnecessary and usually completely rubbish and destructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the article &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/10/tech-microsoft.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's good to see someone might improve the situation as I spent some of yesterday on a new computer just do uninstalls of tens of programs on a brand new Dell.  These programs were not needed and basically served as adverts.  Also you have to remove the links to various ISPs and the suchlike that you would never switch to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think this will fix the situation though and perhaps just make the problems more uniform, or they are the same problems with a stamp of approval from Microsoft.  If possible you should always try to get hold of a Windows disc that is Microsoft vanilla and use that for reinstalls.  But beware - you must get the right one for your registration key as there are two types of disc - the OEM and the commercial - and the keys are not interchangeable.  I found this out when finishing a reinstall it would not accept a key as it was an OEM key and it wanted a shop bought one.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Windows MCE - The Codec Issue</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/01/11/windows-mce-codec-issue.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-01-11T21:14:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-01-11:blog/2007/01/11/windows-mce-codec-issue.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I installed Windows MCE Edition I updated everything to what Windows Update offered.

&lt;p&gt;My media centre is based on a cheap AOpen XC-Cube with a cheapo Sempron 2600+.  Amazingly it works pretty well the only problem being the transition animations are not too smooth occasionally when running at the highest possible resolution (1280x1024x32bpp).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been quite impressed with the software.  It is much smoother to set up then the open-source ones I have used in the past, but I don't particularly want to use something because it is the path of least resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general the smooth set up and the smooth operation has been better than I expected.  It now works much better with the MCE infra-red keyboard and control, the stand-by operation is much smoother and wake-up ability much better.  Maybe the drivers installed for MCE since it does not necessarily use the same drivers as XP Home/Pro make it more stable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still after installing it you have to download one round of updates, then 78 updates, then another 13 (at least).  That takes ages - yawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm actually quite impressed by the associated operating system - it is XP with a lick of paint and extra features.  I have no idea why Microsoft didn't use it as an opportunity to release a new version of the OS at the consumer level since MCE is only really for manufacturers.  All manufacturers seem to be using MCE ahead of XP Home anyway now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it has been a very good experience and my wife is finding it easy to use, that is always a good yardstick.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Apple iPhone</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/01/09/apple-iphone.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-01-09T21:04:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2007-01-09:blog/2007/01/09/apple-iphone.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone"&gt;Apple iPhone&lt;/a&gt; website has gone live.

There had been recent rumblings that Apple were going to have an embedded version of OS X and this is it.  It looks fantastic, I just hope it runs as well as it looks.  Being OS X you get Safari as your web browser, you can use desktop widgets, and it all looks great.  Hopefully this also means that developers can really go to town, with the benefit of Apple's APIs and also being able to do cross-platform development.  Hell, this version of OS X even still supports multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;

One thing that most people haven't realise is that they have been using multiple CPUs for years, one has been your CPU and the other is the GPU - your graphics card.  The graphics card is a very specialised computational unit, but it was added in order to offload processing from your main processor to something else to allow the processor to not get bogged down with graphics processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with the advent of dual core machines and the upcoming (or released in small quantities) quad core machines, a lot of users will probably not know they are using only a fraction of their processing power most of the time.  Maybe it is time for the GPU to become one of those cores on the CPU?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment the most likely use for multiple CPUs on Windows is one core to run your antivirus and your antispyware software and the rest you can use normally...  At least that is what an article I read said multiple cores would be used for when they come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the programmable GPUs start to become more common in the next generation of graphics cards they are becoming more and more like a general CPU, so it must be possible for the CPU with multiple cores to have a core or two behave more like a GPU?  Certainly when the 8 core processors come out it would probably be quite nice to use multiple cores as the "graphics card".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine though that there are people in labs much smarter than me already working on something like that or better.  It's nearly 2007 after all and we are living in the future (well at least it sounds like the future to me) but we still have all of these different things cobbled together making up the current PCs.  It would be sort of nice to see lots of processing converge onto the single multiple core chip as now they are more than capable of doing the tasks whereas ten years ago we still had a processor that was only capable of multitasking in a single core.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>CAD File Formats</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/12/20/cad-file-formats.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-12-20T22:33:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-12-20:blog/2006/12/20/cad-file-formats.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest headaches in CAD/CAM is file formats.  In fact it is a complete nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every product out there tends to have its own proprietary format and they normally contain deliberate gotchas and obfuscation to try and prevent reverse engineering the formats.  Also if they provide a DLL to read the format they will deliberate hobble it as well as making sure you have signed some sort of EULA agreement.  That is if you can get to an agreement as if they know you have signed up with another competitor to read their format they might not be so forthcoming with their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all it is the dinosaur's way of doing things, especially in the day and age of open formats for things like Office Suites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are open formats, and most CAD packages allow you to export your data in one of these defined formats.  But they rarely follow the formats correctly and throw away lots of information that would otherwise be useful, so you really want to use the original data.  The most annoying part is having to extrapolate the intentional and unintentional errors that deviate from the specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally you will have to either reverse engineer the format yourself, manage to get a deal with the vendor of the product you want to be compatible with, or find someone who supplies the reverse engineering service as a library you can integrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be so nice if there was a format that could be used for interoperability, but I think most companies like tying people down to their programs and it would require a sea change like what happened with OpenOffice and the Open Document Format (ODF).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Development - Testing</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/12/19/development-testing.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-12-19T14:31:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-12-19:blog/2006/12/19/development-testing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Testing is probably the first thing to go in commercial development as a preventative measure since it adds to development time and also adds to the cost of development.

It is based solely around plug-ins and provides a good development environment.  At the moment most of its strength is the Java development and its use for embedded systems (see my previous article about SunSPOTs - that used the Eclipse IDE for remote debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the projects within it I keep an eye on is the &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/"&gt;CDT&lt;/a&gt; project which is a plug-in for C/C++ aiming to be as strong as the Java development.  At the moment it is used a lot for the embedded space, but they want to extend it even further and challenge the &lt;br /&gt;Visual Studio IDEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy heading up the CDT project Doug Schaefer has been blogging about the progress of the project for a while.  In the CDT 4.0 roadmap the plan is to use the Windows SDK and have integrated debugging and the suchlike.  His most recent post &lt;a href="http://cdtdoug.blogspot.com/2006/12/migrating-from-visualc-to-cdt.html"&gt;"Migrating From Visual C++ to CDT"&lt;/a&gt; shows the progress the project is making.  It is always great to have alternatives and Eclipse certainly could help along that route.  Part of the plan is also to add C# support as well from the Windows SDK.  At the moment I would not recommend using CDT in lieu of VS2005 for Windows application development but if your toolchain is make based you may find this a better alternative.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Cambridge SPA Meeting - Seeing SunSPOTs</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/12/15/cambridge-spa-meeting-seeing-sunspots.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-12-15T12:43:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-12-15:blog/2006/12/15/cambridge-spa-meeting-seeing-sunspots.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the 13th December I attended the &lt;a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge"&gt;Cambridge SPA&lt;/a&gt; meeting.  Cambridge SPA is an offshoot (or part of) of the &lt;a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge"&gt;BCS&lt;/a&gt; and they hold monthly meetings for varied presentations about lots of aspects of computing.  I decided to throw caution to the wind and see what it was like (after all it was free) and it was hosted at &lt;a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge"&gt;Microsoft Research Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; who generously provided the rooms and laid on a buffet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation was about &lt;a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/"&gt;SunSPOTs&lt;/a&gt; which are small programmable Java devices.  It is defined as Java On The Metal since there is no operating system and Java does all of the control.  When you tell Java to sleep() the device also sleeps and it is extremely power efficient.  It uses the &lt;a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/squawk/squawk-rjvm.html"&gt;Squawk Java VM&lt;/a&gt; which provides a version of Java ME functionality.  The device also has sensors built in like tilt and light sensors.  It communicates wirelessly or by USB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the impression that it still hasn't found its true purpose yet, but is proving that Java is a good solution for the embedded environment space.  It also provides much better debugging facilities than traditional embedded environments.  Still, all very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was most interesting that my old haunt &lt;a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk"&gt;Essex University&lt;/a&gt; is using these devices.  And it was one of my favourite masters courses that was using it &lt;a href="http://iieg.essex.ac.uk/"&gt;The Intelligent Buildings Group&lt;/a&gt;.  It was bizarre to hear this since when I read about the presentation initially I thought this would have been ideal for Intelligent Buildings studies at Essex Uni.  When I did my dissertation there I was looking at the TINI Java embedded board for that although it didn't amount to a great deal in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I had a good time, met some people, got informed about an interesting subject, so all in all it was a good use of an evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone lives near Cambridge and is interested in computing in general, I can recommend you check it out.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - wxWidgets 2.8 Released</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/12/14/gui-toolkits-wxwidgets-28-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-12-14T21:53:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-12-14:blog/2006/12/14/gui-toolkits-wxwidgets-28-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The latest stable release of &lt;a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/"&gt;wxWidgets&lt;/a&gt; has been released.

This is a platform for developing  managed DirectX applications targeted at PCs and X-Box 360s.  The development environment is based on the Visual C# Express edition that Microsoft released earlier this year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to develop for the X-Box 360 you have to join the &lt;a href="http://msdn.com/xna/creator"&gt;Creators's Club&lt;/a&gt; at $100 per year.  You are not allowed to use it for commercial development on the X-Box 360, but you can for targeting Windows.  For commercial development on X-Box 360 there will be an XNA Professional version released some point next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Windows Vista and Server 2003 are unsupported, but then again Visual Studio 2005 is unsupported on Vista so it is no surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

The problem with triangle meshes is that they don't really want to have decent normals defined for them, especially if your triangles have inflections between them from the generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who is much better than me at geometry pointed me at a really good article about normals and curvature from arbitrary meshes.  The article is &lt;a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/gfx/pubs/_2004_ECA/index.php"&gt;Estimating Curvatures and Their Derivatives on Triangle Meshes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are implementations of the ideas in the article in &lt;a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/gfx/proj/trimesh2/"&gt;trimesh2&lt;/a&gt;.  It's worthwhile taking a look at the source code (it's in C/C++) and is fairly self-explanatory if not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculating the normal on an arbitrary mesh is fairly simple if you don't want to be accurate in the slightest.  Just take the average of the triangles that share the point.  This works fairly well if your triangles do not have inflections and they are divided into separate surfaces (or faces depending on your terminology).  The idea behind this paper is to look at regions of points and to get the average of these, but weight them for their distance from the point you are attempting to calculate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you store this data it is only a one time calculation hit, so it will not slow down your program.  This type of calculation is perfect for 3D rendering, although I need to see the overall quality in order to determine if it can be used for applications requiring more accurate results like CAD/CAM.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Java - Java SE 6 and NetBeans</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/12/11/java-java-se-6-and-netbeans.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-12-11T21:57:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-12-11:blog/2006/12/11/java-java-se-6-and-netbeans.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sun have &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/"&gt;released Java SE 6&lt;/a&gt; the latest version of Java for use in developing desktop and server applications.

For anyone who likes obscure bits of code it is really quite interesting and I think really understanding the code does make you a better programmer even if you never use it.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;float InvSqrt (float x) {&lt;br /&gt;float xhalf = 0.5f&lt;em&gt;x;&lt;br /&gt;int i = &lt;/em&gt;(int&lt;em&gt;)&amp;x;&lt;br /&gt;i = 0x5f3759df - (i&amp;gt;&amp;gt;1);&lt;br /&gt;x = &lt;/em&gt;(float&lt;em&gt;)&amp;i;&lt;br /&gt;x = x&lt;/em&gt;(1.5f - xhalf&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;x);&lt;br /&gt;return x;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/blockquote&gt;It computes the result using integer maths instead of floating point operations because back in the day that was faster.  This function does the operation to an approximation which is fine when it is used in graphics where the human eye finds it impossible to differentiate small changes in colour.  It is one of those functions where the more you iterate the more accurate the result it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works by reinterpreting the float bit pattern as an integer then using bit shifting to get at the mantissa.  The "magic seed value" is an approximation of the result (it is easier to get a good approximation when the result is in a mostly predictable range).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway a useful tome about this kind of trickery is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAKMEM"&gt;HACKMEM&lt;/a&gt;, you can read it online &lt;a href="http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/hakmem/hakmem.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've already said that MFC isn't as bad as most diatribes make it sound.  The macros although seen as antiquated do actually make the code pretty easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a lot of large and mature applications use MFC as the basis of their user interface, and normally due to the time and number of developers on the application the blurring between UI and the rest of the code might be a bit fuzzy.  Some products would have had a clear design from the start to abstract the UI behind a company designed layer of abstraction, but the scary thing is most of these MFC based applications probably started using the built-in app wizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft trying to force everyone into .NET framework applications they start to avoid putting functionality in MFC and only allowing it through .NET.  Fortunately it is still built on the Win32 API and means writing in standard C++ all the new features will be available so long as you roll your sleeves up and dig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Vista will probably be the dominant Windows platform for the forseeable future if you can make your MFC application look good on that platform and look well integrated then you are good to go for another five years at least.  It would certainly be worthwhile if you would never be allowed to port your app to another language or another GUI toolkit, be it from time or cost constraints or external pressures.  The benefits would be not developing your own solution and also not having the headache of maintenance, which would be critical if the size of your team does not allow for UI type fun.  It's certainly the path of least resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind I decided to investigate MFC extension libraries.  There are four I found that are commercially supported.  Most of these offerings are simply a case of changing what classes you inherit from.  These libraries typically come with source code when you buy a licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codejock.com/"&gt;CodeJock XTreme ToolkitPro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best out of all the ones I have had a look at.  Simply it works the smoothest, it looks the nicest and most integrated, and it provides a rich wealth of components.  Recent versions have added the Office 2007 style ribbon-bar.  The upcoming version 10.4 fixes some outstanding issues with DWM on Vista although they certainly aren't critical.  The demo version was certainly a breeze to get up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.prof-uis.com/"&gt;Prof-UIS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks second best.  It certainly renders as nice as the CodeJock offering and possibly is not so skinned so it can look more integrated, but when resizing the rendering can take a while to catch up and leaves black areas (this is on Vista).  Overall the rendering speed does not seem fast enough.  Still, it is a stylish toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bcgsoft.com/"&gt;BCGControlBarPro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this offering is on par with Prof-UIS, it runs okay and looks good.  This one didn't look quite right on Vista but runs fine on XP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theultimatetoolbox.com/"&gt;ULTIMATE toolbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn't quite as up to date with the latest features like the previous three but it seems to be well respected and seems to be the most mature.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - MFC to Qt Migration</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/12/06/gui-toolkits-mfc-to-qt-migration.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-12-06T21:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-12-06:blog/2006/12/06/gui-toolkits-mfc-to-qt-migration.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I haven't got round to actively trying out Qt yet, although I have heard more or less universally good stuff about it (if you discount the meta-object compiler which is simply a matter of taste, oh yeah, and the price, but we all want something for nothing...).  One day I will find the time to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qt is the premier cross-platform GUI toolkit.  It has its foibles, but I'll leave that for when I review it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the areas on their website details the migration to Qt from MFC.  They actually provide lots of information about how to go about this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main link is here - &lt;a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/addon/solutions/catalog/4/Windows/qtwinmigrate/"&gt;The Qt/MFC Migration Framework&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/solutions/4/qtwinmigrate/winmigrate-walkthrough.html"&gt;Walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; is the most practical application of the knowledge.  The &lt;a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/learnmore/migration/mfc"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt; also provides interesting tidbits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, there is no way to tell how successful this is without speaking to someone who has ported a moderately large and mature app from MFC to Qt, but it is interesting to see someone does provide some kind of migration path (if that is the way you want to go).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>OpenGL - The OpenGL Window Framework</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/12/06/opengl-opengl-window-framework.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-12-06T20:48:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-12-06:blog/2006/12/06/opengl-opengl-window-framework.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;During numerous hours of websurfing I stumbled across the &lt;a href="http://oglwfw.sourceforge.net"&gt;OpenGL Window Framework&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a thin layer on top of OpenGL to make extra nice for C++ developers.  Unfortunately it does not seem to be actively developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it provides is a nice C++ interface for OpenGL with respect for making window contexts.  It gives you access to extensions via the &lt;a href="http://elf-stone.com/glee.php"&gt;Glee&lt;/a&gt; library.  It gives you an enumeration framework for modes and features, and also there are design considerations for multi-threaded programming which is important in this day and age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a very tightly focussed library designed for making using OpenGL and creating the windows for it much easier, and it seems to do that pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>OpenGL - Extensions for all the latest features</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/12/06/opengl-extensions-for-all-latest.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-12-06T20:32:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-12-06:blog/2006/12/06/opengl-extensions-for-all-latest.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When a new graphics card (generation) is released they normally have lots of new shiny features.  These are added to the OpenGL drivers by the extension mechanism until they are either forgotten about or become part of the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily there are two projects out there to try and make it easier, the &lt;a href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/"&gt;OpenGL Extension Wrangler (Glew)&lt;/a&gt; and also the &lt;a href="http://elf-stone.com/glee.php"&gt;GL Easy Extension Library (Glee)&lt;/a&gt;.  These both provide the ability to enumerate and then use the extensions provided.  They are also cross-platform which is always a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not the easiest way to maintain code as it requires specialist code depending on the graphics card's capabilities, but if you want to be on the bleeding edge they will allow you to code there.  You will also have to be aware that the function names could change if they become part of the main OpenGL library.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>OpenGL Libraries - OpenSceneGraph</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/12/06/opengl-libraries-openscenegraph.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-12-06T19:27:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-12-06:blog/2006/12/06/opengl-libraries-openscenegraph.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since I spend a fair amount of time working with OpenGL I always take an interest in libraries that use it.  In fact a lot of game development libraries should really have applications outside of that domain, it is just that "professionals" see themselves as above using crude game development libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the larger projects I have found really interesting is &lt;a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/"&gt;OpenSceneGraph&lt;/a&gt;.  It is based on the idea of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph"&gt;scene graphs&lt;/a&gt; which provides an object-oriented storage of the scene to aid rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This library is quite a high level of abstraction away from the underlying rendering (although it will allow you access to it).  It provides cross platform support as well as 64 bit platforms.  It probably is seen not to have the shiny whizz-bang features that are more associated with the game dedicated libraries.  Nevertheless it scales really well and can produce some &lt;a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/osgwiki/pmwiki.php/Screenshots/Screenshots"&gt;stunning results&lt;/a&gt;.  Most of the applications are more VR related but I am sure over time it will have more diverse applications.  I always winder how something like scene graphs would work in the land of CAD, although they are not really designed for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it is OpenGL based it is really quite easy to create a view in your GUI toolkit using OpenSceneGraph, as normally they are constructed via the window handles.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Computer Societies - Cambridge</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/12/04/computer-societies-cambridge.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-12-04T22:28:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-12-04:blog/2006/12/04/computer-societies-cambridge.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got to thinking this week, surely there are some computer groups or societies in my area (hopefully filled with people I could learn from).

It aims to build a community in Cambridge based computing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a &lt;a href="http://www.cambridge-lug.org/"&gt;Cambridge Linux Users Group&lt;/a&gt;.  Could be interesting for a Linux look at things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A user interface focussed group called &lt;a href="http://ukupa.org.uk/"&gt;Usability Professionals' Association UK Chapter&lt;/a&gt;.  There is an area group - &lt;a href="http://www.ukupa.org.uk/cambridge/"&gt;The Cambridge Usability Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is the &lt;a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/"&gt;Code Generation Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge this year.  Also there is an &lt;a href="http://www.international-lisp-conference.org/2007/index"&gt;International Lisp Conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cambridge3g.com/"&gt;Cambridge Wireless&lt;/a&gt; is a group focussed obviously on wireless stuff with plenty of events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A more business focussed group - &lt;a href="http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/"&gt;The Cambridge Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The problem with loads of the conferences is that they are normally very expensive (fine if your work is interested in sending you).  But the SPA Cambridge meetings are free, so I will definitely have to go as there is no excuse (and it looks like I missed some interesting ones in the past year).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Architectures</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/12/03/gui-architectures.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-12-03T20:55:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-12-03:blog/2006/12/03/gui-architectures.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html"&gt;article here&lt;/a&gt; about the design architecture for GUIs.

The system is called Mondrian and there is some more information &lt;a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/11/google-mondrian.html"&gt;here on a blog interview&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Currently we use DrawItem() and MeasureItem() to custom draw the menu items so that they have icons next to the items.  Unfortunately on Vista the custom drawing of the base implementation of DrawItem() simply does not look right under Vista.  It utilises the solid dark blue bar when you hover the mouse and the spacings look odd, and this is the default implementation.  Also, the background colour is a little darker and the disabled text does not look very good.  Without the custom draw functions it integrates much better in Vista, but I need to finish implementing some code for the associated icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I was using Windows Explorer under Vista and realised the context menus have EXACTLY the same problem.  This is just completely insane, they obviously implemented the functionality in exactly the same way, but the underlying Windows API could not have been updated for this.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Windows Vista - The Start Menu</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/27/windows-vista-start-menu.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-27T20:36:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-27:blog/2006/11/27/windows-vista-start-menu.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I mentioned the &lt;a &lt;br /&gt;href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/11/windows-vista-new-start-menu.html"&amp;gt;Windows Start Menu mess&lt;/a&gt;.

It seems that the drivers were throwing floating point exceptions in random places, I tidied up the code as much as possible but it still happened.  The only way to get around this problem was to not unmask the floating point exceptions in the thread performing the OpenGL rendering (although most applications seem not to unmask floating point exceptions as I have discovered).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine when the drivers are as mature as the XP drivers these will be but a distant memory, as in the olden days the way the OpenGL drivers handled exceptions was pretty random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I want to reiterate is that OpenGL works seamlessly on Vista with the dwm Aero experience.  People still think they have to migrate away from OpenGL to DirectX/Direct3D, I cannot emphasise enough this is not the case.  I know some companies still haven't managed to filter through that information, but it is the case and the computer I am using is evidence of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So spread the word OpenGL is fully compatible and runs natively with Windows Vista!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>OpenGL - The Future Looks Rosey</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/23/opengl-future-looks-rosey.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-23T21:38:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-23:blog/2006/11/23/opengl-future-looks-rosey.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the recent past the perceived as slow-moving OpenGL ARB (Architecture Review Board) handed over the guidance of OpenGL to the &lt;a href="http://www.khronos.org/"&gt;Kronos Group&lt;/a&gt;.  The Kronos Group were responsible for the very popular OpenGL ES standard for embedded devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that had completely bypassed me on the &lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org/"&gt;OpenGL website&lt;/a&gt; was a new &lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/"&gt;Pipeline Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for the latest goings on in OpenGL land.  There are currently two volumes:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/vol001"&gt;Volume 001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/vol002"&gt;Volume 002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In the first volume we are introduced to the OpenGL Ecosystem Working Group which was formed in March 2006.  This group is going to do all the work as developers we will probably find most useful - examples, documentation, testing, etc.  Most interesting though is the thought of the OpenGL SDK which I will come back to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the second newsletter there will be two OpenGL specification releases in 2007, with a substantial restructuring of the object model.  Also there is some information about the work for OpenGL on other platforms.  Just the communication from these newsletters makes OpenGL seem much faster moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to the OpenGL SDK.  As the Ecosystem Working Group put it, developers want a single SDK for OpenGL that is ratified by the ARB.  This would also contain the documentation and examples and more.  In the newsletter article &lt;a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/article/vol002_2/"&gt;"One SDK To Rule Them All"&lt;/a&gt; more detail is revealed.  If all goes to plan then this should be a very impressive start.  One part of particular interest is the suggestion there will be more to the SDK, with layers that abstract away platform specifics.  THis can only be a good thing - no need to reinvent the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>OpenGL and Vista</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/23/opengl-and-vista.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-23T21:36:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-23:blog/2006/11/23/opengl-and-vista.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, that was easy.

&lt;p&gt;The details are available from &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/11/21/licensing-the-2007-microsoft-office-user-interface.aspx"&gt;Jensen Harris's blog&lt;/a&gt;.

And since the guidelines are available on the Internet it is impossible for it not to be found in Google searches and the suchlike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry, but this is a backdoor way to legitimise the idea of software patents, where they are identified with some sort of fuzzy or not so fuzzy description of something that most probably has prior art.

I mean the MDI applications that have multiple windows and are not tabbed.  The child windows you will notice are rendered with Windows Basic even in a fully composited theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably where I should start is the "Desktop Window Manager" or in your Task Manager dwm.exe.  This is what does the Window effects, so it is not a massive re-architecture but another application providing the extra rendering effects.  This applies the effects to the main window of your application via your graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this leads into the MDI problem.  An MDI application hosts multiple windows inside one main window.  The dwm.exe provides the rendering capabilities for your main Windows, not your child windows.  This is where the problem lies, your child windows will be rendered with Aero Basic and hence look out of place in a full Aero desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this will make your application look a bit messy and inconsistent.  There is no solution as far as I can tell so far, although I am dedicated to finding an answer.  By far the simplest answer would be to make it a tabbed user interface, although this may not suit some applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I can find some sort of answer soon.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Windows Vista - The User Interface</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/20/windows-vista-user-interface.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-20T21:26:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-20:blog/2006/11/20/windows-vista-user-interface.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The user interface in Windows Vista simply doesn't feel finished.  The technology seems like it is there, but the user interface lacks consistency and the final finishing touches, an subsequently feels a bit pre-release - not the final release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Explorer doesn't have toolbars any more, no problem I suppose until you want to go up one folder.  This is beyond me, you have backwards and forwards (but it isn't a web-browser), and no toolbar of common functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most applications haven't even been touched from their earliest incarnations, see Notepad, Task Manager, Paint, and loads of others.  These are bizarrely much easier to use, but also help to confuse you more due to the lack of overall consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most applications the menu bar is hidden until you hit tab then it magically appears.  If Microsoft don't like it then they should have simply excised it from all of the default Vista applications.  I imagine lots of applications with custom drawn menus look pretty weird now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabbed property sheets and toolbars look really weird when you let Windows Vista perform the rendering.  The colours aren't quite right and this makes it look unprofessional.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately it is cumbersome and intrusive, to the point that I already have it disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When something tries to alter the registry expect at least three confirmation dialogs to get this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directory permissions are very odd, mainly due to the restructuring of how everything is stored on the main hard drive.  In order to provide a level of backward compatibility of directories symlinks are used (&lt;a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/archives/285"&gt;which aren't apparently as good as Microsoft were promising&lt;/a&gt;), but unfortunately it is completely impossible to follow them as access is always denied.  This is a pain when you want to access your program data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding where the data is actually stored, you'll end up using the search functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Microsoft have you hiding system files by default, which has been the case for years, but you always end up having to switch it on to perform basic tasks.  Unfortunately with the symlinks and the sheer amount of files it is an attempt to make it unusable.  This is trying to make people use the default because the option is so hideous rather than trying to make the option so good you simply must hide the files, which I feel is the wrong way to approach just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Windows Vista and Visual Studio 2005</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/20/windows-vista-and-visual-studio-2005.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-20T20:57:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-20:blog/2006/11/20/windows-vista-and-visual-studio-2005.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the most important aspect of my Windows Vista installation.  You have to confirm that you want to run the installation - par-for-the-course - but you have to run it as administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once installed I knew there were issues with Visual Studio 2005 and Windows Vista after the numerous warning dialogs that Windows Vista pops up.  So you use this to look at the Microsoft website like it suggests, but all you get is a place-holder.  Not really a lot of good for the developer trying to confirm all is well in Vista-Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I loaded the C++ project up and built it.  Incremental rebuilds seem completely broken for some reason, somehow the pch (pre-compiled header) gets corrupted.  Then the next problem is you can't compile individual C++ files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have tried doing is increasing the access by running the devenv.exe as administrator, that didn't seem to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought I would try out the Visual Studio 2005 SP1 Beta since it was available for download and after all couldn't make it that much more useless.  This was a nightmare to install, make sure that you run it as administrator by using the right-click context menu.  Be aware that this took an hour and a half to install, and I won't know until tomorrow whether it was successful or not.

&lt;p&gt;I can say from experience installing software is quite a pain as you have to confirm everything.  When you start to run an installer, it locks up your session until you confirm or deny.  And it actually requires a secondary click on another confirmation dialog...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realise they are trying to make Windows more secure with these extra confirmations, but it can actually become counter-productive.  Once you have seen a similar looking dialog millions of times with more or less the same text you just click automatically without reading it, simply mentally blanking it out.  This is even more dangerous, you could then be confirming anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most installers work fine on Vista though, which is a relief even if you have to confirm everything.  If you have an installation created wit &lt;a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php"&gt;Inno Setup&lt;/a&gt;, it looks fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware though - anything using Windows Installer runs terribly slow.  I guess it must be doing more work somehow.  Just be aware installing stuff requires lots of coffee breaks(!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed the problems can be fixed with a point release of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Installing Vista - Part 2 - UPDATE YOUR BIOS!</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/20/installing-vista-part-2-update-your.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-20T20:39:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-20:blog/2006/11/20/installing-vista-part-2-update-your.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I now have Vista installed after swapping computers.

The other identical twin computer, pop the disc in and bosh it is installed and looking all Aero-ey.  Even swapping the graphics cards between the two computers seems not to have helped.  This is a bizarre turn of events, especially as XP seems to have run and installed no problem.  It was not a driver problem either since it seems to have installed and understands the cards, but it seems to be an IRQ conflict of some sort, I haven't seen one of them since the old DOS days :D&lt;/p&gt;

Hopefully, it will all be solved by a clear head on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI - Enlightened Widget Library (EWL) - Enlightenment</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/17/gui-enlightened-widget-library-ewl.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-17T20:12:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-17:blog/2006/11/17/gui-enlightened-widget-library-ewl.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.enlightenment.org"&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt; project has been a cutting edge desktop environment for many years.  Although it is not seen as cutting edge any more due mainly to 3D accelerated eye candy, it is still very powerful and interesting, also it is really very efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the entire product is in heavy development but it is relatively stable (see &lt;a href="http://www.elivecd.org/"&gt;eLive to try it out with a Live CD&lt;/a&gt;).  The system is designed around a series of libraries some of which are more complete than others.  Recently it was also revealed that &lt;a href="http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/"&gt;Yellow Dog Linux&lt;/a&gt; was putting together a Linux for PS3 and it was &lt;a href="http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/news/2006/2006-10-17.shtml"&gt;using Enlightenment as the default desktop manager&lt;/a&gt;.  This also will help provide funding for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to the point of this post...  A series of tutorials have just become available for the &lt;a href="http://wiki.edevelop.org/index.php/EWL"&gt;Enlightened Widget Library (EWL)&lt;/a&gt; portion of Enlightenment.  This provides the widget toolkit for the environment.  These are introductory tutorials and can be seen here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.edevelop.org/index.php/EWL_Introduction"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.edevelop.org/index.php/EWL_Introduction_II"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.edevelop.org/index.php/EWL_Introduction_III"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main development community can be accessed &lt;a href="http://www.edevelop.org/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The way that Enlightenment has been put together shows obvious care and thought, after all you don't have to necessarily have the full desktop environment to use just some of the libraries.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Office 2007 UI Bible</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/16/office-2007-ui-bible.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-16T08:59:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-16:blog/2006/11/16/office-2007-ui-bible.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On my Internet travels I walk randomly through following links until I find something interesting.

The kind of initial flurry has died down but the substance is starting to come along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/"&gt;OpenJDK&lt;/a&gt; project is off and running.  There are two parts - the &lt;a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/compiler/"&gt;Java Compiler&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/hotspot/"&gt;Java Hotspot VM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A good place to start is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XULRunner"&gt;Wikipedia article on XULRunner&lt;/a&gt;, it provides the links you need to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XULRunner is not simply a user interface but probably could be described as a platform like Microsoft's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Application_Markup_Language"&gt;XAML/.NET&lt;/a&gt; or like &lt;a href="http://www.java.net/"&gt;Java's virtual machine&lt;/a&gt; (very loosely) or &lt;a href="http://dev.aol.com/boxely/"&gt;Boxely from AOL&lt;/a&gt;.  Essentially it provides a layer of abstraction from the underlying architecture in order to allow the developer to work on the actual coding.  XULRunner is the framework to allow standalone applications to be developed using the XUL language used for Firefox extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently &lt;a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner"&gt;XULRunner&lt;/a&gt; is in beta with version 1.8, but with version 1.9 next year they recommend that for production releases.  Along with the 1.9 release the Gecko rendering engine is also getting updated with some additional nice vector rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework provides a myriad of features.  There is built-in spell-checking, networking, the aforementioned Gecko engine, web services, storage/SQLie interfaces, UI, the ability to embed in another application, and also the Python bindings (full version forthcoming).  I think the reason that I find this quite interesting is the two applications I have used most at home and work in the past couple of years have been based on this.  I just wonder how far it can all be pushed for heavyweight desktop application development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view a list of applications based on XULRunner &lt;a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner_Hall_of_Fame"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  When the final proper release of 1.9 is out I imagine there will be more people willing to use it as it won't be all belt and braces, there can be solid tutorials and the suchlike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many of these types of projects around at the moment, I am wondering when the "survival of the fittest" will start to kick in.  Admittedly, XULRunner has a very strong chance since it is a platform for Thunderbird and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>User Interfaces - Vector Icons and Toolbars</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/14/user-interfaces-vector-icons-and.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-14T22:39:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-14:blog/2006/11/14/user-interfaces-vector-icons-and.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm sitting here wondering if there is anything out there to use vector based graphics to render some icons or toolbars.  I've been Googling for something like that out of curiosity - and I seem to have come up dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only one I have found that seems to do what I am expecting is the &lt;a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/"&gt;Juce Library&lt;/a&gt;.  In fact in most libraries creating and maintaining toolbars and icons is pretty laborious (especially in MFC), so you tend to write your own wrappers for functionality.  Myself, I have written code to automatically generate hot and disabled image lists in MFC so only one bitmap needs to be edited (I have also written this code more than once - problems of proprietary code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there is talk that Vista wants everyone to use vector icons (which is a problem for all those people who currently use bitmaps), but there seems to be very little information out there about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realise most people try to write fully featured GUI toolkits, but there must be smaller implementations of specialised functionality out there?  Kind of like common building blocks?  I suppose one would be a rendering engine using system theming, another being resource management, another rendering those resources...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>More Java</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/13/more-java.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-13T20:45:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-13:blog/2006/11/13/more-java.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple more articles to do with the open-sourcing of Java with a bit more substance.

&lt;p&gt;But that isn't what this post is about.  I've discovered an XP look and feel style for Java called &lt;a href="https://winlaf.dev.java.net/"&gt;WinLAF&lt;/a&gt; as it was felt the native look was not sufficient.  Reading about Java 6.0 though suggests that a big leap forward for native Windows look and feel is being made for this version called Mustang, also taking into account Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a myriad of enhancements for the new version of Java here including lots of alterations for Swing &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/javase6/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It links to all the related bug/enhancement reports.  An outline from &lt;a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2006/09/22/jse_bling/"&gt;The Register is also available&lt;/a&gt;.  The new rendering engine uses the Windows UxTheme DLL.&lt;/p&gt;

This is free as in freedom.  This is great news, especially in the &lt;a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_to_Pay_Novell_348_Million/1162966311"&gt;current climate brought about by Microsoft in recent weeks&lt;/a&gt; (with the &lt;a href="http://news.samba.org/announcements/team_to_novell/"&gt;Samba team now pubic in their opposition to the deal&lt;/a&gt;).  Overall, this is great news and I imagine this could push Java from strength to strength.  Pair this up with the &lt;a href="http://www.kaourantin.net/2006/11/spidermonkeys-relative-tamarin-joins.html"&gt;Adobe's EMCAScript donation to the Mozilla Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, I think this could be a very exciting time for the Java family of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has also got me thinking about Java user interfaces.  The last time I looked at them many years ago they were more of a Motif style of user-interface, certainly not the native look'n'feel.  I wondered how far they have got now.  I am a user of &lt;a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Azureus&lt;/a&gt; the fantastic BitTorrent client written in Java, the interface is not quite native, but has been getting closer and closer in each subsequent version.  Apparently it is also possible to build Azureus with the &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/"&gt;GNU Classpath library&lt;/a&gt; supplied with the &lt;a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/"&gt;GCC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There is also a look'n'feel Java website &lt;a href="http://javootoo.l2fprod.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  There certainly seems to be a lot out there that runs pretty close to being native looking, but it seems to fall short in some places, I think this warrants some more investigation...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Free Anti-Virus</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/11/free-anti-virus.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-11T09:38:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-11:blog/2006/11/11/free-anti-virus.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;UPDATED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn, I wake up this morning and switch on the computer to discover that AVG are discontinuing the &lt;a href="http://free.grisoft.com/"&gt;free edition of their anti-virus suite&lt;/a&gt; as of January 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;START UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the message as it turns out was a bit misleading.  They are discontinuing 7.1 free edition and are advising the users to update to 7.5 which is still free.  Click the link in the first paragraph to download - incidentally it uses &lt;a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org"&gt;wxWidgets&lt;/a&gt; for its user interface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;END UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a fairly decent product, especially for the price, and has meant that I don't have to install one of the myriad of Norton Security packages that I own (normally given away free with computer parts).  I suppose I could go and install those, but I am not really pleased with the software when I have used it.  Mainly due to &lt;a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; AVG Free Edition has only spotted one virus attempting to get on my PC in the past few years - and this is definitely not from being a poor anti-virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway here is a list of free alternatives for all of you in the same position:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems &lt;a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html"&gt;Avast&lt;/a&gt; is the most fully featured and professional program you could choose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.free-av.com/"&gt;Avira AntiVir&lt;/a&gt; is also a well respected free anti-virus alternative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And now an open-source alternative:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.clamwin.com/"&gt;Clamwin&lt;/a&gt; - A free open-source anti-virus engine. It is a static scanner... but pair it up with...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://winpooch.free.fr/"&gt;WinPooch&lt;/a&gt; is a dynamic monitoring engine that you can use with ClamWin which gives you all the benefits of dynamic monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that is at least a list to be getting on with.  Or you could believe &lt;a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Allchin_Suggests_Vista_Wont_Need_Antivirus/1163104965"&gt;Microsoft's Jim Allchin that you do not need Anti-virus in Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Code Jenga</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/09/code-jenga.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-09T19:39:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-09:blog/2006/11/09/code-jenga.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Imagine a game of Jenga except every fourth piece is booby-trapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why it is like a game of Jenga, you remove one piece or replace it but you run the risk of it all toppling down.  I guess that is why clean slates are probably so appealing to programmers, as you reach a state of coding entropy where it is collapsing under its own weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi there everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an update to the TortoiseSVN integration into Visual Studio 2005.  This update is a fairly major change since this will only have the changes to external tools, menus and toolbars.  This means when you import these settings you get a new menu at the top of the screen (with icons), a new toolbar with proper TortoiseSVN icons, and context menus for solutions and files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the &lt;a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/SubversionToolbarsAndMenus.zip"&gt;new settings file here&lt;/a&gt; (it is 9k in size compressed).  All you need to do is go to your Tools menu and choose "Import and Export Settings" and follow the instructions.  Ensure the tick box for which settings to import are all ticked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the original posts from the Subversion integration (and old files are still available).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/subversion-and-tortoisesvn-programmers.html"&gt;Subversion and TortoiseSVN - A programmers best friend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/subversion-tortoisesvn-integration.html"&gt;Subversion : TortoiseSVN Integration into Visual Studio&lt;/a&gt; - A vbs script that will add Subversion to your external tools in Visual Studio 2003 and 2005.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/subversion-tortoisesvn-integration_03.html"&gt;Subversion : TortoiseSVN Integration into Visual Studio.NET 2005 Again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/tortoisesvn-vsnet-2005-good-stuff.html"&gt;TortoiseSVN + VS.NET 2005 = Good Stuff&lt;/a&gt; - The original vssettings based integration with additional screenshots that still apply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/tools-for-tortoisesvn.html"&gt;Tools for TortoiseSVN&lt;/a&gt; - Some recommended tools for TortoiseSVN.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/updated-visual-studio-2005-express-and.html"&gt;Updated Visual Studio 2005 Express and TortoiseSVN Integration&lt;/a&gt; - The first update to the vssettings implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/SubversionToolbarsAndMenus.zip"&gt;DOWNLOAD SETTINGS FILE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Edit: &lt;/span&gt; Now there is a yet another update - this is now 7k.  This makes a minimum of changes to your IDE as humanly (or inhumanly) possible.  There is still a deficiency in the .vssettings that messes up the build toolbar comboboxes, but this seems unfixable in the current format.&lt;/p&gt;

Due to it being rather simplistic and essentially a one-size-fits-all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleased to see someone has developed a very comprehensive assertion library which makes it into a really useful debugging tool.  I first encountered the project with &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/library/ModAssert.asp"&gt;this article on CodeProject&lt;/a&gt;.  It allows compile time disabling/compiling out, and also run time diabling.  It also provides levels to give a granularity to your debug output.  Also you can use it to output log information which can be invaluable for debugging (with lots of useful information like threads and so on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library is fairly large and comprehensive, but since you should compile it out for your final release build it isn't really a problem at all.  It certainly should be useful for C++ developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still haven't finished my trek through the new world of Vista.  Not only the guidelines, but also getting a more in-depth look at the C API headers and getting some documentation together about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some GUI toolkits I haven't got round to looking at like the &lt;a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/"&gt;Adobe Open-Source Libraries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://smartwin.sourceforge.net/"&gt;SmartWin++&lt;/a&gt;.

At the end it linked to the blogs of the two Parakey developers &lt;a href="http://www.blakeross.com/"&gt;Blake Ross&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/"&gt;Joe Hewitt&lt;/a&gt;.  The article was abou Blake Ross but it turns out Joe Hewitt's blog was really the more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I discovered &lt;a href="http://dev.aol.com/boxely/"&gt;Boxely&lt;/a&gt;.  Joe Hewitt's posts about it are here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/boxely_is_final.php"&gt;His post about the release of Boxely.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/boxely_part_1_o.php"&gt;Boxely - Part 1.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/boxely_part_2_o.php"&gt;Boxely - Part 2.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/boxely_part_3_o.php"&gt;Boxely - Part 3.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boxely was envisioned as a lighter weight more powerful XUL type UI toolkit.  It is an XML and Javascript toolkit for creating desktop applications in the same family as XUL and XAML.  It was initially put together for the AIM client, and to allow extensibility.  Reading the articles it seems that Boxely's existence is a lucky break.  Due to being integrated with more AOL services over time it seems that it is more bloated than it started with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to be capable of some really nice graphics and also integrated animations.  I don't know how much XUL/XULRunner has improved to close the gap on the features that Boxely has.  It's almost a shame that the earlier versions were not released without the COM stuff as it all sounded pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dev.aol.com/boxely/"&gt;Boxely is available for download&lt;/a&gt; now and seems pretty capable.  I, however, don't know if it is worth investigating further as XULRunner seems to do a pretty good job with stuff like &lt;a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/"&gt;SongBird&lt;/a&gt;.  In fact I think the sentiments and vision behind the initial design is more more interesting than perhaps the final product.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Home Theatre PCs - MythTV</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/05/home-theatre-pcs-mythtv.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-05T22:35:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-05:blog/2006/11/05/home-theatre-pcs-mythtv.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org"&gt;MythTV&lt;/a&gt; is a Linux-based media centre program, but it also gives you so much more than that.  I have to say that this is better than any other media centre software out there.  Why is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been designed from the outset to provide a client/server architecture.  This probably doesn't mean much to many people at the moment, but it is certainly the way forward.  What you have is a back-end that provides the media content, then you have front-ends that allow you to access that content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest install is to have the back-end and front-end on the same computer, providing the same functionality as any other media system.  If you plan to have more than one front-end you have have the back-end on another computer, but both will be able to access it.  The back-end is also responsible for recording the TV and cataloguing the data, so you can stick a few TV cards in there and make simultaneous viewing and recordings.  And for your front-end you can make it as powerful or lightweight and silent as you want as you can limit the moving parts when the brute force (apart from decoding) is provided by the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real power comes from the client/server architecture, as the front-ends can be implemented in anything that you can connect to the &lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org/"&gt;MythTV&lt;/a&gt; protocol.  This is most apparent because it easily has a front-end for web access (meaning you can schedule your recordings remotely), there are also other smaller front-ends to the default and even a small one for Windows which is functional.  The back-end server software is pretty much rock solid because it builds on the foundations of Apache and MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently version 0.20 was released with a whole raft of new functionality including OpenGL UI rendering and a more library based architecture.  You can see the rather long &lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Release_Notes_-_0.20"&gt;changelog here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to try this out you can also do this without installing it thanks to the wonders of &lt;a href="http://www.mysettopbox.tv/knoppmyth.html"&gt;KnoppMyth&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a &lt;a href="http://www.knoppix.net/"&gt;Knoppix&lt;/a&gt; based distribution on a CD/DVD with MythTV set up so you can try it out and if you like it install it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also &lt;a href="http://swik.net/MythDora"&gt;MythDora&lt;/a&gt; a Fedora-based MythTV distribution.  This is based on Fedora Core 4, a little out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an excellent resource for getting &lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org/"&gt;MythTV&lt;/a&gt; installed for Fedora &lt;a href="http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/fcmyth.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  This is highly recommended and comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for the Ubuntu people out there, you can use &lt;a href="http://parker1.co.uk/mythtv_ubuntu.php"&gt;this resource&lt;/a&gt; to get the information you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets not forget the &lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org/modules.php?name=MythInstall"&gt;excellent documentation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt;.  You can see some &lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Category:Themes"&gt;themes here&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org/modules.php?name=MythFeatures"&gt;screenshots here&lt;/a&gt;.  Also there are thriving communities including the forums and mailing lists at MythTV itself and KnoppMyth, and there is also &lt;a href="http://www.mythtvtalk.com/"&gt;MythTV Talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I particularly like doing it fiddling about with home-made HTPCs (Home Theatre PCs).  I've built myself a little system for a little over £200 involving an AOpen XC-Cube.  This became necessary when we moved house and the main computer was moved away from the TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use Windows for the OS for expediency's sake and as the graphics chipset on the motherboard was not well supported in Linux.  I could have gone for Windows XP MCE Edition, but I already knew of an alternative I preferred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/"&gt;MediaPortal&lt;/a&gt; for a fully featured media centre system that is fully open-source.  This project actually grew out of the well respected &lt;a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.de/"&gt;XBox Media Centre (XBMC)&lt;/a&gt;.  It looks and feels great and has full compatibility with things like MCE remotes.  They've recently updated to an unstable build of 0.2.1.0 which I have found completely stable for my own uses, but I tend to only watch TV/TV programs on it.  Also, more excitingly they have started work on the TV Server project so that the TV cards and content can be hosted on a back-end server and the actual media PC can be as trimmed down as you can make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also a variety of skins to make it look really good, a lot of which broke with version 0.2.1.0 as there were some substantial changes to the XML format.  Here is a list of some working ones:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MCE is currently missing (the one that looks very similar to Windows Media Centre Edition) but will be reinstated to the release very soon (it is probably already accessible under solution).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/showthread.php?t=11947"&gt;MePo skins&lt;/a&gt; - These are fantastic featuring the new mascot type character MePo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/showthread.php?t=12133"&gt;Simplify&lt;/a&gt; - A bit of an understated skin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/files/Download/Codecs/Replicant0.2/"&gt;Replicant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/files/Download/Skins/4:3/SimpleMP-Beta1/"&gt;SimpleMP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/showthread.php?t=5212"&gt;Vista Style MCE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;KIS - Looks incredibly impressive but I have not had a chance to download and play with it yet.  There is &lt;a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/files/Download/Skins/16:9/KISbeta/"&gt;KIS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/files/Download/Skins/16:9/KIS/"&gt;KIS Dark&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/files/Download/Skins/16:9/SkinSourceFiles/KISSDK/"&gt;KIS SDK&lt;/a&gt; for plug-in pages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;MediaPortal has coverage for emulators (I had a lot of fun with this and my arcade joystick), built-in games, weather, music, DVDs, TV, radio, films, and numerous plug-ins.  Since it is also simply an application you can install and use it on any supported PC.  It may not be the most technologically advanced or have the best architecture, but it does the job more than admirably and more importantly it is as easy to use as running the installer and following the setup wizard.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Windows Vista - User Interface Solutions</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/03/windows-vista-user-interface-solutions.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-03T20:23:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-03:blog/2006/11/03/windows-vista-user-interface-solutions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I remember reading online when Apple first released their new remote with the new Intel iMacs/MacBooks/MacMinis that people said it would be no good because it didn't have enough buttons, and after all their Windows Media Centre remotes had 46 buttons, so it must be better.  But when people start using these user interfaces (after all that is what they are) I somehow doubt the 46 button monster is the winner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you are going to write something for Windows Vista?  I suppose you can jump in with both feet and see what you end up with, you might get lucky.  Or I suppose planning could be the best way forward.  When developing for any platform you need to follow the human computer interface (HCI) guidelines that give you the general rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my previous &lt;a title="guidelines post" href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/user-interface-guidelines.html"&gt;guidelines post&lt;/a&gt;   I provided links to various guides that are available.  In most cases it varies from company to company as to the UI design guidelines and if you are really unlucky it comes down to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with Windows Vista is a lack of consistency when trying to come up with design guidelines for your own project.  For such a new platform you have to look at the existing applications in order to decide what is best practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Windows XP you can see the problems already.  Look at the differences between Windows Media Player, Office 2003, Visual Studio .NET, and now IE7.  They all follow different looks, different usage paradigms, and are simply inconsistent.  For IE7 they have done away with default menu usage which is completely different to what is expected for a Windows application.  Even the way toolbars and buttons look and feel is not quite the same.  I suppose that this can be seen as paving the way for the Vista UI transition, but we are using XP not Vista.  It almost suggests there is no transition path satisfactory for both platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the eye openers when you first start using Windows Vista is a complete lack of coherency and consistency.  I know people would prefer to let their imagination run away unfettered, but guidelines are there to bring the worst applications up to the minimum standard, not drag the best ones down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of consistency is shown at its best in this &lt;a title="excellent blog post by Dave Vronay" href="http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2006/09/20/What-happened-to-the-menu-bars_3F00_.aspx"&gt;blog post by Dave Vronay&lt;/a&gt;.  In the past we have had the simple yet powerful design paradigms of menus, toolbars, and recently the more extended multifunction type toolbar (like with the search bar).  Looking at the various programs available built-in to Vista they all seem to be pulling in different directions with their usage.  Sure, not every program will be shoehorned into a limited and strict user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets have a look at three of the main applications that people will see in Windows Vista.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Internet Explorer 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;This will be the one most people see.  There seems to be odd behaviour where a new toolbar row can be inserted with just one item on it which seems to appear when there is only one tab (apparently a PDF bar I don't remember installing).  Whereas the tabs row seems to have loads of options and information crammed onto it.  The help is accessed via a chevron on the right hand side.  Menus still drop down when you select an item which has a triangle next to it.  I am finding the only thing that has really changed is the position of the menus, and they still exist but they do not have text - they use icons, and they have randomly grouped stuff together in an overcrowded tab row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IE7" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dhp3xkhx_5j9kzvc" align="bottom" border="0" height="273" hspace="0" vspace="10" width="376"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Windows Media Player 11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;This has always been the odd application out for years, looking completely different to standard window apps, with random sporadic dynamic changes to display a proper window frame or something equally as useless.  It has no toolbar as such, although it could probably be described as at the bottom of the screen...  The menu tabs across the top switch you into different views for different operations and the proper menus are hidden away on the right click if you do not choose the standard window frame.  I think it really is a case of one application trying to perform too many tasks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img title="WMP11" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dhp3xkhx_9fnm44z" align="bottom" border="0" height="348" hspace="0" vspace="10" width="450"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Office 2007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Now enter the ribbon as a menu and toolbar replacement.  This could be really good or really bad, I can't make a judgement to decide what is more productive, it might turn out to be good.  But again it is another different way of controlling your application.  If these were the way forward, surely the default Microsoft developed applications would also be going down the same route?&lt;br&gt;&lt;img title="Office 2007" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dhp3xkhx_10dtsswb" align="bottom" border="0" height="294" hspace="0" vspace="10" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, you can (or maybe not) have menu bars and/or toolbars, use tabs to switch functionality, do away with menu bars, mix up toolbars with tab bars, have icons instead of text for menu bars, or allow menu bars to pop up randomly, or use a ribbon which is kind of like a menu bar and a toolbar except more dynamic.  Confused?  You should be!  And that is only three applications!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the developers making the applications have to make a decision, what is the best course forward for their program taking into consideration the bountiful supply of ideas from Microsoft?  I can guarantee not one of them will come up with the exact same answer.  I've always followed the K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple, Stupid) philosophy, and I am not entirely sure how to apply it to this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over my next series of posts I will be digging my way through the UI guidelines of Vista and trying to navigate and at least get clear in my head the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>What to do after being ludicrously successful?</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/02/what-to-do-after-being-ludicrously.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-02T20:03:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-02:blog/2006/11/02/what-to-do-after-being-ludicrously.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/nov06/4696"&gt;Read the article: The Firefox Kid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Blake Ross helped make Firefox one of the biggest open-source success stories ever. Just wait until you see what he's up to now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the founders and perhaps they should be called visionaries of the &lt;a href="http://www.getfirefox.com"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; project has revealed what he is working on now.  It is that integration of network and personal computer into something more useful, sometimes referred to as the web-based OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is one fo the founders of the Mozilla Firefox project (if you think about it, IE completely dominated and there was noone left to fight), a self-taught programmer, a believer in open-source, and he is only 20 years old.  Kind of depressing (if you are older than him) but uplifting (something good for the future).  I recommend reading the article which kind of reveals where he is coming from and where he wants to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the idea he has is called Parakey (no website yet), and it is supposed to be integrated and synchronised storage for offline and online work, as well as sharing information over the Internet.  It is supposed to take the headaches for getting content from whatever device and storing that content for use.  It wants to be as simple as possible for managing media and allow non-technologically minded people to use those sharing services that are otherwise out of their reach.  Then the content would be accessible from the same interface whether you are on your home computer or any other around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like a decent idea providing it can come to fruition, but these things don't always live up to the grand dreams.  It's an interesting interview anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Open-Source wxWidgets IDE - wxDevC++</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/11/01/open-source-wxwidgets-ide-wxdev-c.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-11-01T20:22:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-11-01:blog/2006/11/01/open-source-wxwidgets-ide-wxdev-c.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a previous post I have mentioned the splendid free IDE &lt;a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/"&gt;Code::Blocks&lt;/a&gt;, but in the dark old days of a few years ago, before Microsoft gave stuff away for free and development was quite an expensive endevour, there existed &lt;a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html"&gt;DevC++&lt;/a&gt;.  It was a free IDE written in Delphi that provided good library management and also was an IDE for GCC in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years other IDEs have sprung up and essentially overtaken Dev-C++ in terms of features and quality.  Then someone decided to make a branch, one that was going to have integrated GUI editing.  This project eventually became &lt;a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/"&gt;wxDevC++&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new version has just been released with even more features from wxWidgets integrated into the GUI editor.  Most importantly it now has support for Visual C++ compilers (v6, 2003, and 2005) which is interesting.  I need to go and check out this IDE in more detail, but it is good to see it is more than alive and kicking.  If you are a wxWidgets developer it is one of the most comprehensive integrated IDEs for developing and looks like it will be going from strength to strength judging from the &lt;a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/changelog.php#610"&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; for this version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is a little screenshot with the GUI editor up from their &lt;a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/1600/thumbnail.png"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/320/thumbnail.png" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>User Interface Guidelines</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/31/user-interface-guidelines.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-31T22:05:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-31:blog/2006/10/31/user-interface-guidelines.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another stop on the way to a fuller look at the Vista User Interface Guidelines.  This will be the last one I promise...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;WINDOWS XP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For designing any user interface in Windows XP (and generally Windows) you need to know &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch14e.asp"&gt;Design Specifications and Guidelines - Visual Design&lt;/a&gt;.  This specifies how you are supposed to lay out your user interface and how allthe elements should fit together.  I use this to hand code my resources for MFC user interfaces, when it is all consistent you will be surprised how much better and more professional it looks.  One thing I can't remember if it is covered is make sure your tab order is correct as when working with resources it is possible to get it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;VISTA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/UxGuide/UXGuide/Home.asp"&gt;Windows Vista User Experience Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; have been available for a while.  By available I mean exist as a placeholder that someone will eventually be forced to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most substantive part of the Vista UI Guidelines is the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/UxGuide/UXGuide/Resources/TopRules/TopRules.asp"&gt;Top Rules for the Windows Vista User Experience&lt;/a&gt; which are extremely shallow and a bit of a red herring for good UI design.  It even asks for things that the applications provided with Windows Vista are unable to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the Vista guideline are so shallow that even the most obvious things like what will be the user interface differences between Basic and other Vista versions are not covered.  For those of you that haven't heard the standard home version of Vista will be supplied with the "Aero Basic" theme that does not have the bells and whistles.  It makes no mention of how to lay out controls consistently and intuitively.  Also it says use Vista style icons and so on, unfortunately the icon guidelines hve not been published yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;APPLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; to show you how it is done.  They have comrehensive developer documentation on how to supply a well integrated consistent interface for OS X.  They can be read &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human interface guidelines are available &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  This covers all you need to know for a professional looking OS X application.  The documents keep evolving and get better like with the recent &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGIcons/chapter_14_section_2.html"&gt;icon addition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Gnome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gnome desktop has a well know &lt;a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/2.0/"&gt;human interface guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.  It is really quite in-depth and puts Microsoft to shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;KDE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular Linux desktop environment also has a set of &lt;a href="http://developer.kde.org/documentation/standards/kde/style/basics/index.html"&gt;user interface guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read a previous post about icon guidelines for various platforms &lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/icons-icons-icons.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Windows Vista GUI - Gotta start thinking about it</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/31/windows-vista-gui-gotta-start-thinking.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-31T21:46:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-31:blog/2006/10/31/windows-vista-gui-gotta-start-thinking.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Windows Vista is just around the corner.  As a developer you worry about what a new OS version is going to do to the program you work on, most incremental cases are pretty trivial, XP introduced a virtually undocumented theming API (and it still pretty much is), SP2 opened up a whole can of pain, Vista has even bigger problems on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this post isn't about those migration problems, I'll be covering them as I tear my hair out at work, much like my migrations to Visual Studio 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this GUI developer's point of view I'll cover my thought process:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Does my UI work under this upgraded platform?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignoring the platform issues, does the user interface work on the new platform.  This means does it render without causing corruption and does it crash?  It's a simple case of running the executable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Does it look good?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the user interface is usable, does it look integrated with the rest of the system?  This means checking custom draw items work and match the system theme.  Once you've made sure you have made no glaring errors the program is probably usable on the new platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Does it look consistent with other programs on that platform?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is where the realy hard work start.  Some platforms actually provide user interface (HCI) guidelines that are worth the virtual paper they are written on like the Apple ones, some are not like Vista.  My next post will cover this point in greater detail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Has the migration made our user's lives better or easier?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has the shiny new look cheered our user's lives up?  Has it made the user's lives easier, say for instance the new common controls provide even more functionality as standard?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"What can be added incrementally?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are there new features available to the developers that can be added in an incremental fashion, either phasing out old items or introducing new paradigms.  This will also be the implementation of features seen as extras by the HCI guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Can you separate yourself from the crowd?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the lowest priority item.  Are there things you can do that look good, but also serve to separate you from the rest of the crowd (but please keep them within the HCI guidelines, PLEASE!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Well, I will end this random ramble though my thought processes, but I am expending valuable brain power on this knowing I have to sort this out in the near future.  Since Vista is going to manufacturers very soon it all seems tangible now.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - qooxdoo</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/28/gui-toolkits-qooxdoo.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-28T21:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-28:blog/2006/10/28/gui-toolkits-qooxdoo.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;No, I haven't lost all typing skills, it is really called qooxdoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://qooxdoo.org/"&gt;qooxdoo&lt;/a&gt; (see also &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qooxdoo"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) is an AJAX targetted Javascript user interface toolkit.  It is surprisingly fully featured and shows how far along web-based toolkits have come.  Well, when I say surprising, I mean shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toolkit is LGPL licensed and has a large set of widgets available.  I think the best way to describe it is to send you to the demo page &lt;a href="http://qooxdoo.org/demo"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and I would recommend you look at &lt;a href="http://demo.qooxdoo.org/html/at-a-glance/index.html"&gt;this example&lt;/a&gt; in particular.  There is no point in looking at the screenshots as playing round with the demos demonstrates its depth of features and how polished they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of this kit for web development include the abstraction away of web browser specifics and automatic browser detection.  It has things that are normally only seen in fully fledged desktop environments like drag-n-drop support.  Like I said earlier though I think the demos speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - Evaluation</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/28/gui-toolkits-evaluation.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-28T09:15:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-28:blog/2006/10/28/gui-toolkits-evaluation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I reckon I am probably in the minority here, but I am less concerned about the code format of GUI toolkits.  I am more concerned about what it is capable of and what it looks and feels like.  After all it is more than possible to write an abstraction layer on top of it to hide some of the less nice features, and adapting to different styles is a learning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst screenshots can be misleading or more often understating the abilities of a toolkit, a well-defined example application is more than enough to decide whether to evaluate further.  With online type user interfaces it is much easier, whereas you need an executable to try things out for most others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's surprising how few go down this route as it is such a good way to show how good an application is on your platform.  I thought I would put together a list of some you can check out now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/"&gt;JUCE&lt;/a&gt; - The JUCE demos are downloadable &lt;a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/download.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wxpython.org/"&gt;wxPython&lt;/a&gt; - There is the wxPython demo available &lt;a href="http://www.wxpython.org/download.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Unzip, and you will have an app called begin.exe. Start it. It runs 1 example using their .adam and .eve files. To try out other UI examples, drag a pair of .adam and .eve files from the examples directory onto the main app window (the wide-short window), and it loads up a new window from the .adam and .eve form file specs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  I had played with this a little but the drag and drop changing of the UI completely escaped me(!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;qooxdoo - The Javascript based toolkit has lots of examples that you can check out through your browser &lt;a href="http://qooxdoo.org/demo"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I've probably missed a stack of them, but I'll try to find some more.

It seems that although it is relatively easy to get it compiled there is a lot of performance and stability work to be undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posts are:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/boost-library-and-visual-studio-2005.html"&gt;Boost and VS2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/visual-studio-2005-lets-break.html"&gt;VS2005 floating point and STL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;There is also one area that needs looking at as you may notice you are not getting the Windows XP look and feel.  This is a pain because the way manifests work has changed.  You need to go to your &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;stdafx.h&lt;/span&gt; file or the main &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;.cpp&lt;/span&gt; file and add the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting make sure you check out the &lt;a href="http://vcf-online.org/docs/ref_manual/ch01.html"&gt;list of features&lt;/a&gt; from the VCF documentation, as I won't repeat them all here (after all it is what hyperlinking is invented for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three core libraries in the VCF:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;FoundationKit&lt;/span&gt; - The base library for the VCF providing the lower level building blocks for the other libraries.  It provides the RTTI system, string support, threading, and much more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;GraphicsKit&lt;/span&gt; - It's the library that provides the graphic rendering and graphics formats.  It has some great functionality from &lt;a href="http://www.antigrain.com/"&gt;libAGG (The Anti-Grain Geometry Tookit)&lt;/a&gt; which I have mentioined in some previous posts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;ApplicationKit&lt;/span&gt; - The GUI functionality itself.  Obviously this is the largest component and covers the widgets, events, focus, and more.  It's almost so big there must be a thought to break it down further into smaller functional components.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;There are more libraries (kits) that contribute functionality including HTML, OpenGL, the upcoming Regex, and a few more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One compaint I hear is that the libraries are too large (in file size) which I have never understood as an argument for or against a toolkit (unless we are talking MASSIVE).  It is rare that a toolkit has a small amount of dependencies, plus with the VCF you don't need everything if you are into that (but it is obviously more work to do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found writing code in VCF is surprisingly concise and easy to understand.  If you have come from an MFC or wxWidgets background, the event system will need some understanding.  I was trying out writing something to simulate docking with a small amount of success, although I haven't done as much coding for it as I probably should have.  It wasn't more than a little experiment to try out something in the VCF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably should list the major features that it lacks, which are docking windows (and toolbars), fully implemented cross-platform support, scripting language bindings (&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Edit:&lt;/span&gt; There is a basic Javascript engine that has not made it into the release yet), and the finished documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cross platform aspect remains incomplete for Linux and Mac although the Linux version has pushed on in the recent past.  Actually I find it a bit disappointing that it does not have a large community built up around it like some other toolkits.  The foundations seem so solid that the system is begging to be extended more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you read the documentation &lt;a href="http://vcf-online.org/docs/ref_manual/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which is excellent although not comprehensive, and not completely finished.  Also check out the VCF articles on the &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/"&gt;CodeProject&lt;/a&gt; (do a search for VCF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can tell I am quite positive about this toolkit, it is almost too understated for its own good.  I can imagine developing something quite complex in it and being able to extend it for more complex things.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Firefox v2.0</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/24/firefox-v20.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-24T09:07:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-24:blog/2006/10/24/firefox-v20.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; is addictive, and gives a wealth of useful information, like 75% of the readers here use &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;.  Firefox 2.0 comes the same week as &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx"&gt;Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0&lt;/a&gt; has arrived.  So there are two installation experiences to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IE7 starts installation by unpacking the installation to a temporary directory, and then begins some enforced Windows Updates.  Then it begins an unusually long installation (I am still not sure why), overall taking 10-15 minutes.  Then it needs you to reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to wait for automatic updates to pick up Firefox 2.0, but I decided to upgrade now.  The installation was a case of blink and you'll miss it.  No reboot.  A minor startup delay of about ten seconds due to checking the plug-ins for updates, and I was away.  The new UI takes a bit of getting used to visually, but I think I will end up preferring it, and it pretty much all works the same.  The tab shading is a bit unnecessary especially since the rest of the UI isn't as shaded.

&lt;p&gt;If you decide to give it a go make sure you use the &lt;a href="http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=d5fa3b82510a71c14c07404cb09e1492&amp;board=20.0"&gt;Nightly Builds&lt;/a&gt;, you'll need &lt;a href="http://www.7-zip.org/"&gt;7-zip&lt;/a&gt; to decompress the files as well.  The nightly builds are well beyond the last "release" called RC2.  I've found the nightly builds stable and mature.  There are lots of plug-ins and project templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major plug-ins that has recently gone through a major rewrite is the wxSmith plug-in which is a visual GUI designer for the IDE.  If this turns out to be good or even just average it would give Code::Blocks a major advantage for adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code::Blocks is able to be the IDE for a variety of &lt;a href="http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php?title=Installing_a_supported_compiler"&gt;compiler back-ends&lt;/a&gt;.  I completely forgot to mention it is cross-platform.  It seems to scale up pretty well to larger projects, and can even convert your Visual Studio solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

These look like add-ins that will become part of the core toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up there is &lt;a href="http://www.kirix.com/community/wxaui.html"&gt;wxAUI (wxWidgets Advanced User Interface)&lt;/a&gt; which provides a really nice and simple docking toolkit.  It has great looking hint boxes for docking and the ability to use transparency for drag effects.  It also has a notebook style tabbed interface built into it, and provides toolbar docking which is really top notch.  This is now part of the main &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=9863"&gt;2.7 development distribution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxflatnotebook"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wxFlatNoteBook&lt;/a&gt; is a tabbed "notebook" interface much like what you see in Visual Studio (or indeed &lt;a href="http://www.codeblocks.org"&gt;Code::Blocks&lt;/a&gt; which uses it).  It has lots of professional looking rendering and custom drawn styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wxforum.shadonet.com/viewtopic.php?t=10497"&gt;wxFlatMenu&lt;/a&gt; has just been released on the wxWidgets forums.  This provides custom drawn menus much like what you see in Windows XP applications like Office and Visual Studio (both 2003/2005 and 2007 look).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wxFlatNoteBook and wxFlatMenu have not been put into the main trunk, but there are plans afoot to integrate both into the wxAUI interface.  With this collection of very decent extensions it opens up wxWidgets to more possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - Ultimate++</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/22/gui-toolkits-ultimate.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-22T15:25:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-22:blog/2006/10/22/gui-toolkits-ultimate.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly new toolkit on the scene, but that doesn't make it particularly lacking.  I have been scouring the Internet for unbiased reviews of most toolkits before downloading them and it is seriously hard to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://upp.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Ultimate++&lt;/a&gt; is more than just a GUI toolkit (in fact I could probably say that about every single one I have looked at), it has an IDE, a build system, a visual designer, code-completion, code documentation, and its own standard library.  As a compiler back-end it can use &lt;a href="http://www.mingw.org"&gt;Mingw&lt;/a&gt;, Visual Studio Toolkit 2003, and &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/"&gt;Visual C++ 2005 Express&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that you are unable to use your IDE of choice as Ultimate++ is more of a platform than simply a library.  TheIDE does allow you to simplify starting up development in Ultimate++ since you don't have to worry too much about environmental setup and they don't have to support multiple IDEs.  TheIDE is OK as a development environment, it lacks a plug-in framework that I could find but it does have a macro language.  This means integration of external development tools seems difficult which I find useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis of Ultimate++ is the NTL which is a replacement for STL due to their perceived deficiencies for the project.  I honestly can't say if it is a giant leap forward or reinventing the wheel, I've heard these arguments in the past that turn out to be null and void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on to the most interesting part - the actual GUI Toolkit.  It has a fairly modest collection of widgets, not as deep as more mature toolkits.  I have noticed it is possible to get a fair amount of flicker from the projects when resizing and a simple solution didn't immediately present itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user interface is not actually built on the common controls of the operating system, but is custom drawn, and as such in previous versions did not match the widgets of the underlying system in all cases.  This has improved massively recently (gone away completely I believe) thanks to a new Chameleon theming engine that uses the operating system UI theming engine (uxtheme on Windows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I feel about Ultimate++ is that it is a decent new stab at something a little different to the other UI libraries by making it more of a platform.  I don't think it is ready if you are evaluating it for use in a big application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me when I read &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;"Rapid development is achieved by the smart and aggressive use of C++ rather than through fancy code generators"&lt;/span&gt; I thought it was interesting, but I always take this kind of stuff with a pinch of salt.  The code although shorter in a manner of speaking I don't think is any more readable, and doesn't really show any reduction in programmer thought or time (if you are comparing to more modern toolkits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity of the community seems fairly large, so they may be able to add functionality faster than other toolkits.

&lt;p&gt;I've made an update to the TortoiseSVN integration for Visual Studio 2005.  This is from a comment by Dean about adding a solution to the repository.  This has been added to the menu, toolbar, and context menu for solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this update has only been tested on Visual C++ 2005 Express for the moment as this is all I have to hand, but I am pretty sure these settings should also work for Visual Studio full versions (see the link at the end of this post).  I'll update the Visual Studio 2005 Pro versions at some point during the week, or discover I don't need to and only maintain one file (which would mean not going grey as fast).&lt;/p&gt;

In some of my previous posts I've been going on about the web GUI, allowing the browser to be come the front end.  Although this looks like a really good project it probably doesn't go the whole hog as it is a web-browser in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses the Mozilla libraries as a foundation to build a web-browser with integrated music/media functionality, or maybe it is media program with an integrated web-browser?  The advantages of using the Mozilla framework is that it is cross-platform and it is a proven technology.  It is also designed around the Firefox design of a core product with extensions to add functionality.  To that end there are plug-ins for iTunes libraries and syncing iPods.  One of the driving forces behind it is the guy behind the original WinAmp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the artwork produced for the site is excellent quality and highly amusing(!) which wins points with me.  Maybe I'm just shallow.  I'll be watching this project though as it is really an interesting integration of a heavyweight application and the web.  Click the image below to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately as it currently stands such a library is further away than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A project that wanted to succeed is the &lt;a href="http://www.crystalclearsoftware.com/cgi-bin/boost_wiki/wiki.pl?BoostGUI"&gt;BoostGUI&lt;/a&gt; library.  Unfortunately it has never got out of the research stage, let alone the planning stage.  It was envisioned to be the &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org"&gt;Boost Library&lt;/a&gt; addition to make GUI development at least have one standard.  The research page (click on the &lt;a href="http://www.crystalclearsoftware.com/cgi-bin/boost_wiki/wiki.pl?BoostGUI"&gt;BoostGUI&lt;/a&gt; link) though provides great avenues for people wanting to know more about GUI development, some of the conversations on mailing lists that the wiki links to are excellent and thought-provoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how all of this will work in ten years time.  It was certainly an admirable aim, but with technologies like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL"&gt;XUL&lt;/a&gt; getting more traction and getting more mature, the answer may come from a completely different direction to what all of these toolkits are aiming to do.  They'll provide a simple cross-platform framework that will get added to over time and eventually have the richness of user interface abilities required by heavier applications.  Certainly I don't think these types of libraries can be designed from scratch to be everything, and they have to grow, whereas most GUI toolkits have gaping holes in "to be implemented" areas, whereas the simpler domains mean you can easily get 100% coverage and then add more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't believe this, over the past few weeks I have been talking myself out of heavyweight GUI toolkits...  Scary stuff.  Don't get me wrong these toolkits are still my primary interest for any GUI development, but I wonder what the future could hold as web development has really started to spped up.  We all need not only to think of this new &lt;a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm"&gt;multi-core future&lt;/a&gt; but also the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX"&gt;web-based platform&lt;/a&gt; future.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - JUCE</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/18/gui-toolkits-juce.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-18T11:03:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-18:blog/2006/10/18/gui-toolkits-juce.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On my trawl through GUI toolkits and my general web browsing I have encountered the name &lt;a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/"&gt;Juce&lt;/a&gt; from time to time.

&lt;p&gt;Successes certainly have been:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt"&gt;Qt&lt;/a&gt; - thanks mainly to being used by KDE to bring it right into the developer consciousness.

The comprehensive nature of this library and its maturity helps to draw people in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whatever Microsoft technology they are pushing today - WinForms?  Avalon?  Sheer commercial brute force will get people dumping whatever they were told to use last time in droves and get them to implement it in Microsoft's Golden Child Of The Moment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gtk.org/"&gt;GTK+&lt;/a&gt; is being used in Gnome.  It is certainly well-developed and well-used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In fact it is quite scary how few commercial GUI toolkits there are out there.  You are normally given a low-level set of APIs from the desktop environment and if you are lucky you get a higher-level API (which will definitely not be cross-platform designed).&lt;/p&gt;

It's certainly necessary to understand it for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more interesting application of these new UI features are how the cross-platform toolkits going to incorporate them (and indeed whether some of it is so useless that it shouldn't be incorporated).  I don't think that the toolkits will struggle to keep up since each time operating system UIs try to diverge they always end up converging.  I do think that the way these toolkits expand will show which ones are the best designed (you know, the extra functionalty being less kludgey).&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately it is not as well documented as I would like (although it is in a much beter state with some recent work), and also difficult to maintain.  It has been fun messing around with Lex and Yacc, but Parser Generator 2 hasn't been updated since 2003 so I had to spend some time getting it ready for Visual Studio 2005 (I don't know what will happen for 64 bit...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly this is not an ideal situation, but when this macro language was first dropped in there was not quite the thriving community of different scripting languages available.  I find the whole scripting language thing intensely interesting, so I thought I'd ruminate on a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is well-known, mature and well respected programming language.  It was designed as a programming language not a scripting language so it has a really solid foundation, as it is always harder to retrofit complexity rather than preparing for it at the start.  It has been used in the web domain extensively as well as embedding and a programming language in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is really extensible with a well defined C API, and also this API allows you to embed an interpreter within your program.  There are arguments that you should extend and not embed Python as a language, but this is a moot point as the design of your program will normally dictate the course you take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending the language with your own C++ functionality is almost trivial thanks to projects like &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/python"&gt;Boost Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.swig.org/"&gt;SWIG&lt;/a&gt;. There are also many other tools for extending and embedding.  I am definitely a big fan of Boost Python after success playing with it and understanding how it all fits together (and I don't forget I promised to go into more detail on setting it up and designing your program around it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python extensions also include the absolutely brilliant &lt;a href="http://www.wxpython.org/"&gt;wxPython&lt;/a&gt; which exposes the wxWindows library.  The thing about wxPython is that it is widely regarded as a better API than the actual macro based &lt;a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org"&gt;wxWidgets&lt;/a&gt; C++ API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lua.org/"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was designed as a scripting language.  It is lightweight and fast.  The language has grown to accomodate the features people wanted or needed, and the community around it is massive and thriving.  It is normally the option people go for when they consider Python too "heavyweight", and as such is popular with game developers (for instance the MMORPG Worlds Of Warcraft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This language also has an excellently designed way of binding C++ to the language called &lt;a href="http://luabind.sourceforge.net/"&gt;LuaBind&lt;/a&gt;.  This is born from the same roots as the Boost Python design, there are plans afoot for the &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=34093"&gt;Boost Langbinding&lt;/a&gt; project (which would also encompass binding to other languages like &lt;a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also many other tools and more available from the &lt;a href="http://lua-users.org/"&gt;community&lt;/a&gt;, make sure you take a look at the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.squirrel-lang.org"&gt;Squirrel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit I have been keeping an eye on this project.  It was born from someone's frustrations with Lua and they created their own language.  It's a young language, but it is surprisingly robust and mature for its age.  The active maintenance also means that it is always working for the latest compilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is so new it does lack the size of community, but it does have some nice tools.  Squirrel has a C++ language binding tool like LuaBind and Boost Python called &lt;a href="http://wiki.squirrel-lang.org/default.aspx/SquirrelWiki/SqPlus.html"&gt;SqPlus&lt;/a&gt; which is never normally far behind the release of Squirrel.  I recommend going to have a look at the &lt;a href="http://wiki.squirrel-lang.org/"&gt;Squirrel Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for a lot more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that is three languages so far.  Others include &lt;a href="http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/"&gt;AngelScript&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.somedude.net/gamemonkey/"&gt;GameMonkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nicollet.net/meta/xhed"&gt;XHed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://eosscript.sourceforge.net/"&gt;EO scripting language&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html"&gt;Guile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/"&gt;Javascript&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm"&gt;Pawn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.iolanguage.com/about/"&gt;io&lt;/a&gt;, and no doubt I am missing some others.

This is in a lead up to version 2.8, which will be the latest stable version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version of &lt;a href="http://wxpack.sourceforge.net"&gt;wxPack&lt;/a&gt; has not been released yet, but the new version will probably be out soon and no doubt feature &lt;a href="http://www.wxformbuilder.org/"&gt;wxFormBuilder v3&lt;/a&gt; (the new version of a GUI builder).&lt;/p&gt;

I referred to it as XML and Javascript to render a web page (not using XSLT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I've completely missed the point, but the only difference between what AJAX is now (in simplistic terms) and what I did a while back was the way the XML was being retrieved.  Admittedly my Javascript was way simpler than these new flashy whizz-bang sites, but the same data/view separation was there.  I am pretty sure it was referred to as DHTML (although I think that also encompassed &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript"&gt;VBScript&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit these Javascript platforms are really impressive, especially as the browser support gets better, like with WYSIWYG editors embedded in webpages which is what I am typing this with.  I just realised this post seemed a bit negative, but I think it's all FANTASTIC!

It was easy to compile in Visual C++ Express 2005, but most importantly the resizing is silky smooth (an odd thing to say is important, but it really impressed me).  Most importantly the webpage has a link to &lt;a href="http://www.zod2008.com/"&gt;Zod 2008&lt;/a&gt;, you know who to vote for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VCF is an almost cross-platform GUI toolkit, in that the Mac and Linux implementations are not complete yet.  It is based on modern C++ and uses a signals/slots type event system.  What made this so easy to evaluate was that I could load the solution into Visual C++ Express 2005 and kick off a build.  And with my Core 2 Duo upgrade I made recently, it whizzed through the compilation of over 100 projects.  I was using the &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; trunk so a couple of the newer examples didn't compile, not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a bit of a leap for me to try it out as it was well out of the "similar to MFC" comfort zone, but getting some code up and running was trivial.  There are so many examples that it can be difficult deciding which example provides the best template for a solution to your design.  There is an online book describing lots of the VCF which although it is not finished is pretty informative, plus the source code documentation is likewise pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this a well-designed package as well, as it was not just simply a monolithic library, it was split into components.  This also makes it much easier to implement cross-platform versions of it as there is a porting guide on the &lt;a href="http://vcf-online.org/forums/"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;.  There are some well written extensions as well with the graphics kit using the splendid &lt;a href="http://www.antigrain.com/"&gt;Anti-Grain Geometry Library (libAGG)&lt;/a&gt;, networking, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started posting some questions on the forums because from the website and forums it looked a pretty quiet project, but I think it is just a case of appearances being deceiving.  The main developer Jim Crafton (ddiego) drives it on with loads and loads of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows version of the VCF is definitely mature enough to develop with, and looking at it I am surprised it does not have a more thriving community as it seems to have all the right ingredients.  Some of these things are probably down to luck not judgement I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>A Great Collection Of Libraries</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/11/plethora-of-useful-links.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-11T21:47:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-11:blog/2006/10/11/plethora-of-useful-links.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while back I found a really great website for game development libraries.

&lt;p&gt;And now I have just signed up for:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spreadsheets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writely&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;It's great all these things are free and freely provided, but now I think I am getting too reliant on it all...  Admittedly I only use some of the things I am signed up to, and signed up to other things just to try them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wasn't going to discuss my addiction to trying things out.  Something occurred to me when I was looking at the new &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/"&gt;Google Office&lt;/a&gt;, browsers are providing all this functionality, but we are still using an ancient paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft are releasing Internet Explorer 7.0 very soon, and it is attempting to catch up with Firefox by adding features like tabbed browsing, but it is just playing catch-up to an idea that was born before all of the AJAX applications started leaping out of the woodwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these AJAX applications become more prevalent the web browser starts to become a hindrance.  Do you use multiple tabs or do you use multiple windows, and how do you arrange and manage those windows (especially since they all have the same taskbar icon)?  Are the bookmark user interfaces moving with the times?  The web browser needs a rethink for these new uses as it is still designed more for viewing static data (and now that is only part of its repetoire, a specialisation of its more generalised use).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most web browsers have their rendering engine a different layer, so that is easy to break out.  Do these applications become a separate window?  Do we get a new kind of application launcher?  I've never really put much thought into it as until recently I never saw the web as a platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly I am finding the current browser technology very limiting as tabbed browsing, multiple windows, bookmarks are not allowing me to use all of these new applications to their maximum potential.  Just having GMail and Blogger open in web browsers is harder than it should be to manage as I have to do a double take on the task bar or think before switching tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the web browser needs a rethink, or maybe my ideas aren't so outlandish...  The main web browser application is some sort of navigator/task bar and the pages are shown in their own easily recognisable windows, perhaps even without borders as they currently exist.  I suppose some of these ideas are being integrated into these new "sidebars" in operating systems, but do they go far enough and take the new AJAX applications into account?&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - wxWidgets</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/10/gui-toolkits-wxwidgets.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-10T14:45:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-10:blog/2006/10/10/gui-toolkits-wxwidgets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org"&gt;wxWidgets&lt;/a&gt; is the 800lb gorilla in the open source GUI toolkit arena.  It goes well beyond being simply about the GUI and spreads into all areas of application development, from networking to database to threading to strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't such a large leap from MFC to wxWidgets.  They are born from the design of macros and simple classes, and this is not as large a problem as sometimes it is made out to be, some people find it easier, some find it harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the easiest way to get up and running is to use &lt;a href="http://wxpack.sourceforge.net/"&gt;wxPack&lt;/a&gt; if you are using Visual Studio, or give &lt;a href="http://www.codeblocks.org"&gt;Code::Blocks&lt;/a&gt; a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer breadth and depth of the project is amazing, and it keeps spreading further with more and more contributions.  What I have noticed over the past year is that it has really started to take off with millions of additions like wxAUI (docking toolkit), wxFlatNoteBook (a tab control window container like Visual Studio has), wxPDFDocument, wxSQLite3, and in the past few days wxSkin (a potential skinning package).  The website is also much better with a &lt;a href="http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://wxforum.shadonet.com/"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;, and this week a &lt;a href="http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.  Google Summer of Code seems to have been a success for wxWidgets as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly have had some success with it writing a test program embedding an &lt;a href="http://www.ogre3d.org"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt; rendering context into a docking user interface to try out wxAUI.  It looked impressive although didn't accomplish much...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before making this post too long I will go into more depth in wxWidgets another time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits - Win32GUI Generics</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/09/gui-toolkits-win32gui-generics.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-09T21:37:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-09:blog/2006/10/09/gui-toolkits-win32gui-generics.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.torjo.com/win32gui/"&gt;Win32GUI Generics Homepage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I found this project I thought I had found the holy grail.  An advanced use of C++ for user interface purposes.  I looked past the screenshots on the website which seemed odd, but downloaded it anyway.  The last release of the project and any active development was nearly a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It certainly pressed all the right buttons for me.  It was a wrapper for the Win32 API with aspirations to be cross-platform.  I encountered my first set of problems when I tried to get it to compile, you shouldn't use the solution files for Visual Studio.  There is a "build library" utility that works with Visual C++ 8.0.  I got a few examples up and running with minor project file tweaks like include directories, and found that custom draw buttons were not XP themed so I hacked in a small theming API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All seems okay so far.  The biggest problem I found was the resizing, it caused massive amounts of flicker.  Having solved a lot of similar problems in MFC I tried to get it to flicker less with no success.  Then attempting lots of other examples I found they simply crashed or would not compile.  Most disappointing was I could not have a look at the new "Surfaces" version of the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compiled size of the library is massive with large amounts of global static data.  I found building a bit pot-luck.  I had to configure the Boost Jam files to not use iterator debugging or safe iterators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is I really like this library and it seems really powerful, but simultaneously lacks a little robustness.  There is a lot of work to be done on this library to make it ready for the primetime which is really unfortunate.  John Torjo definitely deserves a pint of beer for fantastic and thought provoking work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great little article about it &lt;a href="http://blog.davber.com/2006/07/10/win32-for-real-c-developers/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>GUI Toolkits Again - a bit of MFC</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/09/gui-toolkits-again-bit-of-mfc.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-09T19:58:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-09:blog/2006/10/09/gui-toolkits-again-bit-of-mfc.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At work, I only use MFC and the antiquated design features in Visual Studio for working on resources.  These interfaces still feel like they haven't moved on for a lifetime (and are in fact pretty much unchanged from Visual Studio 6.0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most annoying part about working with the resources is I have to resort to handcoding most of the time.  It is especially necessary in order to follow the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch14e.asp"&gt;Official Guidelines for User Interface Developers and Designers&lt;/a&gt; (self-inflicted myself, but you need some level of consistency).  Also the IDE design features have an uncanny knack for orphaned &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;#defines&lt;/span&gt; and controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MFC doesn't really feel like an API as most of the stuff I want to do I end up having to subclass and write lots of specific code.  There are subclasses for just about every type of control, and in that a lot of it is direct access to the Win32 API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I don't have an intense hatred for MFC like a lot of developers.  It seems to serve its purpose well, and there are so many extensions and large applications built on it.  I don't think Microsoft envisioned being unable to kill it off because it is used by too many applications.  It will still be developed and have some new "managed" features which strikes me as odd...  MFC is a thin wrapper around the Win32 API, but .NET is a wrapper around the Win32 API, so there would be a double level of indirection for these new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people would love to migrate away from MFC, but they are too integrally tied into their applications.  The cause of that is normally the initial codebase grew from a small code-generated wizard application.  I know I would love to do move away from MFC, but it is first necessary to find a new GUI toolkit that is capable of doing every feature you have probably handcoded in extensions to MFC, or if you have to write the extensions yourself it is no more difficult to do than the first time you wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is part of the reason to really look in depth at GUI toolkits.  It is really necessary to find one that will allow the most active development by the virtue of being easy to pick up.  Also, the grass is not always greener on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Open Source GUI toolkits</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/07/open-source-gui-toolkits.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-07T16:57:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-07:blog/2006/10/07/open-source-gui-toolkits.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things I really want to check out over the next few weeks are open-source GUI toolkits.

The last time I went &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;"Ooooooh!"&lt;/span&gt; was when I bought a Voodoo card for 3D graphics (it wasn't even integrated into graphics cards at the time) for a Pention 200MMX.  The smoothness and difference in response was amazing.  I suppose the incremental steps all add up and the comparison with a few years ago is noticable, but nothing really blew my socks off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was until we got a top of the range two processor (each with two cores) Core 2 Duo (Xeon).  Bloody hell, I have never seen such a leap in speed ever!  Operations that took days before now take hours, and even when it is a single process (we work on a full multithreading program) it has a massive performance gain in the order of 50%, and  there are three cores still left idle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always bought Athlon processors for my home PC builds mainly because they were cost-effective and powerful.  But I have broken with tradition and picked myself up a Core 2 Duo 6400 processor and a new motherboard (which has both AGP and PCI-Ex slots) from my Athlon XP 3200+.  For general websurfing I don't notice any difference until I try to compile something.  I am currently compiling a 114 project solution in Visual Studio in the background whilst I am typing this and it is hammering through and took about five to ten minutes to do(!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can say is if you do development the Core 2 Duo processors really make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Boost Python</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/06/boost-python.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-06T13:04:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-06:blog/2006/10/06/boost-python.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few posts ago I wrote up how to compile the Boost Library and also Boost::Python with Visual C++ 2005 Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boost::Python is a fantastic tool for binding your C++ functionality to the Python scripting language.  You just need to write some extra small templates to expose classes, functions and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that bothered me about Boost Python is the need to use &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;bjam&lt;/span&gt; to build the resulting &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;.pyd&lt;/span&gt; file.  It complicates it all quite a lot, especially if you have not been using bjam.exe to compile your project anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I discovered with a little bit of experimentation is that the PYD file is just a DLL renamed(!)  And that seems to be it.  So if you compile your program into a DLL (with all the additional Boost::Python code) then you either change the extension or change the project settings for the output filename.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Tools for TortoiseSVN</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/06/tools-for-tortoisesvn.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-06T11:32:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-06:blog/2006/10/06/tools-for-tortoisesvn.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In order to make my TortoiseSVN as useful as possible, I use some external tools to maximise productivity.  It took a while to find the right set up but I am happy with it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For merging with a three-way diff when there are conflicks I found &lt;a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/"&gt;KDiff3&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to not be considered as sexy or well-known as most other tools.  But it does the job admirably with plenty of powerful features.  Certainly it does not look fully Windows-native, but that should not put you off if you want to use this powerful tool, and after all it is very rare that Subversion wants me to do a three-way diff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For standard diffs I use &lt;a href="http://winmerge.org/"&gt;WinMerge&lt;/a&gt;.  Simply it is the best Windows based diff and merge tool I have ever used.  It is powerful and intuitive, but is unfortunately limited to two-way diffs.  If it did do the three-way diffs I would not be using KDiff3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For viewing patch files (unified diffs) I use &lt;a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html"&gt;Notepad2&lt;/a&gt; which has nice highlighting, but it very rare that I will have a need to look at these patch files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing TortoiseSVN, install KDiff3 as it sets up your TortoiseSVN environment for you.  Then install WinMerge and choose &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;"WinMergeU.exe"&lt;/span&gt; as the diff viewer.  Then install Notepad2 and set it up as the unified diff viewer.  Doing it in this order means that you can let KDiff3's installation set up the bindings, and then configure the other ones by had as KDiff3's commandline isn't overly simple for TortoiseSVN.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>More Vista Native API</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/06/more-vista-native-api.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-06T07:37:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-06:blog/2006/10/06/more-vista-native-api.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Michael Dunn has posted anotehr Vista native API tutorial about &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/winfx/VGPowerMonitor.asp"&gt;monitoring the system's power&lt;/a&gt;.

I also wrote the support functions for cool looking disabled and hover (hot) looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total I think that was 250-300 icons.  Probably more.  I didn't follow any guidelines apart from my own consistency of design.  To be honest the Microsoft Guidelines were very difficult to follow if you wanted to produce a substantial number of toolbar and tree view icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few guidelines out there now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwxp/html/winxpicons.asp"&gt;Windows XP Icon Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/UxGuide/UXGuide/Resources/WhatsNewInVista/Aero.asp"&gt;Windows Vista Icon Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; - still not implemented.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGIcons/chapter_14_section_2.html"&gt;Apple OS X Icon Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I am writing this today is that Apple have recently added a style guide for their icons, and it is part of their &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGIntro/chapter_1_section_1.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000894-TP6"&gt;Apple Human Interface Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; which is essentially an online book and is very in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it interesting that OS makers can chastise the applications for not being consistent and so on, but without providing developers with the information and tools to go and do it, they surely can't be surprised...  Hell, you can't even edit 32-bit icons in Visual Studio or even through an add-on.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Visual Studio 2005 - Lets Break Everything!</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/04/visual-studio-2005-lets-break.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-04T20:05:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-04:blog/2006/10/04/visual-studio-2005-lets-break.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since I've been using Visual Studio.NET 2005 I have discovered a myriad of undocumented (or documented in such a way as to seem inoccuous) breaks in the compilation of most code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Standard C - the CRT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should start with the simplest and probably most common breaks that would effect you if you use C or C++ with the Visual C++ 8.0 (VC8) compiler.  If you have used swprintf or any of its relations you will find your code no longer compiles, or it does and gives an odd warning.  This is extremely dangerous as to make it more conforming they have added an extra parameter for the buffer size.  All well and good, but you find most of the code you download of the Internet no longer compiles. Simply adding &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;#define _CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; won't make a difference.  You need to add:&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;#define _CRT_NON_CONFORMING_SWPRINTFS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure this all gets added as the first thing in the &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;stdafx.h&lt;/span&gt; or in the pre-processor definitions in the project settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE&lt;/span&gt; will deal with the instances of other C runtime library code that has also changed.  This is because Microsoft have replaced all of the functions that you will get all the warnings about with "secure" functions.  This means that the function names are appended with &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;_s&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Floating Point Operations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three options now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;fp:fast&lt;/span&gt; - The fastest implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;fp:precise&lt;/span&gt; - slower but more "precise".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;fp:strict&lt;/span&gt; - the strictest implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;You have to make a choice - faster or more precise.  I still haven't discovered how imprecise &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;fp:fast&lt;/span&gt; is yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;C++ Standard Template Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll probably find that any code you use will fall over in some obscure and not so obscure instances, as well as being much slower.  And that goes double for Debug builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you need to add these to the top of your stdafx.h or your pre-processor definitions (or to your command line).  To get up and running use:&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;#define _SECURE_SCL 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;#define _SCL_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;#define _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;How to define these values.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The options to add these things:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add to your stdafx.h as plain preprocessor definitions.  This option seems to be the most hit-and-miss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add to your pre-processor definitions in your project settings.  This is done with semi-colon separated values, eg, &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;_SECURE_SCL=0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add it to your commandline.  Do this in the project settings commandline tab.  Add /D_SECURE_SL=0 for instance, you simply add /D then the preprocessor symbol without a space with an optional assignment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;In some instances one option may not work but one of the three will.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Windows Vista and its API</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/04/windows-vista-and-its-api.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-04T14:47:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-04:blog/2006/10/04/windows-vista-and-its-api.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After lots of uncertainty with Windows Vista as a developer (it's sad, I worry about such things), I breathed a huge sigh of relief today.  Windows Vista has generated such things as WPF and Aero and other things that mean very little to me as a developer.  Simply, I want to know how to access all the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This had me worried as they seem to want to make non-managed code a ghetto, but this is mainly from reading allt he public information and marketing.  It seems that the Win32 is still the basis of everything, although the name Win32 is ultimately misleading.  To cut to the chase, .NET sits on top of Win32, even in Vista, and you still have access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great little article on the &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/winfx/VGGlassIntro.asp"&gt;CodeProject&lt;/a&gt; that shows that you can write in what are now called the "Native APIs".  Hit the link and have a quick read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this exciting as a developer as this means that I can write my own wrappers for stuff and extend those wrappers I have written previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As promised it is time to integrate TortoiseSVN into Visual Studio 2005.  The easiest way I have found to do this is to post the vsettings files from Visual Studio once the environment is set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the zipped settings files:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/SubversionSettingsVS2005.zip"&gt;This link is for Visual Studio.NET 2005.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/SubversionSettingsVC2005Express.zip"&gt;This link is for Visual C++ 2005 Express.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to go to &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Tools-&amp;gt;Import and Export Settings&lt;/span&gt; and load the files from wizard dialog that pops up.  There are differences between the free Visual C++ Express and Visual Studio settings files, so please make sure you use the correct one.  It would also be an idea to say yes when the wizard asks you to back up your current settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one thing the settings get wrong on the build toolbar which is the size of some controls, so once the settings have loaded make sure you resize the items on the build toolbar by right-clicking and choosing &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Customise...&lt;/span&gt;.  Then you can select the items and make them smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settings have some of my own personal changes as well as the Subversion changes I am afraid, but you can choose which bits to load in on the settings wizard dialog.  There are some assumptions made also, the PlatformSDK is assumed to be in the default environment location under &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\PlatformSDK&lt;/span&gt;.  Also it assumes that TortoiseSVN is installed in the default directory.  The settings files are just XML so you could alter those directories by hand before loading it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have loaded these settings you will have:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Subversion Menu.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A consolidated help menu so the same number of menus is still there at the top.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Subversion toolbar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All Subversion options in menus and toolbars have icons associated with them that will look familiar to users of TortoiseSVN.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The context menu for Solutions has relevant Subversion options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As do individual files context menus - Diff, Log, Blame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since Subversion has its own menu they are no longer present in the External Tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Made the build bar actually have build options on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trimmed down the main file toolbar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All of the moving around of items means you get all the toolbars across the top of the screen in one row.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added quickwatch to the debug menu as it annoys me they removed it after Visual Studio 6.0.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Menu screenshot:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3420/3930/1600/SubversionMenu.png"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3420/3930/320/SubversionMenu.png" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Toolbar screenshot:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3420/3930/1600/SubversionToolbar.png"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3420/3930/320/SubversionToolbar.png" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Solution context menu:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3420/3930/1600/ContextSolution.png"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3420/3930/320/ContextSolution.png" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;File context menu:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3420/3930/1600/ContextFile.png"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3420/3930/320/ContextFile.png" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if anyone has any improvements let me know...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Subversion : TortoiseSVN Integration into Visual Studio.NET 2005 Again</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/03/subversion-tortoisesvn-integration_03.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-03T14:44:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-03:blog/2006/10/03/subversion-tortoisesvn-integration_03.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div class='post'&gt;
Today I discovered the "Import and Export Settings" feature in Visual Studio.NET 2005.  This means no more losing settings or having to mess around getting the environment set up again after a rogue installer blitzes all of the settings I had worked so hard to set up.

What this means is that later today I will post up a link to a file which will customise Visual Studio.NET 2003 for embedding TortoiseSVN.  You'll have icons, toolbars, new menus, and additions to the context menus.  You'll end up with some of my other settings like removing all Visual SourceSafe source control commands, and other things I find annoying.  But you will easily use this as a base setting and add your own bits and pieces to it.

&lt;p&gt;So I dug out the WRT54G and plugged it in.  It worked flawlessly until today when my two router network decided to eat itself.  Eventually after much resetting I got it all up and running again, but I discovered that with heavy network traffic like P2P (and probably my surfing habits) it can crash due to keeping a record of everything for five days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick websearch lead me to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRT54G"&gt;Wikipedia Article on the Linksys WRT54G&lt;/a&gt; and reading that I realised exactly what I had.  The company had opened up the firmware and there were a variety of open source versions available.  I then read this &lt;a href="http://www.utorrent.com/faq.php#Special_note_for_users_with_Linksys_WRT54G_GL_GS_routers"&gt;FAQ for utorrent&lt;/a&gt; where it describes what firmware it recommends and how to avoid overloading the router.  Never being afraid of destroying hardware I installed &lt;a href="http://www.thibor.co.uk/"&gt;HyperWRT Thibor&lt;/a&gt; on the router (there is a decent &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperWRT"&gt;Wikipedia page for HyperWRT&lt;/a&gt; as well).  Once it rebooted I saw how many extra features are in there now.  Needless to say I am buying only Linksys routers from now on...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Subversion : TortoiseSVN Integration into Visual Studio</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/02/subversion-tortoisesvn-integration.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-02T09:35:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-02:blog/2006/10/02/subversion-tortoisesvn-integration.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="/2007/07/tortoisesvn-and-visual-studio/"&gt;See the update here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the easy method of integrating &lt;a href="http://www.tortoisesvn.net"&gt;TortoiseSVN&lt;/a&gt; into Visual Studio.NET 2003 and 2005 (and probably Visual Studio 6.0).  I'll take it in stages first and show you how to add these useful things to your "External Tools" menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TortoiseSVN is kind enough to provide a decent command-line interface for bringing up the dialogs.  This gives us the ability to add External Tools that will operate on the currently open project in Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a script (vbs) that will append the External Tools to the end of your list:
&lt;table style="font-size:75%;border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; background-color: #f9f9f9;"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;'
' Create the Subversion External Tools for Visual Studio
'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;' Set the Visual Studio Version Number so we access the correct
' part of the registry for External Tools.
' Visual Studio.NET      = "7.0"
' Visual Studio.NET 2003 = "7.1"
' Visual Studio.NET 2005 = "8.0"
Dim strVisualStudioVersionNumber
strVisualStudioVersionNumber = "8.0"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dim strTortoiseSVNBin
strTortoiseSVNBin = "c:\program files\TortoiseSVN\bin\"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;' Create the scripting shell object
Dim WshShell

&lt;p&gt;You can set your Visual Studio version by setting the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;strVisualStudioVersionNumber&lt;/span&gt; variable according to the comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your TortoiseSVN is not in the default installation location change the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;strTortoiseSVNBin &lt;/span&gt;variable (making sure you use \ as separators).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a vbs expert but I tried to make this script as reusable as possible, especially with respect to writing the external tools to the registry.  This should work with any external tools you may want to add via this script.  There are probably some TortoiseSVN features that should be added as well, but I have got by on what is in that script so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next part I will describe how to make a toolbar to access the new External Tools.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Subversion and TortoiseSVN - A programmers best friend</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/01/subversion-and-tortoisesvn-programmers.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-01T18:29:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-01:blog/2006/10/01/subversion-and-tortoisesvn-programmers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Before you work in industry it is unlikely you ever use any source control.  At Essex Uni we were forced to use RCS (on the command-line) once and it all seemed pretty trivial and pointless.  Most of the time when you go into industry you end up having to use Visual SourceSafe, sure it does a job, but for the most part it is completely useless and scales terribly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I migrated the company I work at (&lt;a href="http://www.ncgraphics.net"&gt;NC Graphics&lt;/a&gt;) from Visual SourceSafe to Subversion.  I prepared a lot for this doing tons of research to make this transition as seamless as humanly possible, but as these things normally happen time was a serious factor.  Bizarrely it was done ahead of schedule and the benefits were pretty much instantaneous.  Sometimes in IT we beat deadlines(!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Migration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent ages reading everything I could find via Google about migrating anything to Subversion.  This was necessary as there was very little covering Visual SourceSafe specifically.  In the end I had to choose the only tool even remotely capable of doing the conversion called &lt;a href="http://vss2svn.tigris.org/"&gt;vss2svn&lt;/a&gt; and even then there were some compromises that had to be made.  I used the orginal "legacy" script from their development repository.  It essentially gets every file you have currently in your source tree and then search each of their histories backwards in time.  This does mean you lose renames and files that have been removed.  The good thing though is that it converts the check-ins into Subversion style atomic commits by grouping them all together by time and user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a new version of &lt;a href="http://www.pumacode.org/projects/vss2svn"&gt;vss2svn&lt;/a&gt; (new website) but it was nowhere near being ready when I was doing this work.  This version actually reconstructs almost everything by reverse-engineering the Visual SourceSafe file format.  If you have archived portions or restored portions I found that it didn't work.  It seems to have come a long way since I last looked, but I don't think it would have converted our large database with all of its quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the original script though...  To get it to run fast what I did was archive out the areas of SourceSafe we needed and then imported them into a brand new clean instance.  This cut the running time for the script from the test run of 14 days down to less than 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Using Subversion For Development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously you have the basic command-line tools for using &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; but there is a lot more out there as well.  Internally we use &lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/"&gt;TortoiseSVN&lt;/a&gt; and that is about it.  Most people are looking at loads of other options, but once you use TortoiseSVN you don't need anything else, it only takes about a day, maybe two to realise this.  Without hyperbole I can say TortoiseSVN ranks right up there as one of the greatest gifts to developers ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it even more useful though I did a little work to integrate it into Visual Studio.NET (2003 and 2005).  It is actually really simple to do because TortoiseSVN provides us with a commandline interface that can display the dialogs.  In the next couple of days I will give complete instructions how to set this up and even describe how to set it all up on a toolbar like I currently have it.  I'll also cover all the clients I checked out in the course of the migration.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>First Post</title><link href="http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2006/10/01/first-post.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-10-01T15:52:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Garry Bodsworth</name></author><id>tag:www.fragmentedmemory.com,2006-10-01:blog/2006/10/01/first-post.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I suppose at the moment I just need an outlet for all these computer-type things going round in my head.  I mainly specialise in C++ and was once known (and probably still known) as a GUI specialist.  I've done all kinds of random things like setting up a company-wide bug database and migrating a Visual SourceSafe (VSS) "database" to a Subversion repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to read loads of programming stuff in my spare time and I think should put my money where my mouth is and provide some source code on the Internet that may be of use to someone.  On numerous occasions in my programming career I have encountered bits and pieces that even Google couldn't rescue me from, and I know for a fact MSDN help is a chocolate teapot.  I like it when the building blocks are out there and it gives you just enough to build your own solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the future if you are interested, you can look forward to ramblings on C++, Open Source libraries that I encounter, MFC, Win32, user interface design, Open Source programs that make life easier, STL library, Boost library, template metaprogramming, code design, Python, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
