So Windows Vista was released on MSDN Subscriber Downloads today.  I offered to be the Vista guinea pig and install it to make sure everything works before it hits general release.<br /><br />Two identical computers one I spent all afternoon trying to get to work which could only amount to 4-bit colour 640x480&#8230;  I tried swapping graphics cards - no luck.  The other identical twin computer, pop the disc in and bosh it is installed and looking all Aero-ey.  Even swapping the graphics cards between the two computers seems not to have helped.  This is a bizarre turn of events, especially as XP seems to have run and installed no problem.  It was not a driver problem either since it seems to have installed and understands the cards, but it seems to be an IRQ conflict of some sort, I haven&#8217;t seen one of them since the old DOS days :D<br /><br />Also, you still have to use an external source for your RAID drivers.  I was hoping that was not still the case.  Hopefully, it will all be solved by a clear head on Monday.</div>

The <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org">Enlightenment</a> project has been a cutting edge desktop environment for many years.  Although it is not seen as cutting edge any more due mainly to 3D accelerated eye candy, it is still very powerful and interesting, also it is really very efficient.<br /><br />Currently the entire product is in heavy development but it is relatively stable (see <a href="http://www.elivecd.org/">eLive to try it out with a Live CD</a>).  The system is designed around a series of libraries some of which are more complete than others.  Recently it was also revealed that <a href="http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/">Yellow Dog Linux</a> was putting together a Linux for PS3 and it was <a href="http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/news/2006/2006-10-17.shtml">using Enlightenment as the default desktop manager</a>.  This also will help provide funding for the project.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the point of this post&#8230;  A series of tutorials have just become available for the <a href="http://wiki.edevelop.org/index.php/EWL">Enlightened Widget Library (EWL)</a> portion of Enlightenment.  This provides the widget toolkit for the environment.  These are introductory tutorials and can be seen here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.edevelop.org/index.php/EWL_Introduction">Part 1</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.edevelop.org/index.php/EWL_Introduction_II">Part 2</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.edevelop.org/index.php/EWL_Introduction_III">Part 3</a><br /><br />The main development community can be accessed <a href="http://www.edevelop.org/">here</a>.  The way that Enlightenment has been put together shows obvious care and thought, after all you don&#8217;t have to necessarily have the full desktop environment to use just some of the libraries.</div>

On my Internet travels I walk randomly through following links until I find something interesting.  That is what I have done:<br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/11/10/the-office-2007-ui-bible.aspx">The Office 2007 UI Bible</a><br /><br />This is a series of many blog posts that look into the reasoning behind the new Office 2007 UI.  It covers the history of office GUIs, the new design, and how to extend that design.  There are lots of interesting points but it will take a long while to get through!</div>

<blockquote>F3 is actually a declarative Java scripting language with static typing for good IDE support and compile-time error reporting (unlike JavaScript&#8230;), type-inference, declarative syntax, and automatic data-binding with full support for 2d graphics and standard Swing components as well as declarative animation. You can also import java classes, create new Java objects, call their methods, and implement Java interfaces.</blockquote>The blog of the lead developer is available <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/chrisoliver/category/F3">here</a>.  This looks like another interesting Java project, which is developed by Sun, so it will be open-sourced very soon.<br /><br />There are lots of demos available on the blog, so you can see the work first-hand.  It kind of reminds me of <a href="http://www.torjo.com/win32gui/">Win32GUI Generics</a>.  It looks pretty interesting and something new for Java, so it would be something to keep an eye on.</div>

It&#8217;s only a couple of days since the news that Java is going GPL.  The kind of initial flurry has died down but the substance is starting to come along.<br /><br />The <a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/">OpenJDK</a> project is off and running.  There are two parts - the <a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/compiler/">Java Compiler</a> and the <a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/hotspot/">Java Hotspot VM</a>.<br /><br />The <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish Project</a> is for the goal of building open-source, production quality, enterprise software.  This project is already a year old.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve downloaded some of the code already to take a look at it.  It&#8217;s quite nicely written and as such is pretty understandable for such a complex project.</div>

You can&#8217;t have escaped this platform, you might not have heard about it, but it provides the basis for <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>, <a href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Democracy Player</a>, and <a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/">SongBird</a> (which I mentioned <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/digital-music-songbird.html">before</a> and it&#8217;s continuing apace).  A good place to start is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XULRunner">Wikipedia article on XULRunner</a>, it provides the links you need to get started.<br /><br />XULRunner is not simply a user interface but probably could be described as a platform like Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Application_Markup_Language">XAML/.NET</a> or like <a href="http://www.java.net/">Java&#8217;s virtual machine</a> (very loosely) or <a href="http://dev.aol.com/boxely/">Boxely from AOL</a>.  Essentially it provides a layer of abstraction from the underlying architecture in order to allow the developer to work on the actual coding.  XULRunner is the framework to allow standalone applications to be developed using the XUL language used for Firefox extensions.<br /><br />Currently <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner">XULRunner</a> is in beta with version 1.8, but with version 1.9 next year they recommend that for production releases.  Along with the 1.9 release the Gecko rendering engine is also getting updated with some additional nice vector rendering.<br /><br />The framework provides a myriad of features.  There is built-in spell-checking, networking, the aforementioned Gecko engine, web services, storage/SQLie interfaces, UI, the ability to embed in another application, and also the Python bindings (full version forthcoming).  I think the reason that I find this quite interesting is the two applications I have used most at home and work in the past couple of years have been based on this.  I just wonder how far it can all be pushed for heavyweight desktop application development.<br /><br />You can view a list of applications based on XULRunner <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner_Hall_of_Fame">here</a>.  When the final proper release of 1.9 is out I imagine there will be more people willing to use it as it won&#8217;t be all belt and braces, there can be solid tutorials and the suchlike.<br /><br />With so many of these types of projects around at the moment, I am wondering when the &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; will start to kick in.  Admittedly, XULRunner has a very strong chance since it is a platform for Thunderbird and Firefox.</div>

I&#8217;m sitting here wondering if there is anything out there to use vector based graphics to render some icons or toolbars.  I&#8217;ve been Googling for something like that out of curiosity - and I seem to have come up dry.<br /><br />The only one I have found that seems to do what I am expecting is the <a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/">Juce Library</a>.  In fact in most libraries creating and maintaining toolbars and icons is pretty laborious (especially in MFC), so you tend to write your own wrappers for functionality.  Myself, I have written code to automatically generate hot and disabled image lists in MFC so only one bitmap needs to be edited (I have also written this code more than once - problems of proprietary code).<br /><br />I know there is talk that Vista wants everyone to use vector icons (which is a problem for all those people who currently use bitmaps), but there seems to be very little information out there about it.<br /><br />I realise most people try to write fully featured GUI toolkits, but there must be smaller implementations of specialised functionality out there?  Kind of like common building blocks?  I suppose one would be a rendering engine using system theming, another being resource management, another rendering those resources&#8230;</div>

Here are a couple more articles to do with the open-sourcing of Java with a bit more substance.  One from <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2006/11/open-source-java">InfoQ</a> and another from <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2055770,00.asp">eWeek</a>.<br /><br />But that isn&#8217;t what this post is about.  I&#8217;ve discovered an XP look and feel style for Java called <a href="https://winlaf.dev.java.net/">WinLAF</a> as it was felt the native look was not sufficient.  Reading about Java 6.0 though suggests that a big leap forward for native Windows look and feel is being made for this version called Mustang, also taking into account Windows Vista.<br /><br />There are a myriad of enhancements for the new version of Java here including lots of alterations for Swing <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/javase6/">here</a>.  It links to all the related bug/enhancement reports.  An outline from <a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2006/09/22/jse_bling/">The Register is also available</a>.  The new rendering engine uses the Windows UxTheme DLL.<br /><br />There is an article with plenty of <a href="http://www.ffnn.nl/pages/articles/java/java-2-se-6.0-aesthetics-preview.php">screenshots of Java 6.0 aesthetics</a>.</div>

After a few weeks/months of build up the <a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS3337915997.html">the press are now reporting on Sun open-sourcing Java under the GPL license</a>.  This is free as in freedom.  This is great news, especially in the <a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_to_Pay_Novell_348_Million/1162966311">current climate brought about by Microsoft in recent weeks</a> (with the <a href="http://news.samba.org/announcements/team_to_novell/">Samba team now pubic in their opposition to the deal</a>).  Overall, this is great news and I imagine this could push Java from strength to strength.  Pair this up with the <a href="http://www.kaourantin.net/2006/11/spidermonkeys-relative-tamarin-joins.html">Adobe&#8217;s EMCAScript donation to the Mozilla Foundation</a>, I think this could be a very exciting time for the Java family of products.<br /><br />This has also got me thinking about Java user interfaces.  The last time I looked at them many years ago they were more of a Motif style of user-interface, certainly not the native look&#8217;n&#8217;feel.  I wondered how far they have got now.  I am a user of <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a> the fantastic BitTorrent client written in Java, the interface is not quite native, but has been getting closer and closer in each subsequent version.  Apparently it is also possible to build Azureus with the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">GNU Classpath library</a> supplied with the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>.<br /><br />There is some documentation about Swing look&#8217;n&#8217;feel available <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-mer05273/">here</a> about some default theming.  There is also a look&#8217;n&#8217;feel Java website <a href="http://javootoo.l2fprod.com/">here</a>.  There certainly seems to be a lot out there that runs pretty close to being native looking, but it seems to fall short in some places, I think this warrants some more investigation&#8230;</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">UPDATED</span><br /><br />Damn, I wake up this morning and switch on the computer to discover that AVG are discontinuing the <a href="http://free.grisoft.com/">free edition of their anti-virus suite</a> as of January 2007.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">START UPDATE</span><br />Well, the message as it turns out was a bit misleading.  They are discontinuing 7.1 free edition and are advising the users to update to 7.5 which is still free.  Click the link in the first paragraph to download - incidentally it uses <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> for its user interface.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">END UPDATE</span><br /><br />It has been a fairly decent product, especially for the price, and has meant that I don&#8217;t have to install one of the myriad of Norton Security packages that I own (normally given away free with computer parts).  I suppose I could go and install those, but I am not really pleased with the software when I have used it.  Mainly due to <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> AVG Free Edition has only spotted one virus attempting to get on my PC in the past few years - and this is definitely not from being a poor anti-virus.<br /><br />Anyway here is a list of free alternatives for all of you in the same position:<br /><ul><li>It seems <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html">Avast</a> is the most fully featured and professional program you could choose.</li><li><a href="http://www.free-av.com/">Avira AntiVir</a> is also a well respected free anti-virus alternative.</li><li>And now an open-source alternative:</li><li><a href="http://www.clamwin.com/">Clamwin</a> - A free open-source anti-virus engine.

hi, came across your blog while Googling. i don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re discontinuing the free antivirus <em>per se</em>, just the 7.1 version of the free antivirus. users are advised to upgrade to 7.5, that&#8217;s all.<br />as you said, i&#8217;ve had some experience with AVG and i think it&#8217;s really good. it traps quite a number of the bugs that circulate, including a number that infect via autorun, which is a rather large issue where i am at the moment.</div>
