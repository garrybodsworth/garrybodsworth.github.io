<div class="post-content"><p>There is a new <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> tool out there for the Mac called <a href="http://github.com/pieter/gitx/wikis">GitX</a>. It is a history viewer with a nice looking Aqua interface which makes a welcome change from the look of Gitk. It probably doesn&#8217;t quite reach <a href="http://digilander.libero.it/mcostalba/">qgit</a> but that website has been very quiet for quite a while.</p>

<p>GitX has the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show pretty information for any revision</li>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Nice Aqua interface</li>
<li>Quickly search for any commit subject / author</li>
<li>Explore tree of any revision</li>
<li>QuickLook any file in any revision</li>
<li>Double click any file or directory in a tree to open that version</li>
<li>Auto-updates</li>
</ul>


<p>I hope that there is at least one fully featured UI for Git eventually that compares to TortoiseSVN because it will make my life a lot easier. This looks like a very string start for the Mac though, although there are loads of UIs out there being developed, but they all normally use different ways of building their own porcelains.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Python 2.6 is <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6/">available now</a> from the Python website. You can see the what&#8217;s new <a href="http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.6.html">here</a>. This is going to make <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> much more complicated&#8230;</p>

<p>The most obvious addition is the support for the version 3.0 support. There is a -3 switch to check for future incompatibilities as well as all the new features and syntax. It seems to essentially provide the 3.0 features without breaking backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>The new look of the documentation is easy on the eyes and it all helps make it much easier to navigate. Documentation is normally an unloved part of most projects, but they have done a really good job <a href="http://docs.python.org/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>with</strong> statement has been added which means you can now write context managers. These things seem to simulate enforced scoping (like you would have in things like C++). Additionally there are some new packages including multiprocessing, fractions, JSON, and a propertylist parser. Obviously multiprocessing has been in the news recently thanks to the Google Chrome browser, and this will simplify other people trying to go the same route (I&#8217;d only recommend doing it on making sure your platform/OS allows for quick process creation if you are using lots of them). Obviously the JSON support will be handy for web developers and should simplify some web frameworks.</p>

<p>There is tons more in there &#8211; probably more than any sane person would ever learn, but it does help Python get stronger because we will all use different portions of the language.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>A while back I used to do a lot of illustration, and I just realised that hardly any of it is out there on the Internet any more. So I&#8217;ll be posting some of it interspersed with my usual developer ramblings.</p>

<p>This post is for an illustration that ended up on the back cover of <strong>Transformers: Alignment Volume 1</strong> which was a special story bookending the Transformers comics mythos written by Simon Furman. This magazine was designed by <a href="http://www.the-hub.co.uk">Graham Thomson</a> and was an exclusive for <a href="http://www.transforce.org.uk/">Transforce 2001 run by Paul Cannon</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve put up two versions &#8211; one has a simplified background which I think looks much less cluttered, but the WarWorlds you can see flying through space are part of the story. I&#8217;ll scan in the original black and white image as well to show some of the process in the colouring when I can find an A3 scanner. The images on Flickr are 1600&#215;1200.</p>

<p>The image was inspired by this passage in the original treatment by Simon Furman:</p>

<blockquote><p>Cybertron, three hundred years after Unicron:</p>

<p>Much has changed.</p>

<p>Led by the insane warlord GALVATRON, the Decepticons have built and mobilised a vast fleet of Warworlds; moon-sized ships with awesome destructive firepower. In order to safeguard Cybertron, the Autobots have relocated their world, using technology appropriated from former Decepticon general Jhiaxus to clone other ‘Cybertrons’ from barren, uninhabited (non-metal) worlds. These decoys serve both to mislead and divide the enemy, but new intelligence has led the Decepticon fleet tantalisingly close to the location of the real Cybertron. A massed Autobot armada engages the Decepticons at Pinea Omicron in an attempt to end the conflict once and for all. Huge losses are sustained by both sides, and OPTIMUS PRIME finally destroys Galvatron… but at considerable cost to himself. Severely wounded, his power reserves decimated, he hovers at death’s door and the Autobots place him in protective stasis.</p></blockquote>

<div class="post-content"><p>Sometimes you look at where you are now and think &#8220;How did I get here?&#8221;, currently it is in a good way but certainly in difficult times you think &#8220;How the hell did I get here?&#8221;. Certainly thinking back to when I started working as a developer I would never have predicted I&#8217;d be doing what I am now.</p>

<p>Back in 2000 I started out as a C++ developer on Windows for user interface work. The user interface was MFC which will strike fear into the hearts of some programmers, and the source control system was Visual SourceSafe (bear in mind the initial release of Subversion was around the same date I started). This was the initial baptism in commercial realities of development and my first interaction with real talented developers who actually got software out of the door.</p>

<p>In 2002 I experienced my first takeover. My job description didn&#8217;t really change although I wasn&#8217;t a graduate any more. The type of development work I was doing was moving out of the original GUI type work into a more generalised area. Even at one point I ended up deploying a bug database company-wide running a custom version of Bugzilla, which was equal parts interesting and a complete nightmare.</p>

<p>In 2005 I went back to my original company, and this was where my development career started to get much more interesting. During that time I worked on the building blocks of the system and dipped into areas that would not have been seen as my comfort area like the serious heavy maths. I ended up trying to learn more and push myself, after all people out there have solved the same problems, so I joined <a href="http://bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">SPA Cambridge</a> and <a href="http://accu.org">ACCU</a>. During this period at work I moved the company over to Subversion, re-vamped the build system and installer, and got the 64-bit release done.</p>

<p>After another takeover I decided it was time to move on again, and to hopefully continue learning. Unfortunately this move didn&#8217;t work out, although I did pick up a couple of things during that time, and learnt a bit about what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>This leads me to my current job at <a href="http://www.camvine.com">Camvine</a> where I am learning lots of new stuff. This means I am having a huge amount of fun. Also, because it is a start-up, the company is of a size and mentality that makes me feel at home. In the space of about ten weeks(ish) I&#8217;ve had to learn Python, new technologies, lots about networking, and (finally) lead an almost Microsoft free lifestyle.</p>

<p>So, since starting my professional career in October 2000, in (almost) October 2008 I am getting to do work I suppose I would have dreamed of if I knew it was what I wanted to do. I think it shows that your career can evolve into unexpected and exciting areas.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com">AppleInsider</a> have put up a very interseting article about iTunes and accessibility:<br/>
<a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/09/27/apple_makes_itunes_8_itunes_u_content_accessible_to_the_blind.html">Apple makes iTunes 8, iTunes U content accessible to the blind</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Apple has volunteered to work with the state of Massachusetts to make iTunes 8 and the new iPod nano fully accessible, unlocking music, movies, and the free lectures and other educational material in iTunes U to blind users.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is fantastic news as accessibility online is extremely important, especially as there is a move away from physical products in certain industries. With the iPod Nano 4G they have added more options with large fonts access and a spoken interface. Pairing that up with a more accessible iTunes will make it the best digital delivery platform for the visually impaired, especially since most other fully targeted solutions look like hell and are normally a few generations of technology behind.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>So I was having a bit of an unhappy time attempting to get GTK+ to compile successfully. My determination has finally paid off and I got it to work.</p>

<p>As it turns out I built Glib and GTK+ from their respective trunks so I could guarantee they were in sync. But what I was trying to achieve was to use a Git master tracking branch and I finally discovered my own ineptitude:</p>

<p><code>git pull . master</code></p>

<p>It is your friend and pulls the changes from the master and applies them to your branch. I then tried to compile it and it worked! So I now have a compiled version of <a href="http://nanosleep.org/wiki/GTK%2B_Indirect_Renderer">GTK+ that can run on a headless server</a> with absolutely no X server dependencies. Now I just need to experiment with the library.</p>

<p>I wrote down all the notes on how to compile your own GTK+ so I will post those online in the hope I will save someone else losing their hair.</p>
