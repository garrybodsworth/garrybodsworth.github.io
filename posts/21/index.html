<div class="post-content"><p>I stumbled across <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iui/">iUI</a> this weekend. It provides a UI for developing iPhone applications that run in MobileSafari that look the same as native iPhone applications.</p>

<p>It provides the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create Navigational Menus and iPhone interfaces from standard HTML.</li>
<li>Use or knowledge of JavaScript is not required to create basic iPhone pages.</li>
<li>Ability to handle phone orientation changes.</li>
<li>Provide a more &#8220;iPhone-like&#8221; experience to Web apps (on or off the iPhone).</li>
</ul>


<p>There is a great introduction blog post from Hoe Hewitt <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/introducing_iui.php">here</a>. The library provides all the building blocks to get started quickly with some spiffing looking iPhone specific webpages.</p>

<p>On the project page there is a couple of examples including a <a href="http://iui.googlecode.com/svn/tags/REL-current/samples/digg/index.html#___1__">Digg Interface</a> and a <a href="http://iui.googlecode.com/svn/tags/REL-current/samples/music.html#_home">music UI sample</a>.</p>

<p>On a related note there is an interesting post on iPhone browser performance <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/07/webkit_performance_iphone">here</a>.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>On Monday I start my new job at <a href="http://www.camvine.com">Camvine</a>, so I thought I&#8217;d take the opportunity to do some shameless promotion for the company.</p>

<p>The company is about delivering digital information to network connected displays with the flagship product being <a href="http://camvine.com/products/coda">CODA</a>. You have CODAlinks which allows you to connect a display to the network. You have the CODAbox which sends data to lots of CODAlinks and lives on the local network. The final piece is the CODA website where you configure the content you want on the screens.</p>

<p>The advantages of this system is that it is better value than similar systems, and you can expand easily with additional CODAlinks. One major feature is that it is nowhere near as power hungry as equivalent systems which is always a good thing. It is simple to set-up, manage and maintain.</p>

<p>And if anyone knows a good <a href="http://camvine.com/opportunities/smdir1">Marketing &amp; Sales Director</a>, there is a vacancy going&#8230;</p>

<time datetime="2008-07-18T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true"></time>
</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>Over the past six months I have actually got to use some tablet PCs, and I wonder why any company pursues that market unless it is seriously high margins. For a start the power of these computers are some way off the cutting edge both by processor and graphically. Also the build quality is not good with cheap flimsy plastic made to feel even more unstable thanks to a swivelling monitor so it can be a normal laptop as well.</p>

<p>What really gets me about tablet PCs is the software. I have tried both Windows XP Tablet PC Edition and Windows Vista which has integrated the functionality into the core system (I guess for certain levels of Vista). Additional functionality is provided by the driver software in order to make it easier to use. This is my main gripe, the entire GUI system is predicated around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)">WIMP</a> and specifically the way that has been set in stone by Windows. The problem is that the pen then becomes basically a pressure sensitive mouse which makes it more difficult and more work to do basic things like resize windows or the horrific right-click if there is a button on the pen. In addition there is normally a trackpad or mouse pointer mechanism built into the computer because it has not fully embraced the tablet way of doing things.</p>

<p>The drivers that the hardware suppliers give try to get around problems like multiple selection (in this instance there is a tick box next to every item in Explorer), and try to make it a bit easier. Unfortunately, because this is not integrated with the core system it is not perfect and needs to deal with unexpected system changes, say for instance plugging in an external display.</p>

<p>The tablet PCs do thrive in environments with a very focussed use where a custom UI is constructed that provides the correct interaction mechanisms.</p>

<p>I read this article <a href="http://uk.gizmodo.com/2008/07/18/the_mouse_is_for_the_scrapheap.html">The Mouse Is For The Scrapheap</a> this morning and thought they are a bit hopeful. They are really talking about other interaction mechanisms for specific tasks, not for general computing. This is entirely down to the GUI provided in the operating system, it is not designed for any other way of interacting. Microsoft want <a href="http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2008/05/27/microsoft-demonstrates-multi-touch.aspx">multi-touch at the centre of Windows 7</a>, but unless the user interface changes substantially it will be a half-hearted solution. The demonstrations centred around demonstration applications that could use it rather than the framework for the entire GUI.</p>

<p>How would the problem be solved? You would start with the multi-touch implementation and a blank screen. Then create a window that allows for the interactions user&#8217;s expect such as resizing, moving, minimising, etc. This would have to work for the hand driven multitouch in a quick and painless fashion because current window implementations would be too fiddly, but you may find some common ground that can be used in the prototype.</p>

<p>Luckily Apple had a chance for a clean break with the iPhone/iTouch and designed the user interface in a pared down fashion that works for even my fat fingers. This was done by working on a Cocoa Touch API where it is the basis of the interactions the user has, and the main system applications provide a roadmap for the GUI design.</p>

I love the original graphic novel, it is an example of comics doing what other mediums cannot. The story is merely incidental when compared to the craft and knowledge of the comic book page.

<div class="post-content"><p>My way of surfing the Internet up until last week was to go through the links in my bookmarks (hosted on <a href="http://del.icio.us/">delicious</a>) and see if there was anything I wanted to read. It&#8217;s a very long-winded approach to surfing the Internet that requires knowing what was there before and aso visting sites that have no updates.</p>

<p>On this blog I made sure I had an RSS feed, but rarely used them myself apart from tracking bug reporting system issues and wiki changes&#8230;</p>

<p>Last week I decided to set up <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> with the websites I usually frequent. From that I have discovered there are about 600 articles per day out there that I might possibly be interested in. Now I can keep track of what I have and haven&#8217;t read, but now I need to remember to bookmark the interesting articles.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s bizarre that I have been using the Internet since 1995-ish, and this is now a fundamental change to the way I use it. I suppose this is part of the content aggregation that now defines services on the Internet.</p>

    </h1>
  
  








  


<time datetime="2008-07-16T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true"></time>
</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>I sometimes think its old age or something but I think modern console controllers are completely useless. I played Grand Theft Auto 4 on the X-Box 360 and realised the controller was useless, you had shoulder buttons, shoulder analogue buttons, a direction pad, plenty of buttons, an analogue stick, and buttons in the centre. They are also all laid out for people whose hands and fingers are a certain size. The PS3 is just as guilty with loads of controls and not much design progression from previous generations, I really struggled with first person shooters.</p>

<p>The problem really is that these controllers are trying to solve all eventualities and not sticking to the &#8220;less is more&#8221; convention. When you are what is defined as a hardcore gamer you are used to it and can&#8217;t understand why anyone can&#8217;t pick these controllers up and use them easily. Also games try to use every button because they are there.</p>

<p>The way I see it in the future is that most games will come with their own controllers. This has a two fold effect, firstly the controller represents the way that you want the user to interact with the game and clearly defines the user experience. Secondly, the controller becomes part of the package you are buying, so you are not getting just software which is a way of rhaving an incentive to actually buy the package.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Wii gets so much of this right. The controllers are simple and intuitive and encourage &#8220;casual&#8221; play because you don&#8217;t have to re-wire your brain for a quick play. Also the controllers are multi-paradigm with more than one component, you can use it as a SNES-like controller, you can use an analogue stick, you can use the accelerometers. The other part of this is that the controllers &#8220;dock&#8221;, for instance Mario Kart has a steering wheel you put the Wii controller inside, as does Guitar Her and its ilk. This also dramatically reduces the cost of manufacturing a custom controller.</p>

<p>My favourite controller is <a href="http://www.xgaming.com/">this</a> though&#8230;</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I only started using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> last week and I have been completely in awe of its features and how much it is a step forward from Blogger.</p>

<p>Now a week later my Dashboard is informing me WordPress 2.6 is out and did I want to upgrade. The new features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Post revisions &#8211; so you can get wiki-like tracking of changes.</li>
<li>Press This! &#8211; So you can blog from anywhere on the web and do instant embedding of Flickr and YouTube content.</li>
<li>Gears &#8211; It now makes use of Google&#8217;s Gears to help speed up via caching.</li>
<li>Theme previews &#8211; You can try out themes before they are publicly seen on your site.</li>
<li>Word count &#8211; for those who want endless statistics.</li>
<li>Image captions.</li>
<li>Improvements to plug-in management.</li>
</ul>


<p>I used the <a href="http://www.zirona.com/software/wordpress-instant-upgrade/">instant upgrade plug-in</a> for WordPress, and it was painless and fast. It is really easy to upgrade now which is fantastic when you are managing your own website.</p>
