An interesting article came up on <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk">The Register</a> about the Adobe development process.  It covers the approach applied for Adobe CS3 and how it was successful.  Really it was an application of iterative development.  You can read the article <a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2007/03/08/adobe_cs3_development/">here</a>.</div>

There is an article <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000688.html">here</a> about how Vista handles system memory.  It is called &#8220;Why does Vista use all my memory&#8221; by Jeff Atwood.<br /><br />Essentially all system memory is now considered a cache (using a system called SuperFetch).  This means that the amount of memory used would be as much RAM as is available to cache from the hard-drive.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t know if I am completely sure it is a good idea because if a program requires a lot of memory then it has the initial lag to clear the cache in order to service memory requests.  Maybe as time goes on the technology will get better, so it may be more usable in the future.</div>

Since going back to standard XP Pro I thought is there a way of making it look a bit more modern.  I didn&#8217;t fancy messing round with the theming DLLs and using what essentially amount to substandard themes.<br /><br />I thought how about getting the MCE2005 UI on Windows XP Pro (not a recreation of it but the actual one).  A few minutes Googling gave me my answer, Microsoft New Zealand had accidentally released the Royale theme, unfortunately they pulled it soon after.  Luckily this being the Internet the cat can never go back in the bag.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-Enhancements/Themes/Royale-Theme-for-WinXP.shtml">MCE2005 Royale theme</a> for Windows XP is available at the link.  You just need to run the installer and it puts it in the right place.<br /><br />For those that like things a bit darker there is a Royale Noir theme leaked from Microsoft that did not make the cut into MCE2005.  You can download the files <a href="http://plaza.ufl.edu/psrivats/Luna2.rar">here</a>.  You need to install this after the Royale theme.  Extract it to c:\WINDOWS\Resource\Luna Noir.  Then double-click on the luna.msstyles file, this will then give another sub-option to Royale on the Appearance tab in display settings.</div>

Finally today I snapped.<br /><br />No more Vista for me I am going back to Windows XP and hopefully a working life of sanity.  I had been at work for two hours and accomplished nothing but fighting with Windows Vista for uninstalling, installing, and rebooting.  Even then I didn&#8217;t manage to finish what I was trying to do.<br /><br />So then I snapped.  I decided to go back to Windows XP.  No more deathly slow animations or silent marches of death through the UAC for me.  I have no idea if Vista is a good consumer OS, but it is awful for developers who have to constantly install, reboot, update, use large amounts of files, do incremental building, and other such things.<br /><br />I can&#8217;t see a service pack rectifying the problem, maybe in three years it will be usable if the XP lifecycle is anything to go by.<br /><br />It was noticeable working on Vista then coming home to XP simply how much faster XP is.  It is not anything to do with slowness drawing to the screen or the length of animations.  It all comes down to things like context menus, and security running in the background that makes simple tasks like starting a program or switching applications into a waiting game.  Nothing ever &#8220;locks up&#8221; as something is always moving and interactive, but it rarely lets you do a series of quickfire operations or run multiple IDEs without groaning.  Don&#8217;t even get me started on rebooting breaking C++ precompiled headers.<br /><br />Well, this three month hell is over&#8230;</div>

I had to make sure the application I work on runs well on Vista.  It was the best way to ensure this.<BR/><BR/>Unfortunately I paid the price with my own sanity.  People are already commenting I am much more relaxed running XP ;)</div>

Three months? I&#8217;m impressed.<BR/>I lasted four or five days before I gave up and went back to XP&#8230;<BR/>It&#8217;s interesting to see I&#8217;m not alone though&#8230; ;)</div>

The desktop compositing situation in Linux is moving pretty fast.  Compiz is the base, but Beryl, a branch of Compiz, is the one getting a lot of coverage mainly due to its speed of development.<br /><br />There is an <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=17296">update about Compiz/Beryl from xdevconf07</a> about their relationship.<br /><br />Additionally there is a variety of articles about some <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=17305">additional usability features</a> in Beryl.</div>

Google have announced <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/02/speaking-of-summer.html">Summer Of Code 2007</a>.<br /><br />Last year it helped projects get more functionality and encouraged more people to get involved with open-source projects.  They will start taking applications in March, and providing the successful applicants apply themselves well (many find they have to drop out or they are unable to commit anything) there should be a lot of good stuff from it.<br /><br />You can check out more information <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">here</a>.</div>

Whilst scouring the <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/">Adobe ASL</a> website (which contains an open-source GUI toolkit) I encountered a few interesting links and tidbits of information.  The ASL is written in C++ utilising sections of Boost (part of which now includes Adobe&#8217;s on GIL library) and the most hardcore of generic programming techniques.<br /><br />The most interesting thing I came across was from Alexander Stepanov, the father of the STL, and writer of books about advanced template programming.  <a href="http://www.stepanovpapers.com/notes.pdf">Alexander Stepanov&#8217;s Notes</a> is a substantial PDF file (more of a book really) that collates and updates his notes from various lectures including those at Adobe and SGI.  It is not entirely about C++ as such, it is just the example language used is C++.<br /><br />This also lead me to find the <a href="http://www.stepanovpapers.com/">Stepanov Papers website</a> which provides a resource for reading his wide selection of papers.<br /><br />And for a bit more background on Generic programming check out these overviews <a href="http://www.boost.org/more/generic_programming.html">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming">here</a>.</div>

<a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/programming/">Win32++</a> is a GUI toolkit just for Windows.  It is a C++ toolkit providing abstraction from the base Win32 functionality, kind of like MFC, but written much better and more clearly.<br /><br />It is a small toolkit that is a thin wrapper around the Win32 API.  It is not a drop-in replacement for anything else, but provides a simplified programming platform for beginners and intermediate programmers.<br /><br />It provides facilities for MDI, rebars, toolbars, critical sections and more.  I suppose it must be relatively easy to expand the number of classes if you have greater requirements.  The advantage of this toolkit is that unlike MFC it works with the free compilers as MFC is only supplied with the professional versions of Visual Studio.  Customisation of existing classes is suggested via subclassing, which is the simplest conceptual way of adding functionality in C++.  With these classes you will not run into the problems with virtual destructors and the cobject derived class issues.<br /><br />There are a variety of examples including a notepad program, some DirectX, some multithreading, and more.<br /><br />The creator of this toolkit has written an article <a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/programming/explanation.htm">Why Beginners Shouldn&#8217;t use MFC</a>.</div>
