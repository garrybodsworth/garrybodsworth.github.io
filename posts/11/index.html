<div class="post-content"><p>Another month, another BCS SPA talk. The next SPA Cambridge meeting will take place on Wednesday 14th January at Microsoft Research Centre, Cambridge.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/WhyCantITProjectsBeInsured">Why Can&#8217;t IT Projects be insured?</a><br/>
<strong>Graham Oakes</strong><br/>
<em>January 14th 2009, 7:00pm (light buffet) 7:30pm (talk)</em><br/>
Venue: <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge">Microsoft Research Centre Cambridge</a></p>

<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>

<p>Many organisations, especially small to medium businesses and public sector bodies, are failing to initiate valuable projects. They read statistics such as the Chaos Reports and get scared of the risks of project failure. They talk to IT companies and get confused by the technical jargon. They don&#8217;t trust the consultancy industry to help them navigate this maze. So they don&#8217;t initiate projects that might actually deliver a lot of value. Or if they do initiate projects, they bound them with such tight &#8220;risk mitigation&#8221; practices &#8211; heavyweight procurement processes, long contractual negotiations, burdensome project oversight structures &#8211; that an atmosphere of mistrust and bureaucracy is built in from the outset. This, perversely, increases the risk of failure even further, creating the conditions for an escalating &#8220;cycle of mistrust&#8221;.</p>

<p>This mistrust hurts all of us. Organisations are forgoing potential benefits. Developers are forgoing potential work. Or if we do get work, it&#8217;s set up for failure from the outset.</p>

<p>In the film industry, insurance is used to mitigate some of this mistrust. Independent film producers often need to arrange &#8220;completion bonds&#8221; in order to obtain financing for their films. These are effectively insurance policies that projects will deliver on time and on budget. The financier pays a premium to an independent third party (the guarantor), who then monitors the project and ensures it stays on track. And if it doesn&#8217;t, then the guarantor repays the original financing.</p>

<p>Could this work for IT projects? This talk will look at the role of the guarantor, and the way they might help break the cycle of mistrust in many of our current IT projects. I don&#8217;t have definitive answers, but I do have some thoughts and many questions, so I hope we&#8217;ll have an interesting discussion.</p>

<p>Graham Oakes helps people untangle complex technology, relationships, processes and governance. As an independent consultant, he helps organisations such as Sony Computer Entertainment, The Open University, the Council of Europe and the Port of Dover to define strategy, initiate projects and hence run those projects effectively. Prior to going independent, he was Director of Technology at Sapient Limited, where he ran the project review process for the UK Business Unit. Before that he was Head of Project Management for Psygnosis Ltd (a subsidiary of Sony), where he ran Independent Project Assurance teams working across the UK, Europe and the USA. His book &#8220;Project Reviews, Assurance and Governance&#8221; was published by Gower in October, 2008.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) now has a <a href="http://codeposts.blogspot.com/2008/12/webkit-ported-to-enlightenment.html">port for Webkit</a>. It is not in the Webkit trunk or anything but it is available in git form <a href="http://code.staikos.net/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=webkit;a=shortlog;h=kenneth/efl-port">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried compiling it and using it on my Gnome VM and it works really well. The main missing parts are the NPAPI plug-ins rendering and the video tag support. Since this is an early stage all things will come in time (like video will probably use the Enlightenment Emotion engine). <a href="http://codeposts.blogspot.com/2008/12/webkit-efl-receives-its-first-patch.html">Patches</a> are also coming along.</p>

<p>What I like about Enlightenment and its libraries is that they are all well-defined meaning it has lots of rendering back-ends like DirectFB, Cairo, X11, OpenGL, and tons more. The libraries are all lightweight enough for embedded devices making them even more interesting.</p>

<p>There has even been some work about wrapping the Webkit rendering in a user interface (apart from the example one available in the WebKit git) and it has a really good name <a href="http://blog.gustavobarbieri.com.br/2008/12/22/webkit-efl-interface-prototype/">ewww</a>.</p>

<p>All of these guys have done great work so far and it looks like the start of something good.</p>

<time datetime="2009-01-04T00:00:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true"></time>

<div class="post-content"><p>I am in the process of making my desktop computer into a work computer by removing Windows XP and going down the Ubuntu (8.10 Intrepid Ibex) route.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d share some of the problems I had just in case some other people find my solutions useful since from my Googling I notice quite a few people have some issues. I think also I made the problem a bit worse because I am using 64-bit on my Core2Duo.</p>

<p><strong>Problem #1</strong> : Can&#8217;t get my nVidia GeForce 6600GT to work with the nVidia binary blobs. I was using the latest out of the repositories and then tried the latest from nVidia and all I got was a blank screen and some not very helpful logs. I was getting seriously annoyed after hours of hacking at X configuration files and different nVidia drivers, almost to the point I was going to go out and buy an ATi in the hope open source or at least better drivers would be forthcoming.<br/>
<strong>Solution #1</strong> : The way I ended up having to solve it was using the <a href="ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/">Beta 1.80 drivers from nVidia</a>. Definitely not an ideal solution because I have now discovered problem #2.</p>

<p><strong>Problem #2</strong> : Songbird 1.0.0 won&#8217;t work. There are two places to get 64-bit debs for <a href="http://getsongbird.com">Songbird</a> which are both listed <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Songbird">here</a>. It won&#8217;t start though &#8211; bah! On closer investigation glibc is complaining about and invalid free() call. In the callstack you can see the <a href="http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=124972">culprit is the nVidia driver</a>. So now I have to ask myself do I want Songbird or a proper nVidia driver, but Firefox does work with no problems for me. There is also a report of the problem at the <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/songbird/topics/glibc_2_8_detects_invalid_free_pointer">Songbird customer service site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Problem #3</strong> : Sound didn&#8217;t work for my motherboard. I knew the chip and driver required which was a <em>snd-via82xx</em> (serves me right for using such a cheapskate sound solution). So a quick <em>sudo nano /etc/modules</em> and adding the driver name to the end of the file fixed that problem. It just needed a restart for the kernel to pick up the change.</p>

<p>But, enough about problems, I am very impressed now I have the basic system up and running. The desktop effects are extremely nice and non-intrusive. You need to install the &#8220;Advanced Desktop Effects Settings (ccsm)&#8221; and &#8220;Compiz Fusion Icon&#8221; to gain access to the UI for customisation. I did a few minor tweaks mainly to switch off wobbly windows and enable the Expose-a-like &#8220;Scale&#8221;. In general the user interface all looks great. If you don&#8217;t have the graphics card problems I have there is a good set of instructions <a href="http://reformedmusings.wordpress.com/2008/12/09/compiz-fusion-in-ubuntu-810-intrepid/">here</a> on getting the drivers and running Compiz.</p>

<p>I also installed Flash 10 (for x64) and it worked flawlessly. I even managed to watch the Dr Who announcement on the iPlayer Watch BBC One Now option. Flash does eat CPU but it seems to work fine apart from the fullscreen option on iPlayer. And obviously Firefox is as good as ever. I&#8217;ve installed <a href="http://www.screenlets.org/">Screenlets</a> and used the widget layer available in Compiz for the OSX-like Dashboard.</p>

<p>What I did next was to install <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox 2.1</a> using the <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads">repository method</a> (to override the ones available from Ubuntu). Then I proceeded to install Windows XP that was on this machine in the VM. After finding the right disk installation was faster than when it was actually on the hardware as were reboots. I am really impressed with this. It even activated first time!</p>

<p>Now I have a properly working system I can say that the 12 hours I spent (mostly trying to fix the unfixable) doing this was more than worthwhile because it boots fast, lets me work fast, and is completely controllable. The only hope I have is that there are some mature open-source video drivers (with 3D) out there in the future because then I will know which cards to buy for minimal hair loss. Also I swear the Ubuntu installation takes about ten minutes maximum compared to the unwieldy Windows installation.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>The main reason I have had my head down of late is that I have been beavering away at work on the next version of our <a href="http://camvine.com/products/coda">CODA system</a>. What is CODA? It is a digital signage system from <a href="http://camvine.com/">Camvine</a>, where you configure it all through the web and it&#8217;s ease of use.</p>

<p>We are gearing up to release the new web interface in the new year. This will be v2.0 where we leave behind the remnants of the engineering interface and have a full drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop experience all with a professional spit and polish. Also we will be rolling out the new client software which will add lots of new functionality.</p>

<p>Now we have released a new <a href="http://camvine.com/products/coda/screencasts">screencast of the new website</a> running with the new client software. You can see how to get a system up and running in three minutes, with things like monitor autodiscovery. The soothing tones of <a href="http://michaelandlaura.org.uk/~michael/blog/">Michael Dales</a> provide the voice-over.</p>

<p>The first video on the page shows you the general interface, the second video is the set-up in three minutes.</p>

<p>These are very exciting times at <a href="http://www.camvine.com">Camvine</a> as this platform is an excellent base to build off as well.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Version <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/12/coltrane/">2.7 of WordPress</a> was just released, and being a bit fast on the draw I decided to install it. Using the Instant Upgrade plug-in it upgraded flawlessly as far as I can tell (cue the entire website imploding).</p>

<p>This upgrade breaks quite a few plugins because they are no longer necessary like the one I used to give the admin interface drop down menus.</p>

<p>The new administrative interface is good looking and well thought out. There are also plenty of <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/12/04/wordpress-27-features/">new features</a>.</p>

<p>So, if you see anything broken &#8211; let me know.</p>

</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>Last week Python 3.0 (nee 3000) was released with a big tidy up of the language.  Reading through the new features <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html">here</a> you can see plenty of shifting stuff around. It&#8217;s an interesting endeavor because you rarely get an opportunity to go back and correct the decay that inevitably happens. Since I am a newbie in the grand scheme of things to Python none of it looks particularly difficult to grasp or even change your code to do. I suppose if you have a large and crufty code base doing scary things it might be an issue.</p>

<p>A lot of bytes have been flying around the Internet either in support or more commonly against the Python 3.0 work. So for the prosecution you have posts like <a href="http://mooseyard.com/Jens/2008/12/python-30-whats-the-point/">this</a>, posts in the middle like <a href="http://www.cmlenz.net/archives/2008/12/py3k">this</a>, or the defence like <a href="http://sayspy.blogspot.com/2008/12/whats-with-30-hatin.html">this</a>. You do get <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/2to3.html">tools to help</a> and the <a href="http://sayspy.blogspot.com/2008/12/python-30-porting-docs-started-in-wiki.html">start of some docs</a>&#8230;.</p>

<p>The best thing to come out of the Python 3.0 release discussion is <a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2008/dec/05/python-3000/">this blog post</a>. I&#8217;m sure everyone who has had to work on legacy systems will know the monkeys, the cage, and the firehose. It&#8217;s always good to test that the firehose is actually on&#8230;.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>When I was at the University of Essex I won the Bowden Memorial Prize in my first year. Nothing too odd about that, but then in a magazine whilst I was at Uni I read an article that mentioned Dr Keith Bowden of the Computer Science Department dying in mysterious circumstances in 1982. My interest was piqued but details were hard to come by.</p>

<p>Even in the whizzy days of the Internet and more public access to archives I seem to only be able to find one article that mentions him. All other links all lead back to either the article or reproductions thereof.</p>

<p>It all relates to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative">Strategic Defense Initiative</a> (or Star Wars as it is better known). Apparently the scientists working on it started dying with alarming frequency of dubious circumstances. I don&#8217;t know if it is any more statistically interesting than any other sampling of people over the same period (so I am not peddling some conspiracy theory).</p>

<p>One of the articles can be found here &#8211; <a href="http://codshit.blogspot.com/2007/09/did-22-sdi-researchers-really-all.html">Did 22 SDI Researchers really ALL Commit Suicide?</a> From what I can tell noone ever bothered to actually try and research it and everything just reprints the same thing. It is pretty intere4sting though from the point of view Essex University had someone working on the SDI&#8230;</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a bit lax recently so I thought I&#8217;d do a whistlestop tour of the talks I&#8217;ve been to over the past month.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cambridgebusinesslectures.com/">Tim Campbell &#8211; Cambridge Business Lectures</a><br/>
Covered a lot of ground up from his start in business, through the Apprentice, up to his current venture. What you can tell from his talk is that he is doing what he wants to do now rather than what is expected of him. His current venture is a registered charity that helps young people start up business mainly if they are from disadvantaged backgrounds. I must admit business oriented talks don&#8217;t really do it for me and this was no exception because it always ends up being about the bottom line.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/WhenGoodArchitectureGoesBad">When Good Architecture Goes Bad &#8211; BCS SPA Cambridge</a><br/>
For the restart of the Cambridge BCS SPA meetings we have Mark Dalgarno&#8217;s talk. I&#8217;ve attended <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2008/04/accu-2008-conference.html">this one before</a>. The talk is an interactive session where you have to spot architectural decay and how to stem it and possible reverse it. It&#8217;s a good session for getting to know your fellow attendees as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.software-east.co.uk/">Model Driven Development and Software Product Lines &#8211; Software East</a><br/>
There were two talks for the fee here. First up there was <em>Danilo Beuche &#8211; Get started with Software Product Lines</em>. This covered the theory behind building up a software product line and also showed some of the tool that is used to manage it through Eclipse. It is much more relevant for companies with many products all containing small variations. The second talk was <em>Steven Kelly &#8211; Moving from Coding to Model-Driven Development</em>. This was the stronger of the two talks. The way I read it was that it is a large layer of abstraction to improve productivity and to ower thebarrier for entry for solving problems in the problem domain. The examples mainly involve diagrams (or UML) for it but I think a good DSL would do the trick as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chase.org.uk/?q=node/258">Liquavista &#8211; CHASE Cambridge</a><br/>
This was a talk about new monitor technology company and how you bring technology to market. It was about using electrowetting to make reflective displays (rather than the current backlit world). If the technology does take off you will get cheaper displays and lower power displays. They are currently pushing out actual product in watches in order to have something on the market rather than simply relying on being a technology and licensing company with no released product.</p>

<p>Upcoming there is <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/VisualStudioExtensibility">Visual Studio Extensibility: Extend Your Development Experience</a>.</p>
