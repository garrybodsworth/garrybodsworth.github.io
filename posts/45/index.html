In the recent past the perceived as slow-moving OpenGL ARB (Architecture Review Board) handed over the guidance of OpenGL to the <a href="http://www.khronos.org/">Kronos Group</a>.  The Kronos Group were responsible for the very popular OpenGL ES standard for embedded devices.<br /><br />Something that had completely bypassed me on the <a href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL website</a> was a new <a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/">Pipeline Newsletter</a> for the latest goings on in OpenGL land.  There are currently two volumes:<ul><li><a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/vol001">Volume 001</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/vol002">Volume 002</a></li></ul>In the first volume we are introduced to the OpenGL Ecosystem Working Group which was formed in March 2006.  This group is going to do all the work as developers we will probably find most useful - examples, documentation, testing, etc.  Most interesting though is the thought of the OpenGL SDK which I will come back to.<br /><br />According to the second newsletter there will be two OpenGL specification releases in 2007, with a substantial restructuring of the object model.  Also there is some information about the work for OpenGL on other platforms.  Just the communication from these newsletters makes OpenGL seem much faster moving.<br /><br />But back to the OpenGL SDK.  As the Ecosystem Working Group put it, developers want a single SDK for OpenGL that is ratified by the ARB.  This would also contain the documentation and examples and more.  In the newsletter article <a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/article/vol002_2/">&#8220;One SDK To Rule Them All&#8221;</a> more detail is revealed.  If all goes to plan then this should be a very impressive start.  One part of particular interest is the suggestion there will be more to the SDK, with layers that abstract away platform specifics.  THis can only be a good thing - no need to reinvent the wheel.</div>

Well, that was easy.  OpenGL works seamlessly on a composited desktop with DWM.  I am using the nVidia QuadroFX drivers and it seems okay.<br /><br />Kind of anyway.  Performance is a little off, especially in debug, but this could be related to any number of things.  Also I am getting lots some weird crashes setting OpenGL colours, but that requires more investigation.<br /><br />Anyway, it was far from worst case scenario.</div>

Microsoft have announced the licensing behind the Office 2007 &#8220;ribbon-style&#8221; UI.  The weirdest thing is you are not licensing the source code, you are licensing the &#8220;ideas&#8221;.  It seems related to their current intellectual property surge (with their recent deal with Novell).<br /><br />The details are available from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/11/21/licensing-the-2007-microsoft-office-user-interface.aspx">Jensen Harris&#8217;s blog</a>.  The press release is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2006/nov06/11-21officeui.mspx">here</a>.  The details for the license are <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/office/aa973809.aspx">here</a>.<br /><br />What it amounts to is this:<br /><ul><li>You are allowed to copy the UI style.</li><li>No source code is supplied.</li><li>You are not allowed to use the style if the application is in direct competition to a Microsoft product already using it (ie, a word processor).</li><li>Essentially Microsoft have to sign off on your version.</li></ul>Here is a quote:<br /><blockquote>For those that want to build their own UI that takes advantage of our design guidelines, they will need a license.</blockquote>I&#8217;m not entirely sure how you would show that you did not follow their guidelines which are available in order to implement a similar interface.  And since the guidelines are available on the Internet it is impossible for it not to be found in Google searches and the suchlike.<br /><br />I&#8217;m sorry, but this is a backdoor way to legitimise the idea of software patents, where they are identified with some sort of fuzzy or not so fuzzy description of something that most probably has prior art.  I believe in the sharing of knowledge (this is not the same as sharing sourcecode necessarily).</div>

<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a> has a little post about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/21.html">&#8220;Choices = Headaches&#8221;</a> about UI design.<br /><br />It looks at the start menu and the number of choices to shut down a computer.  I personally was even more concerned about the bad design presenting it to the user (and to a lesser degree there were far too many options), in fact XP did it better.  I realise that there are lots of options, but initially I missed where <span style="font-style:italic;">Restart</span> was.<br /><br />Simply cutting down the number of options is not enough I feel, someone should have sat down and actually used the design that they have foisted on the user.</div>

If you have an MDI application and you are going to run it under Windows Vista you could be in trouble.  I mean the MDI applications that have multiple windows and are not tabbed.  The child windows you will notice are rendered with Windows Basic even in a fully composited theme.<br /><br />Probably where I should start is the &#8220;Desktop Window Manager&#8221; or in your Task Manager dwm.exe.  This is what does the Window effects, so it is not a massive re-architecture but another application providing the extra rendering effects.  This applies the effects to the main window of your application via your graphics card.<br /><br />Now this leads into the MDI problem.  An MDI application hosts multiple windows inside one main window.  The dwm.exe provides the rendering capabilities for your main Windows, not your child windows.  This is where the problem lies, your child windows will be rendered with Aero Basic and hence look out of place in a full Aero desktop.<br /><br />Unfortunately this will make your application look a bit messy and inconsistent.  There is no solution as far as I can tell so far, although I am dedicated to finding an answer.  By far the simplest answer would be to make it a tabbed user interface, although this may not suit some applications.<br /><br />Hopefully I can find some sort of answer soon.</div>

The user interface in Windows Vista simply doesn&#8217;t feel finished.  The technology seems like it is there, but the user interface lacks consistency and the final finishing touches, an subsequently feels a bit pre-release - not the final release.<br /><br />Windows Explorer doesn&#8217;t have toolbars any more, no problem I suppose until you want to go up one folder.  This is beyond me, you have backwards and forwards (but it isn&#8217;t a web-browser), and no toolbar of common functionality.<br /><br />Most applications haven&#8217;t even been touched from their earliest incarnations, see Notepad, Task Manager, Paint, and loads of others.  These are bizarrely much easier to use, but also help to confuse you more due to the lack of overall consistency.<br /><br />In most applications the menu bar is hidden until you hit tab then it magically appears.  If Microsoft don&#8217;t like it then they should have simply excised it from all of the default Vista applications.  I imagine lots of applications with custom drawn menus look pretty weird now.<br /><br />Tabbed property sheets and toolbars look really weird when you let Windows Vista perform the rendering.  The colours aren&#8217;t quite right and this makes it look unprofessional.<br /><br />Firefox looks great in Windows Vista though - much better than it does under XP, and I was pretty happy with it there.</div>

User Access Control (UAC) is the crux of Windows Vista&#8217;s improved security.  Unfortunately it is cumbersome and intrusive, to the point that I already have it disabled.<br /><br />When something tries to alter the registry expect at least three confirmation dialogs to get this to happen.<br /><br />Directory permissions are very odd, mainly due to the restructuring of how everything is stored on the main hard drive.  In order to provide a level of backward compatibility of directories symlinks are used (<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/archives/285">which aren&#8217;t apparently as good as Microsoft were promising</a>), but unfortunately it is completely impossible to follow them as access is always denied.  This is a pain when you want to access your program data.<br /><br />Finding where the data is actually stored, you&#8217;ll end up using the search functionality.<br /><br />Also, Microsoft have you hiding system files by default, which has been the case for years, but you always end up having to switch it on to perform basic tasks.  Unfortunately with the symlinks and the sheer amount of files it is an attempt to make it unusable.  This is trying to make people use the default because the option is so hideous rather than trying to make the option so good you simply must hide the files, which I feel is the wrong way to approach just about anything.</div>

This is the most important aspect of my Windows Vista installation.  You have to confirm that you want to run the installation - par-for-the-course - but you have to run it as administrator.<br /><br />Once installed I knew there were issues with Visual Studio 2005 and Windows Vista after the numerous warning dialogs that Windows Vista pops up.  So you use this to look at the Microsoft website like it suggests, but all you get is a place-holder.  Not really a lot of good for the developer trying to confirm all is well in Vista-Land.<br /><br />Well, I loaded the C++ project up and built it.  Incremental rebuilds seem completely broken for some reason, somehow the pch (pre-compiled header) gets corrupted.  Then the next problem is you can&#8217;t compile individual C++ files.<br /><br />What I have tried doing is increasing the access by running the devenv.exe as administrator, that didn&#8217;t seem to help.<br /><br />So I thought I would try out the Visual Studio 2005 SP1 Beta since it was available for download and after all couldn&#8217;t make it that much more useless.  This was a nightmare to install, make sure that you run it as administrator by using the right-click context menu.  Be aware that this took an hour and a half to install, and I won&#8217;t know until tomorrow whether it was successful or not.  I hope this fixes the problems with the C++ elements in VS2005.</div>

I should be grateful for Vista giving so many headaches - it has given me a mountain of blog-fodder, and has also taught me some stuff I did not realise.<br /><br />I can say from experience installing software is quite a pain as you have to confirm everything.  When you start to run an installer, it locks up your session until you confirm or deny.  And it actually requires a secondary click on another confirmation dialog&#8230;<br /><br />I realise they are trying to make Windows more secure with these extra confirmations, but it can actually become counter-productive.  Once you have seen a similar looking dialog millions of times with more or less the same text you just click automatically without reading it, simply mentally blanking it out.  This is even more dangerous, you could then be confirming anything.<br /><br />Most installers work fine on Vista though, which is a relief even if you have to confirm everything.  If you have an installation created wit <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a>, it looks fantastic.<br /><br />Beware though - anything using Windows Installer runs terribly slow.  I guess it must be doing more work somehow.  Just be aware installing stuff requires lots of coffee breaks(!)<br /><br />Fingers crossed the problems can be fixed with a point release of some sort.</div>

Well, I now have Vista installed after swapping computers.  Something catastrophic happened with my own computer&#8217;s motherboard whilst installing Vista.  After a day trying to get the computer to play ball a new BIOS was installed and Vista could also work properly on that computer.<br /><br />So - a word of warning for installing Vista - <span style="font-weight:bold;">upgrade your BIOS beforehand</span>.  I have no idea why the BIOS is incompatible as the computer is only 18 months old, but at least it now works, and I hope this post stops people heading down the same blind alley.<br /><br />The boot process is definitely taking much longer than Windows XP.  Installing most software is also mostly successful.  The ubiquitous <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a> works seamlessly.</div>
