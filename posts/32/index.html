Recently there has been a lot of development on the <a href="http://llvm.org/">Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)</a>.  It provides a back-end for compilers to allow for optimisation for the entire lifetime of the program.<br /><br />The GLSL in Mesa has been implemented using LLVM.  You can read a little about it <a href="http://zrusin.blogspot.com/2007/05/mesa-and-llvm.html">here</a>.  The OpenGL implementation in <a href="http://macslash.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/18/1248220">Mac OSX Leopard will be implemented using LLVM</a>.<br /><br />There is an interesting article <a href="http://cliffhacks.blogspot.com/2007/03/experimenting-with-llvm.html">here</a> about the speed of LLVM.  It is surprising how close it gets in speed as things currently stand to GCC.<br /><br />Recently there was a development meeting for LLVM in May and the presentations are available <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2007-05/index.html">here</a>.  Of particular interest is the presentation by Apple about a new C front-end for LLVM called Clang with plans to support Objective C and C++.  You can read the slides <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2007-05/09-Naroff-CFE.pdf">here</a> and see the presentation <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2007-05/09-Naroff-CFE.mov">here</a>.  The new frontend is called Clang and probably won&#8217;t be production ready for a while but it is interesting to see where compiler technologies are heading.<br /><br />The most interesting area of LLVM is definitely the whole program optimisation potential of it.  Anyone who has seen the performance gains from using it knows this is good thing.</div>

<a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial (hg)</a> is one of the distributed revision control systems I looked at in a previous post.  I&#8217;ve been looking more closely at these shttp://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gifystems and thinking about how they fit in to the different development methods (closed and open source don&#8217;t normally need the same process).<br /><br />Interestingly there is a talk at Google from last year by one of the main developers Bryan O&#8217;Sullivan on Google Video:<br /><br /><embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-7724296011317502612&#038;hl=en" flashvars=""></embed><br /><br />Version 0.9.4 of Mercurial was released today adding a fair amount of bugfixes and new functionality.  It is a very interesting system as it is implemented in Python, is very efficient and is one of the best for cross platform support out of the distributed revision control systems (with an extension adding the support for Windows file endings).<br /><br />The commandline syntax is simple and easy to use.  It has a wide variety of additional tools and extensions.  Although these are not as mature or in-depth as other systems (like Subversion/CVS/and so on) they are providing a good basis.  Quite a few large projects are using Mercurial in production like Mozilla, OpenSolaris, Xine, and Xen.<br /><br />There is a great book about using Mercurial <a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/">here</a>.  It covers many of the concepts and simply how to use it.  The wiki based website and the mailing lists are also great sources of information.<br /><br />There seems to be lots of GUI tools but none providing full workflow support yet, but hopefully this will happen with time.</div>

<a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/"></a>Before I start I just want to say thanks to all the people leaving comments.  This post actually comes out of what Frabcus has left in the comments about distributed revision control.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been having a serious look into all the distributed revision control systems out there (well, the free ones at least) not only to understand the concepts of them but to see how easy they would be to use since they tend to lack the UI tools.<br /><br />Interestingly Mark Shuttleworth, Ubuntu founder has been discussing distributed revision control on his blog.  There are four posts <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/123">here</a>, <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/124">here</a>, <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/125">here</a> and <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/126">here</a>.<br /><br />But now to the subject of this post, the Tortoises.  First there was <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/">TortoiseCVS</a> which interestingly was started by an ex-NC Graphics employee <a href="http://www.flourish.org/">Francis Irving</a>.  Then there is obviously <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a>.<br /><br />So for these new distributed systems it looks like they are racing for Tortoise type implementations of user interfaces on Windows which would help to attract Windows developers.<br /><br />There is <a href="http://tortoisedarcs.sourceforge.net/">TortoiseDarcs</a> for <a href="http://darcs.net">Darcs</a>.  This is the most complete implementation for the distributed systems so far.  There are some good <a href="http://tortoisedarcs.sourceforge.net/screenshots/screenshots.html">screenshots</a> on the TortoiseDarcs website.<br /><br />For <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> (run by Canonical of Ubuntu fame and what Mark Shuttleworth was talking about on his blog) there is <a href="http://www.hl.id.au/Projects/tortoisebzr/">TortoiseBzr</a>.  It is using TortoiseCVS as a base to expand from.  There is also a placeholder on the wiki for Visual Studio integration.<br /><br />For <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a> there was an announcement on their mailing list that someone has started on <a href="http://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2007-April/012923.html">Tortoise-hg</a> and they ave a small set of functionality.  It hasn&#8217;t been publicly released yet, but hopefully soon.<br /><br />There is no TortoiseGit being looked at, but I think the Windows support requires work before that step is taken I suppose.</div>

I don&#8217;t know what frabcus is talking about.  I made a test repository and tested directory merges, and it seems to work fine.  Are you using &#8220;git mv&#8221; to perform the directory renames?  If not, that&#8217;s your problem.</div>

The thing is I think Git is perfect for Linus,but tat does not make it necessarily so for general use.  Watching teh presentation that Linus gave at Google it seems the merge problems are able to be the patch submitter&#8217;s problem rather than the maintaner&#8217;s, so the miantainer only ever does simple merging.<BR/><BR/>Garry</div>

Thanks for the link to Mark Shuttleworths blog. <BR/><BR/>I&#8217;m a bit stunned that Git can&#8217;t properly handle merging directory renames! Everyone until now has claimed that Git&#8217;s merge support was perfect - it seems like a major defect to me.<BR/><BR/>So that, combined with not being a proper library that is portable to other operating systems, sadly rules out Git.</div>

I&#8217;ve noticed a few commercial products have released free merge tools recently.  I&#8217;ll come onto them after the good open-source ones.<br /><br />I am a massive fan of <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/">KDiff3</a> which provides a very good 3-way merge and has saved my merging hide more times than I can remember.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.winmerge.org">WinMerge</a> is definitely the slickest merge tool for Windows, unfortunately it is only a two-way merge.<br /><br /><a href="http://meld.sourceforge.net/">Meld</a> is an excellent system but although it is cross-platform it really excels on GNOME.  The comparison looks great with the two sides connecting up.<br /><br />And now some commercial ones&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="http://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html">SourceGear DiffMerge 3.0</a> was released recently.  Looks OK as well and it is cross-platform.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/products/merge.html">Perforce Merge Tool</a> was recently released for free.  It looks really quite good and powerful.</div>

There has been no blogging for a couple of weeks because I was on holiday in America, then ill.  But now it is time to get back to blogging since plenty has happened in the world of computers during my break.  I have some emails to reply to from the blog and I will get around to those over the next few days.<br /><br />The best thing about going to America was to get a nice new Macbook Pro - one of the new revisions with the LED backlight.  The model I got was the bottom of the range 2.2GHz Core 2 Duo (4MB cache) 15 inch version, which now comes with 120GB of hard drive.<br /><br />The LED backlight has substantially increased the battery life of the Macbook Pros and the picture quality is astounding.  I got the matte look screen as it provides much better colour tones at a lesser intensity.<br /><br />And OS X - I should never have waited this long to switch to anything other than Windows.  It is astoundingly good.<br /><br />There will probably be more Mac content on the blog in the future but I will still be using Windows in other places so I will still be interested in development on that platform, but probably with a more cross-platform slant.</div>
