<div class="post-content"><p>Lots of people out there are looking for headless web browsers to generate things like thumbnails. In the end most people either roll their own or cheat (use xvfb and grab the pixmap). You could use <a href="http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2009/01/15/capturing-web-pages/">Qt and grab the image</a>, but it still requires xvfb, even if you write your own rendering backend (I assume for font stuff). There are a number of ways to solve the headless rendering problem, unfortunately not all of them are ideal.</p>

<p>For me I am looking at <a href="http://code.staikos.net/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=webkit;a=shortlog;h=kenneth/efl-port">EFL WebKit</a> as the best solution but it is not near maturity and because I quite like the way Enlightenment Foundation Libraries seem to work.</p>

<p>The latest possible solution(s) are born from the <a href="http://clutter-project.org/">Clutter Project</a> which is now under the guidance of Intel. There is <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/clutter">Clutter Webkit</a> which provides a Clutter Actor for rendering webpages essentially to a Cairo surface on the 3D surface. I got it to compile last night and ran a test program but it was pretty slow.</p>

<p>The other one is <a href="http://git.o-hand.com/cgit.cgi/mozilla-headless/">mozilla-headless</a> which looks really interesting by providing a Mozilla library that renders to a Cairo surface. <a href="http://chrislord.net/">Chris Lord</a> the main developer on this made presentation to FOSDEM available <a href="http://chrislord.net/files/fosdem-09-slides.odp">here</a>. There is also a video of it in action <a href="http://chrislord.net/images/mozilla/mozilla-magic.png">here</a> (requires OGG codecs). The source is all available <a href="http://git.o-hand.com/cgit.cgi/mozilla-headless/">here</a> and the embedding into Clutter is available <a href="http://git.clutter-project.org/?r=clutter-mozembed">here</a>. The source code for testing it is <a href="http://git.clutter-project.org/cgit.cgi?url=clutter-mozembed/tree/tests">here</a>.</p>

<p>On a vaguely related note there is an interesting article about using gstreamer through Clutter&#8217;s python bindings &#8211; <a href="http://luisbg.blogalia.com//historias/61951">awesome (gstreamer * clutter)</a>.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>A few weeks back I was looking at some small low-powered computer units. One was really interesting, a passively cooled ultra low voltage tiny computer you could VESA mount to the back of monitors.</p>

<p>It goes under a number of different names, <a href="http://www.bvm-store.com/ProductDetail.asp?fdProductId=486">BVM&#8217;s EPC-500</a>, <a href="http://www.compactpc.com.tw/ebox-4300.htm">the eBox-4300 / 4310</a>, and <a href="MicroClient">the MicroClient Sr</a>. They all seem to be rebranded versions of the same platform, and I think the eBox is the original although I could be proved wrong.</p>

<p>Also the <a href="http://www.liantec.com/product/emboard/EMB-3700.htm">motherboards are available on their own</a> with much more power processors (up to 1.5GHz passively cooled and 2.0GHz with a fan using VIA Eden ULV processors). The spec sheet is <a href="http://download.liantec.com/download/datasheet/EMB-3700.pdf">available</a>.</p>

<p>I was looking quite deeply into this platform to test its potential. I wanted to run Linux on this and it had an in-built video decoding co-processor as well as 3D support through the CX700M chipset. Anyway I eventually managed to get <a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a> running with Compiz effects.</p>

<p>The problem I found with the system is that the drivers are thoroughly inadequate and that the open-source support is nowhere to be seen without VIA helping by supplying the documentation for the video decoding acceleration. The GPU is a <a href="http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/chipsets/c-series/cx700m/">CX700M</a> and the binary drivers are <a href="http://www.viaarena.com/default.aspx?PageID=420&amp;OSID=25&amp;CatID=2580&amp;SubCatID=184">available</a> and the official drivers are <a href="http://linux.via.com.tw/support/downloadFiles.action">available from VIA</a> (Ubuntu 8.10 currently). With these the 3D support is okay apart from some font rendering issues when using Compiz.</p>

<p>Some of the older drivers supply the support for the video decoding co-processor. Unfortunately I could not get a version working with a current version of Ubuntu, which in turn even if it did work would not have supported the 3D graphics properly. Also in order to make use of it you have to jump through a number of extra hoops and also operate as root which is a good security risk(!)</p>

<p>There are two specialised version of the media players that VIA has customised to make use of the drivers that supply the MPEG-2/4/h.264 and WMV9 acceleration. These are <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/viaexp">VeXP (Via Xine Player)</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vemp">VeMP (the VIA enhanced mPlayer)</a>. I did put them into Git repositories starting from the base they branched from so I could work out what the patches did. They rely on closed-source library called libddmpeg.so that is part of some of the older drivers which provides the interface to the video acceleration hardware. This in turn relies n <a href="http://www.trilithium.com/johan/2005/08/linux-gate/">linuxgate.so.1</a> which provides a direct interface into the kernel for interrupts and the suchlike. This probably explains why all these things if you can get them to work require root access. I did try grabbing the library from an older driver and using it on a newer driver, which would have been too good to be true if it worked (it didn&#8217;t but at least I didn&#8217;t kill the system).</p>

<p>The place to go for drivers and utilities is <a href="http://www.viaarena.com/">VIA Arena</a> where they maintain all the older legacy downloads as only the bleeding edge are available on the official VIA website.</p>

<p>There is a special version of <a href="http://www.puppylinux.org/downloads/puplets/mcpup">Puppy Linux</a> that is optimised for the platform. The development website is <a href="http://www.mcpup.org/">here</a>. Unfortunately the media player supplied is not the one that makes use of the co-processor functionality, well it didn&#8217;t for me anyway. Maybe this s worth revisiting again at some point.</p>

<p>There is a blog covering the Microclient Sr <a href="http://microclient.wordpress.com/">here</a> and a Google Group discussin it <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microclient">here</a>. There is also a good <a href="http://nettops.fr/index.php">comprehensive website (in French)</a>. Finally, a couple of reviews are <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS9828354233.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT4708024578.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is a really cool bit of it with nothing else in its price range/features. Unfortunately the Linux support is such a headache, if it worked I would be extremely happy and it would be very interesting to see how it functions with video and 3D. The tiny little box can even do insanely high resolutions of 1920&#215;1440 which would be very useful.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I spent over seven years working in the CAD/CAM industry. It&#8217;s a very archaic industry with virtually no open-source building blocks available, and those that are tend be be extremely old or not even useful.</p>

<p>There are a few green shoots of open-source out there. First up there is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wildcat-cad/">wildcat-cad</a> which is an attempt to create an open-source 3D solid modelling kernel and associated tools.</p>

<p>There is also <a href="http://code.google.com/p/heekscad/">heekscad</a> which is a modelling program using the <a href="http://www.opencascade.org/">OpenCascade</a> solid modelling kernel (GPL licensed I believe). There is also a CAM add-on for heekscad called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/">heekscnc</a> with a lot of associated libraries providing some good functionality.</p>

<p>An additional program is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/voxelcut/">voxelcut</a> which allows for a solid machining simulation to see what damage you&#8217;ll do to your hardened steel.</p>

<p>One of the libraries is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/libarea/">libarea</a> which is for area-clearance algorithms in CAM. This is normally one of the most closely guarded secrets in commercial CAD/CAM so it is interesting to see an open implementation.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/libactp/">libactp</a> is an adaptive clearance toolpath which originated from <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk">Freesteel</a>. They&#8217;ve got it integrated into heekscnc so you can try it out for yourself.</p>

<p>You can keep track of a lot of this stuff through <a href="http://heekscnc.blogspot.com/">Dan Heek&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>

<p>Another unrelated program is <monocam> which uses C-sharp as a development language and has soem interesting algorithms like the drop cutter which provides the basis for most 3D machining algorithms.</p>

So the most interesting <a href="http://camvine.com/files/feedburner.php_.txt">piece of information in this MIT Licensed piece of code</a> is the retrieving of statistics from the API (which is still available after the Google migration). I&#8217;m not a PHP expert or anything (in fact it was my first bit of PHP I have ever written from scratch).</p>

<p>Here is the code which does the Feedburner API retrieval into some PHP variables:</p>

<pre lang="PHP" line="1" file="feedburner.php" colla="+"><?
// Get the blog type because some are still hosted on Feedburner whilst others
// are migrated to Google.
// Options are: "google" and "feedburner"
$blogtype = $_GET["type"];
// Get the blog name for the Feeedburner API.
$blogname = $_GET["blogname"];
// We default to Feedburner if the "type" parameter does not exist.
$base_url = "http://api.feedburner.com/awareness/1.0/GetFeedData?uri=";
if ($blogtype == "google")
    $base_url = "https://feedburner.google.com/api/awareness/1.0/GetFeedData?uri=";
// Query the Feedburner API and parse the statistics.
$xml = simplexml_load_file($base_url . $blogname) or die ("Unable to load XML file!");
$subs = $xml->feed->entry['circulation'];
$hits = $xml->feed->entry['hits'];
$reach = $xml->feed->entry['reach'];
?>
</pre>

<div class="post-content"><p>For the <a href="http://camvine.com/products/coda">CODA</a> application <a href="http://camvine.com/products/coda/support/hints/follow-flickr-tags-your-coda-screen">Follow Flickr tags on your CODA screen</a> we have <a href="http://github.com/mdales/codaflickrtags/tree/master">released some source code on GitHub for this</a>. It&#8217;s a full-on Django App in the repository.</p>

<p>But within there is a little bit of code we call <a href="http://github.com/mdales/codaflickrtags/blob/33b9135d9e68a29a20da6fc85c462f43678e0bc4/feedbutcher.py">FeedButcher</a> which is a very simple piece of Python code which carves up feeds. We needed it to get pictures out of feeds for our Flickr app.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s released under MIT license so if anyone else can find a use for it/improve it &#8211; have fun.</p>
