<div class="post-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been writing Python professionally for about a month and I am still in the process of shaking out my C++isms. This is not a diatribe about how C++ is rubbish, because I think C++ is great. I am making some &#8220;mistakes&#8221; as I am in the learning process.</p>

<p>So today I was writing a function to parse a URL into the useful parts that make it up. I&#8217;d laid it out all nicely, written some unit-tests and it did its job exactly how I wanted. Then I was asked did the Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-urlparse.html">urlparse</a> module not do what I wanted. Damn &#8211; as a C++ developer I&#8217;m used to rolling a lot of stuff that make up the building blocks of the software, so what I did was pretty natural. What I need to learn is to check the Python libraries first before doing obvious things.</p>

<p>The other thing I am rapidly unlearning is writing verbose loops. In C++ I am used to writing loops int he way I am expecting them to be executed. In Python you need to express them differently using list comprehension, which I am liking a lot. I even rewrote some loops today I wrote in my first week where I replaced seven lines with one that expressed the intent of the statement perfectly.</p>

<p>Another thing that weirded me out was creating threads. You create the variables for them, start them off and they know when to clean themselves up&#8230; I think it is because I am still thinking about the C++ scoping rules rather than garbage collecting.</p>

<p>I am sure these Python-ing mistakes won&#8217;t be my last, but it is interesting to wrap your head around some new things. I do miss manually managing my memory and knowing when stuff gets destroyed, I think it probably is because I&#8217;m paranoid and need to relax and go with the flow.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>This post is otherwise known as &#8220;Why multiple monitor support in Windows sucks&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<p>Noah Coad, one of the Program Managers on the Visual Studio team blogged about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/noahc/archive/2007/10/10/multi-monitor-support-in-vs10.aspx">Multi Monitor Support in VS10</a> and it is confirmed on the <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=351965">Microsoft Connect site</a>. When I worked at <a href="http://displaylink.com">DisplayLink</a> we obviously used multiple monitors on Windows in development so any help in that regard is welcomed. When you use multiple monitors every day you do discover the deficiencies in the operation of such set-ups (even on the latest Windows Vista). Things like disappearing windows, incorrect sizing, incorrect windows flags (saying its maximised when it isn&#8217;t leading to all kinds of bizarre effects), losing display configurations, and the most important &#8211; that virtually all Windows applications are designed to be operated when the parent frame is full-screen.</p>

<p>These features that are being suggested should be in the operating system, not just support in certain applications that never even make it into the higher level APIs (how many implementations should there be of ribbon? one provided by the API). These features are also not just the realm of developers, I am sure artists, sound engineers and many other disciplines would like to see better multiple monitor support. Also, when it is in the operating system it is consistent across all applications rather than having similar or completely different behaviour between applications. The main problem with Windows in this regard is if there is a good feature that is applicable to more situations it never propagates up to the API level within the organisation.</p>

<p>By operating system I mean graphical user interface <img src='http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

<time datetime="2008-08-14T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true"></time>

<div class="post-content"><p>A couple of years back when migrating from Visual SourceSafe to Subversion for NC Graphics I decided to piggyback an install of <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> onto the Apache install (I was using it to serve Subversion and it worked a treat). Initially it was just me playing around with it with some feedback from others. At some point we decided to use the wiki for internal documentation and Tristan Day took on the mantle of Benevolent Wiki Dictator. Without him the wiki wouldn&#8217;t have been as well organised or useful.</p>

<p>We put everything on there including Tristan&#8217;s horrific task of porting over old documents that were in various formats like Word or text. When they were online and it was the way they were supposed to be edited they became &#8220;living documents&#8221; that are continually updated. Some areas became repositories of information for what we were currently working on and what was done with some very nice tabe formatting.</p>

<p>It also meant the information was available anywhere with an Internet connection and since it was up to and was well presented if anyone had a question we could say &#8220;look at the wiki&#8221;. The wiki pages were even used for management presentations because it clearly showed our project progress and planning.</p>

<p>One of the things I do nowadays is whenever I do something and make a note of it, say a development process or carefully constructed command line, I put it in the wiki. I do that rather than having loads of notebooks because they are also useful for other developers, even the noddy stuff. The problem is you do need a housekeeper or Benevolent Wiki Dictator to keep it all well organised.</p>

<p>The thing is once you have reached critical mass with the documentation on a wiki then it takes on a life of its own and becomes a communal and extremely important resource. They get even more interesting when you have something like <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> or <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> that integrate bug tracking and source control (and more via plug-ins).</p>

<p>The types of things you should have on a development wiki are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting Up A New Computer &#8211; A well defined process for when you have a new starter that they can follow.</li>
<li>Setting Up A Development Environment &#8211; What you need to do to build and run a product.</li>
<li>Debugging Information &#8211; How to debug the system.</li>
<li>Coding Guidelines &#8211; Which have to be kept up to date making them perfect for a wiki.</li>
<li>Software Licences &#8211; An audit of licences (like GPL etc) used to achieve a product. It&#8217;s always important to know this information.</li>
</ul>


<p>There is tons more but you get the idea of where to start.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I used to track what was going on in <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> very closely because I was in the CAD/CAM industry and 3D graphics are important there. It doesn&#8217;t seem that the changes were as radical as everyone was expecting as it was mentioned that there was a new object model being designed (I seem to remember <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/11/opengl-future-looks-rosey.html">blogging about it</a> nearly two years ago).</p>

<p>You can see the proposed specification from the <a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/article/vol004_1/">OpenGL Pipeline Newsletter 004</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently certain developers are furious about it with some very long and vitriolic discussions. If you really want to inflict them on your brain you can see them <a href="http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=243195&amp;Main=45784#Post243195">here</a>, <a href="http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=243193#Post243193">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=504547&amp;PageSize=25&amp;WhichPage=1">here</a>. It seems the games developers are making the CAD industry scapegoats for any of the problems with the process.</p>

<p>It may not be the radical change but it is at least incremental, and provides a basis to deprecate and add some functionality. I still like the simplicity of using OpenGL, but then again I was never trying out any of the cutting edge features available on the graphics cards. OpenGL and OpenGL|ES are still being used on the Mac, Linux/Unix derivatives, Nintendo (DS and Wii), Playstation, and the iPhone.</p>

<p>You can check out a summaries <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=opengl_3&amp;num=1">here</a> and <a href="http://liquidat.wordpress.com/2008/08/11/opengl-30-released/">here</a> for the main changes with the full spec <a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec30.20080811.pdf">here (PDF)</a>.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>During the <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCamb-2">Barcamb</a> talk &#8220;Panic-Driven Design&#8221;, I realised that it was an umbrella for a whole host of wrongheaded &#8220;something-driven design&#8221;. The one I coined during the talk was one of my pet peeves which is Tickbox-Driven Design.</p>

<p>Tickbox-Driven Design is a close relation of Marketing-Driven Design, it is driven by market conditions and the competitors that you have. It involves having to tick off features that are &#8220;essential&#8221; to be able to sell (in the perception of marketing/sales), they don&#8217;t have to be good, or even complete, but they have to be there yesterday. If a competitor has a certain feature it simply has to be implemented by even diverting resources. These features tend to be poorly specified and probably don&#8217;t even address the underlying requirements.</p>

<p>When tickbox driven design takes over you are constantly playing catch-up and not innovating, and the longer it goes on the harder it becomes to break the cycle. It normally suggests that the problem can&#8217;t be solved by development alone.</p>

<p>As the development tends to be rushed, poorly specified, and pointless (not the greatest motivating factor when you are the person attempting the implementation) the overhead of maintenance becomes much greater than expected. It can also severely affect morale because you constantly have the perception that your product is no good and behind the curve, when in reality it isn&#8217;t always a lost cause.</p>

<p><strong>Articles For Startups</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/08/09/how-to-demo-your-startup/">How To Demo Your Startup</a><br/>
Advice on how to present your start-up and the rules of thumb that can help. I like the concise and quick demo, if you can&#8217;t get the idea across quickly then it is most likely all is lost. My favourite one also works well in creative writing as well, &#8220;leave them wanting more&#8221;, people try to cover everything but it is always good to not show all your cards leaving even more room to impress. This is a well thought out article that also touches on the best practices on presentation skills.</p>

<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/08/10/fr-zoho-founder-offers-5-rules-for-recruiting-well/">Zoho Founder Offers 5 Rules for Recruiting Well</a><br/>
Yet another article on how to recruit. Some good advice, but don&#8217;t make it into a mantra or stand still or you wil find it starts to not work.</p>
