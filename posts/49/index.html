This is a fairly new toolkit on the scene, but that doesn&#8217;t make it particularly lacking.  I have been scouring the Internet for unbiased reviews of most toolkits before downloading them and it is seriously hard to find them.<br /><br /><a href="http://upp.sourceforge.net/">Ultimate++</a> is more than just a GUI toolkit (in fact I could probably say that about every single one I have looked at), it has an IDE, a build system, a visual designer, code-completion, code documentation, and its own standard library.  As a compiler back-end it can use <a href="http://www.mingw.org">Mingw</a>, Visual Studio Toolkit 2003, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/">Visual C++ 2005 Express</a>.<br /><br />It seems that you are unable to use your IDE of choice as Ultimate++ is more of a platform than simply a library.  TheIDE does allow you to simplify starting up development in Ultimate++ since you don&#8217;t have to worry too much about environmental setup and they don&#8217;t have to support multiple IDEs.  TheIDE is OK as a development environment, it lacks a plug-in framework that I could find but it does have a macro language.  This means integration of external development tools seems difficult which I find useful.<br /><br />The basis of Ultimate++ is the NTL which is a replacement for STL due to their perceived deficiencies for the project.  I honestly can&#8217;t say if it is a giant leap forward or reinventing the wheel, I&#8217;ve heard these arguments in the past that turn out to be null and void.<br /><br />But on to the most interesting part - the actual GUI Toolkit.  It has a fairly modest collection of widgets, not as deep as more mature toolkits.  I have noticed it is possible to get a fair amount of flicker from the projects when resizing and a simple solution didn&#8217;t immediately present itself.<br /><br />The user interface is not actually built on the common controls of the operating system, but is custom drawn, and as such in previous versions did not match the widgets of the underlying system in all cases.  This has improved massively recently (gone away completely I believe) thanks to a new Chameleon theming engine that uses the operating system UI theming engine (uxtheme on Windows).<br /><br />What I feel about Ultimate++ is that it is a decent new stab at something a little different to the other UI libraries by making it more of a platform.  I don&#8217;t think it is ready if you are evaluating it for use in a big application.<br /><br />For me when I read <span style="font-style:italic;">&#8220;Rapid development is achieved by the smart and aggressive use of C++ rather than through fancy code generators&#8221;</span> I thought it was interesting, but I always take this kind of stuff with a pinch of salt.  The code although shorter in a manner of speaking I don&#8217;t think is any more readable, and doesn&#8217;t really show any reduction in programmer thought or time (if you are comparing to more modern toolkits).<br /><br />The activity of the community seems fairly large, so they may be able to add functionality faster than other toolkits.  You can check out a fairly in-depth <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/IntroUpp.asp">getting started tutorial on the CodeProject</a>.</div>

&#8220;I have noticed it is possible to get a fair amount of flicker from the projects when resizing and a simple solution didn&#8217;t immediately present itself.&#8221;<br /><br />The solution is simple - call BackPaint method for your window.<br /><br />The reason why this is not default is that even on quite modern machines (like my one year sempron notebook with SIS graphics), there is percievable speed difference for BackPaint mode, so it is left up to the programmer if flicker free is more important than fast (with fast being the default).</div>

This is from a comment by Dean about adding a solution to the repository.  This has been added to the menu, toolbar, and context menu for solutions.<br /><br />Unfortunately this update has only been tested on Visual C++ 2005 Express for the moment as this is all I have to hand, but I am pretty sure these settings should also work for Visual Studio full versions (see the link at the end of this post).  I&#8217;ll update the Visual Studio 2005 Pro versions at some point during the week, or discover I don&#8217;t need to and only maintain one file (which would mean not going grey as fast).<br /><br />You can read the original article <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/tortoisesvn-vsnet-2005-good-stuff.html">here and see some screenshots as well</a>.<br /><br />You can download the .vssettings for Visual Studio <a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/SubversionSettingsVC2005Express.zip">here</a>.</div>

Today I discovered a great little program called <a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/">Songbird</a> which is an open-source rival to <a href="http://www.itunes.com">iTunes</a>.  In some of my previous posts I&#8217;ve been going on about the web GUI, allowing the browser to be come the front end.  Although this looks like a really good project it probably doesn&#8217;t go the whole hog as it is a web-browser in itself.<br /><br />It uses the Mozilla libraries as a foundation to build a web-browser with integrated music/media functionality, or maybe it is media program with an integrated web-browser?  The advantages of using the Mozilla framework is that it is cross-platform and it is a proven technology.  It is also designed around the Firefox design of a core product with extensions to add functionality.  To that end there are plug-ins for iTunes libraries and syncing iPods.  One of the driving forces behind it is the guy behind the original WinAmp.<br /><br />All of the artwork produced for the site is excellent quality and highly amusing(!) which wins points with me.  Maybe I&#8217;m just shallow.  I&#8217;ll be watching this project though as it is really an interesting integration of a heavyweight application and the web.

One of the holy grails in development is a universal GUI library, much like the quest for the one equation that explains life, the universe, and everything.  Unfortunately as it currently stands such a library is further away than ever before.<br /><br />A project that wanted to succeed is the <a href="http://www.crystalclearsoftware.com/cgi-bin/boost_wiki/wiki.pl?BoostGUI">BoostGUI</a> library.  Unfortunately it has never got out of the research stage, let alone the planning stage.  It was envisioned to be the <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost Library</a> addition to make GUI development at least have one standard.  The research page (click on the <a href="http://www.crystalclearsoftware.com/cgi-bin/boost_wiki/wiki.pl?BoostGUI">BoostGUI</a> link) though provides great avenues for people wanting to know more about GUI development, some of the conversations on mailing lists that the wiki links to are excellent and thought-provoking.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t know how all of this will work in ten years time.  It was certainly an admirable aim, but with technologies like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL">XUL</a> getting more traction and getting more mature, the answer may come from a completely different direction to what all of these toolkits are aiming to do.  They&#8217;ll provide a simple cross-platform framework that will get added to over time and eventually have the richness of user interface abilities required by heavier applications.  Certainly I don&#8217;t think these types of libraries can be designed from scratch to be everything, and they have to grow, whereas most GUI toolkits have gaping holes in &#8220;to be implemented&#8221; areas, whereas the simpler domains mean you can easily get 100% coverage and then add more.<br /><br />I can&#8217;t believe this, over the past few weeks I have been talking myself out of heavyweight GUI toolkits&#8230;  Scary stuff.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong these toolkits are still my primary interest for any GUI development, but I wonder what the future could hold as web development has really started to spped up.  We all need not only to think of this new <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm">multi-core future</a> but also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">web-based platform</a> future.</div>

Hi again,<br /><br />Okay, I have the next three artivle mapped out in my head, more VCF, Ultimate++, and OMGUI.  Then on to muti-threaded UI design I think(!)<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think OMGUI has really stalled but the main developer is working on IFM version 2 ( http://ifm.sourceforge.net/ ), which is planned to have a pluggable back end which means he envisions switching over to OMGUI in the future.<br /><br />I think the biggest mistake about GUI toolkits is the territorial fighting, and arbitrary comparisons of features and code which mean nothing.  I think the only answer when looking at all of this is &#8220;Can it do the job I want it to do (and look good)?&#8221;  Some rule themselves out immediately by not having a rich enough feature set.<br /><br />I think that lots of these toolkits are reimplementing and researching everything, whereas it would be nice if there was some wiki or repository that simply documented the platform dependent APIs that people then could use for implementing whatever design they want.  After all open-source is about free-flow of information.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Garry</div>

Yeah, I agree it is more of an issue for data than interface, but it will be interesting to see if anyone can find a way for the actual interface to take advantage of multi-core.<br /><br />Yep, I am reading your blogs. I&#8217;m waiting for YOUR honest opinion of Ultimate++. When evaluating it, please look at some of the source and see if you could actually develop with it. In particular, I&#8217;m looking to see if your preference would be VCF or U++.<br /><br />I know I have a preference, but I won&#8217;t influence you by telling you which I prefer :)<br /><br />I found another GUI kit, called OMGUI. A spinoff of wx; it appears to have stalled right out of the gate.</div>

Hi there, I wasn&#8217;t sure anyone was reading this, so thanks for reading.<br /><br />It&#8217;s surprising how many GUI toolkits do not take care of multi-threading architectures.  In fact none of them have it designed in and you have to implement it yourself.  Although, most GUI tookits have additional support libraries which normally encompass threading.<br /><br />I think the problem is that the multi-threading is more of an issue for the data than the interface.  What normally happens is you write your UI in a threadsafe fashion (don&#8217;t use static data) and have items that need to reflect asynchronous updates via a timer mechanism.  You also need the ability to manage the resources for the user interface as well.<br /><br />In fact there is a conversation going on about multi-threading UI design in the VCF here:<br />http://vcf-online.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=897&st=0&#entry6932<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Garry</div>

On my trawl through GUI toolkits and my general web browsing I have encountered the name <a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/">Juce</a> from time to time.  It&#8217;s not just a GUI toolkit, it aims to be as comprehensive as possible.<br /><br />What stopped me from taking a closer look in the past is that it is a non-native UI, but hey, nothing ventured&#8230;<br /><br />It provides excellent support to essentially a vector graphics based user interface.  It seems really solid and smooth.  The library itself was developed for the audio sequencer application <a href="http://www.mackie.com/products/tracktion2/">Tracktion</a>, and looking more closely at this you can see where the library&#8217;s real power lies.  Providing you don&#8217;t want a platform standard GUI toolkit UI you are away, like if you wanted a midi sequencing apllication to look like a keyboard not a standard windows dialog based application.  I&#8217;m sure it must be possible to apply a Windows XP/Vista theme with enough effort.<br /><br />Juce is also on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juce">Wikipedia</a> which covers the main points from the website.  I recommend downloading the <a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/download.php">example application</a> the Juce website as it is interesting seeing how it behaves.  I do find it all a little blurry, but I think that is the theme supplied not the toolkit itself.</div>

It seems to me there are loads of GUI toolkits out there but virtually none reach maturity, unless pressed by a commercial interest/funding or somehow they manage to reach critical mass with respect to their community activity.<br /><br />Successes certainly have been:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</a> - thanks mainly to being used by KDE to bring it right into the developer consciousness.  It also helps the design is really quite good.<br /></li><li><a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> - now the community is getting seriously large and active.  The comprehensive nature of this library and its maturity helps to draw people in.<br /></li><li>Whatever Microsoft technology they are pushing today - WinForms?  Avalon?  Sheer commercial brute force will get people dumping whatever they were told to use last time in droves and get them to implement it in Microsoft&#8217;s Golden Child Of The Moment.</li><li><a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> is being used in Gnome.  It is certainly well-developed and well-used.<br /></li></ul>In fact it is quite scary how few commercial GUI toolkits there are out there.  You are normally given a low-level set of APIs from the desktop environment and if you are lucky you get a higher-level API (which will definitely not be cross-platform designed).<br /><br />Anyway, to the point of the post&#8230;  You can check out <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/7184/guitool.html">piles and piles of GUI toolkits here</a>.</div>

I must admit, although I am not very interested in running Microsoft Windows Vista as my own operating system at home, I am interested in understanding the UI technologies that are going to be available in it.  It&#8217;s certainly necessary to understand it for work.<br /><br />A more interesting application of these new UI features are how the cross-platform toolkits going to incorporate them (and indeed whether some of it is so useless that it shouldn&#8217;t be incorporated).  I don&#8217;t think that the toolkits will struggle to keep up since each time operating system UIs try to diverge they always end up converging.  I do think that the way these toolkits expand will show which ones are the best designed (you know, the extra functionalty being less kludgey).<br /><br />There is nother decent blog article about DWM <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/greg_schechter/archive/2006/09/14/753605.aspx">here</a>.</div>

At work I use a proprietary scripting language written using a version of Lex and Yacc (the neat Windows implementation from <a href="http://www.bumblebeesoftware.com/index.htm">Bumblebee Software</a> called Parser Generator 2).  Unfortunately it is not as well documented as I would like (although it is in a much beter state with some recent work), and also difficult to maintain.  It has been fun messing around with Lex and Yacc, but Parser Generator 2 hasn&#8217;t been updated since 2003 so I had to spend some time getting it ready for Visual Studio 2005 (I don&#8217;t know what will happen for 64 bit&#8230;)<br /><br />Admittedly this is not an ideal situation, but when this macro language was first dropped in there was not quite the thriving community of different scripting languages available.  I find the whole scripting language thing intensely interesting, so I thought I&#8217;d ruminate on a few.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a><br /><br />Python is well-known, mature and well respected programming language.  It was designed as a programming language not a scripting language so it has a really solid foundation, as it is always harder to retrofit complexity rather than preparing for it at the start.  It has been used in the web domain extensively as well as embedding and a programming language in its own right.<br /><br />It is really extensible with a well defined C API, and also this API allows you to embed an interpreter within your program.  There are arguments that you should extend and not embed Python as a language, but this is a moot point as the design of your program will normally dictate the course you take.<br /><br />Extending the language with your own C++ functionality is almost trivial thanks to projects like <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/python">Boost Python</a> and <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>. There are also many other tools for extending and embedding.  I am definitely a big fan of Boost Python after success playing with it and understanding how it all fits together (and I don&#8217;t forget I promised to go into more detail on setting it up and designing your program around it).<br /><br />Python extensions also include the absolutely brilliant <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a> which exposes the wxWindows library.  The thing about wxPython is that it is widely regarded as a better API than the actual macro based <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> C++ API.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a><br /><br />This was designed as a scripting language.  It is lightweight and fast.  The language has grown to accomodate the features people wanted or needed, and the community around it is massive and thriving.  It is normally the option people go for when they consider Python too &#8220;heavyweight&#8221;, and as such is popular with game developers (for instance the MMORPG Worlds Of Warcraft).<br /><br />This language also has an excellently designed way of binding C++ to the language called <a href="http://luabind.sourceforge.net/">LuaBind</a>.  This is born from the same roots as the Boost Python design, there are plans afoot for the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=34093">Boost Langbinding</a> project (which would also encompass binding to other languages like <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>).<br /><br />There are also many other tools and more available from the <a href="http://lua-users.org/">community</a>, make sure you take a look at the wiki.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.squirrel-lang.org">Squirrel</a><br /><br />I must admit I have been keeping an eye on this project.  It was born from someone&#8217;s frustrations with Lua and they created their own language.  It&#8217;s a young language, but it is surprisingly robust and mature for its age.  The active maintenance also means that it is always working for the latest compilers.<br /><br />Since it is so new it does lack the size of community, but it does have some nice tools.  Squirrel has a C++ language binding tool like LuaBind and Boost Python called <a href="http://wiki.squirrel-lang.org/default.aspx/SquirrelWiki/SqPlus.html">SqPlus</a> which is never normally far behind the release of Squirrel.  I recommend going to have a look at the <a href="http://wiki.squirrel-lang.org/">Squirrel Wiki</a> for a lot more information.<br /><br /><br />Well, that is three languages so far.  Others include <a href="http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/">AngelScript</a>, <a href="http://www.somedude.net/gamemonkey/">GameMonkey</a>, <a href="http://www.nicollet.net/meta/xhed">XHed</a>, <a href="http://eosscript.sourceforge.net/">EO scripting language</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html">Guile</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/">Javascript</a>, <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm">Pawn</a>, <a href="http://www.iolanguage.com/about/">io</a>, and no doubt I am missing some others.  (I&#8217;ve deliberately missed off the CLI based ones.)</div>

There is an interesting explanation as to why the Aero Basic Interface looks the way it does when compared to the Aero accelerated theme.  You can read about it <a href="http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2006/10/12/Frequently-asked-questions-about-the-Aero-Basic-window-frame.aspx">here</a>.<br /><br />It&#8217;s quite an interesting little article since it shows Microsoft banging their heads up against the same limitations as GUI developers have been.</div>
