<div class="post-content"><p>There is a restaurant in London called Inamo where you get to order your food by interacting with your tablecloth. Overhead projectors display your tablecloth and table information and you use a little touchpad like device to interact with the services in the restaurant. You place your orders and can even play games all through the interface.</p>

<p>This is the user interface &#8211; the large circle is used to move the pointer and the small one acts like a button, although tapping the main one also does the same.<br/>

<div class="post-content"><p>I have been running a VM of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/intrepid/beta">Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex</a> for a few days now. I am not overly enamoured by the default theme, mainly the blandness and the window padding which since using my Mac I know is an unnecessary luxury (also to make Vista more manageable make sure you get rid of the crazy 4 pixel window padding).</p>

<p>I decided to use the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/DustTheme">Dust theme</a> because it is understated, looks clean and by default using no window padding. The main bonus is that there is a Firefox theme as well, and as I spend most of my life with open web browsers it deals with that minor niggle of consistency. The screenshots that you will see by following the above link will show you it is well thought out.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5064515/ubuntu-810-gets-optional-darkroom-theme">Lifehacker have posted today</a> there is a new theme called DarkRoom with Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex. It&#8217;s basically a dark (brown) theme. From the screenshots it looks nice and leathery but nowhere near as nice as the Dust theme. I can&#8217;t seem to find if it skins Firefox but since it is an official skin I imagine it must.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>The most exciting thing for me about the new <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/10/14/crunchgear-live-at-the-apple-notebook-event/">MacBooks</a> announced today is seeing the manufacturing process. You can watch the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/#designvideo">video here</a>.</p>

<p>You see I used to write software that did exactly that kind of machining up until about 10 months ago. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing">CAM</a> programming is not for the faint-hearted. Seeing proper videos online of what CAM software actually does is something of a rarity since most CAD/CAM companies obfuscate their online presence.</p>

<p>In the video you can see lots of liquid coolant being pumped onto the solid block whilst the cutter does the hard work. I&#8217;m just wondering what software is being used to create the toolpaths, especially since there are only a handful of packages capable of doing it, as well as a lot of them use the same algorithms internally. In fact whoever&#8217;s software is doing it should be shouting it from the rooftops, its the closest thing the CAM industry has had to publicity</p>

<p>When you see the &#8220;back&#8221; of the laptop shell you can see the toolpath&#8217;s route around the job. It seems to have a large stepover (the gap between paths). I&#8217;d be interested to know how long each one takes to run the toolpath because <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk">I know someone</a> who is really good at writing this type of software. I&#8217;d also be interested to know whether the software I used to work on would have done the job.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing around Intrepid Ibex on my Macbook Pro. I discovered Parallels frankly is pretty poor in Ubuntu support so I decided to try out <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.</p>

<p>I downloaded the latest Intrepid Ibex Beta and it installed quickly and cleanly on the virtual machine. Then I installed the the Guest Additions that improve the performance of working in the virtual machine (the equivalent would not play ball with me on Parallels even with Hardy 8.04). There is a bit of manual tweaking to get it all working because the resolution is stuck at 800&#215;600. What you need to do is edit your <em>xorg.conf</em> by typing the following in terminal <code>sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code></p>

<p>You need to replace the contents of the file with (just choose your resolution by replacing 1024&#215;768):</p>

<pre>Section "Device"
   Identifier   "Configured Video Device"
   Driver    "vboxvideo"
EndSection
Section "Monitor"
    Identifier  "Configured Monitor"

<div class="post-content"><p>There is a good <a href="http://torvalds-family.blogspot.com/2008/10/on-making-releases.html">blog post by Linus Torvalds about making releases</a>. Making releases is extremely difficult and the last stretch is always the most difficult to make.</p>

<p>The most interesting part is the relative quietness as the release approaches with respect to commits. As you are heading towards something more stable the verification and amount of work to diagnose and repair takes more time. The scary parts sounds like the deluge of commits immediately after of patches held back due to stability and testing.</p>

<time datetime="2008-10-12T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true"></time>
</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>Once more the Internet is abuzz with another set of articles denigrating C++. The original <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=532">post by Eric Raymond</a> was linked to from <a href="http://osnews.com/comments/20381">OSNews</a> and had <a href="http://www.blogistan.co.uk/blog/mt.php/2008/10/10/the_enduring_appeal_of_c">a very considered response here</a>. Each language has its good and bad points, the same as anything on this planet. The ire should be pointed at bad programmers, bad education, bad communication and a lack of cold detachment.</p>

<p>The reason the workman quote came into my head wasn&#8217;t a reflection on the programmers making these statements (they are much more talented and prolific than I am). They have obviously been burnt by bad code that they feel could have been avoided if the language was better.</p>

<p>My feeling is that it is always easy to attack something and attempt to tear it down. For something that seems like a scientific field like programming there is virtually no scientific basis for these intuitions apart from anecdotal evidence which is pretty much worthless. All programming languages have good and bad points, some notionally target different domains and some attempt to solve other problems. Some of these problems can involve attempting to lower the cognitive barrier for entry or error rates in less able/interested programmers. A lot of arguments against could easily substitute other programming languages and the articles sound just as feasible.</p>

<p><strong>Bad programmers</strong><br/>
Noone is ever pleased with the quality of their code, but some programmers use dangerous constructs and are simply not qualified to write code. This can colour your own experience of working with a programming language because the human brain is extremely adept at constructing relationships that are simply not there.</p>

<p><strong>Bad education</strong><br/>
Education is important. Having a good basis in mathematics is always a good start, but also being taught the basis of programming in a language neutral form is extremely important. Also when you get to specific languages you are taught the concepts in a fashion that you can see why and how.</p>

<p>The most important aspect though is squarely on the shoulders of the programmer, it is their responsibility to carry on their own development, mainly due to a lack of professional bodies like what exists in other professions to keep their skills up to date. When these two elements align hopefully a programmer can think critically when given the time about the underlying basis of what they are doing.</p>

<p><strong>Bad communication</strong><br/>
Inability to articulate reasoning for decisions is obviously bad, but that isn&#8217;t the biggest problem. It is political communication where attempting to win an argument is done through negative methods. Whether it is true or not it is damaging anyway and obfuscates any real issues that could be addressed.</p>

<p><strong>A lack of cold detachment</strong><br/>
This is seriously difficult to do. We are all guilty of these and it takes a massive amount of effort to achieve. You have to ask yourself what are your goals? To seek out the truth or to win the argument at any cost.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve programmed in a number of programming languages and they all have good and bad points. If someone says there is a bad point about one of them with good reasoning then I either find a workaround or no to avoid it. That is purely pragmatic and does not on its own make a bad language, and even a long list of these does not do so, because each one can have a list just as long. By removing your own personal gut feelings from the equation you can see that any argument is just wasting time from presenting good and solid solutions to problems.</p>

<p>Even statistics can be manipulated to say what you want by loading the test. I have seen massive differences in synthetic benchmarks when compared to real-world applications, which normally comes from creating the benchmark when you already know the result you want to see.</p>

<p>What would be good would be a programming wiki where people looked at the problems and then provide answers to make programming better. I guess this sounds to me like peer-reviewed papers so maybe a better way of accessing good quality papers and knowing their quality.</p>

<p>After all providing solutions is what programmers do, right?</p>
