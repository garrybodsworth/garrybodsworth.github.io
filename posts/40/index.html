I&#8217;m depressed as today, I had an extended demo of a MacBook Pro.  One of the guys at work has just bought one, and now I want one&#8230;<br /><br />It is astonishing simply how good OSX is.  During the demo I saw how much it works like the way I want to use a computer.  When people who have used it say how good it is they are not exaggerating and don&#8217;t have an axe to grind, they just have a computer that makes their life easier.<br /><br />The thing I noticed most about it is that MDI is alive and well.  It&#8217;s not like the Windows MDI where the application encapsulates the sub projects, the operating system in OSX does the heavy lifting.  With this it also makes it much more structured and intuitive.  I can imagine working with loads of Photoshop documents and text documents at once and it all being being intuitive.  It is possible to see all the documents open at once with a zooming out style view, and it is also possible to see all the documents for a particular application.  It may not look as 3D <br /><br />Programs start very quickly and stay memory resident for fast access if necessary.  It is always clear what is going on and the user interface does is always responsive.<br /><br />All of this and I haven&#8217;t mentioned how good it looks.  It has lots of great touches in the UI but none of them take over or clutter the display.  Screenshots dn&#8217;t do it justice - you simply have to see it in the flesh.<br /><br />One great bit of software for OSX is <a href="http://www.neooffice.org/">NeoOffice</a> which is OpenOffice in Mac clothing.  It integrates really well into the way OSX works.  All developers involved deserve kudos for making OpenOffice into NeoOffice which I think is actually an improvement.<br /><br />One bit I wanted to see was X-Code for OSX development since I had heard so much about it.  Unfortunately it is not installed by default.<br /><br />Now I have to go off and save lots of money.</div>

An interesting development from <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> is that this April they are plaaning to release something called <a href="http://www.ubuntustudio.org">Ubuntu Studio</a>.<br /><br />It is a multimedia creation derivative of Ubuntu.  It &#8220;is aimed at the linux audio, video and graphic enthusiast as well as professional&#8221;.  Sounds interesting, lowering the bar for peopel creating content in Linux, but also raising the capabilities at the same time, hopefully giving much needed exposure to some of the related projects.<br /><br />The new derivative has a <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio">wiki</a> where information and planning has started.  I like the graphical design and new logo, but that is just shallow.  Packages planned to be in the distribution can be seen <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/ToPackage">here</a>.</div>

Vista has a new <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=196902178&cid=RSSfeed_TechWeb">Superprefetch feature</a> which is supposed to help launch applications faster because it is supposed to predict the future.<br /><br />Essentially it will give a perceived boost in performance to the user by predicting which applications may be run next and prepares for it.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t know really whether this is such a great idea - surely it would be better to help developers make applications that load faster rather than trying to paper the cracks?  And surely this will effect processor performance further?<br /><br />The application I work on loads in less than a second and is usable and can load substantial files of half a gig of compressed data and be ready to work with in under a minute.  Also, because of the multithreading the program is still usable whilst the loading process is going on.</div>

Microsoft released the first service pack for Visual Studio .NET 2005 a short while back.  You can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/support/vs2005sp1/default.aspx">download it here</a>.  It is available for all flavours including Express through to the Team editions.  Upon running it I am not finding it any faster or more stable though, at least it hasn&#8217;t broken MFC like the beta version of SP1 did.<br /><br />Also this does not cover Vista compatibility, which is a right pain.  They have released the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=fb6bb56a-10b7-4c05-b81c-5863284503cf&displaylang=en">Vista fixes for SP1 as a beta</a> at the moment.  It does improve a few problems like cancelling compilations actually working without needing to kill the cl.exe process from Task Manager, so it would be worthwhile if you are working on C++ in Vista.</div>

Back in the olden days when I was at university I remember one of the projects I had a play with was <a href="http://www.crystalspace3d.org/main/Main_Page">Crystal Space</a>.  I think I discovered it through the old <a href="http://cg.cs.tu-berlin.de/~ki/engines.html">3D Engines List</a>.<br /><br />Finally after ten years <a href="http://www.crystalspace3d.org/main/Crystal_Space_1.0_and_New_Site">version 1.0 of the Crystal Space library has been released</a>.  It&#8217;s great to this see this finally happen as it has been so close for so long (in fat it was pretty usable not long into its development).  One of my favourite technologies it has is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(computer_graphics)">Portal Rendering</a>, this was added because the original version of <a href="http://www.3drealms.com/">Prey</a> (before it got canned and eventually released recently).  At the time it was going to be revolutionary, but I think that style of rendering can produce some cool and crazy effects.</div>

<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> has been going now for getting on to 15 years.  Some of the people developing it and some people using or evaluating it have said that it is old fashioned in design.  This is part of the legacy from being based on a similar design to MFC.<br /><br />Currently wxWidgets makes heavy use of macros in C++, and it also makes a tiny use of STL (after all when development started the STL was not even formalised).  I don&#8217;t think the code is particularly unintuitive or difficult to use, but so much of the API has been set in stone.  One particular area of discussion is the event handling because of the advent of signals and slots.<br /><br />There is a page on the wiki for <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/wiki/index.php/Development:_wxWidgets_3">wxWidgets: The Next Generation</a>.  It is not really actively edited.  I don&#8217;t know whether it will ever get out of the planning stages, I think this is probably due to the fact that the current version is simply good enough to use.  There are other priorities that want/need to be developed, and redesigning the API is not really hugely useful.<br /><br />Other GUI toolkits use some of the more powerful C++ features, but most only use small areas of it.  I think the main advantage of developing a clean API is that it is possible to make many different language bindings.  In fact I think that is what should be aimed at for most modern libraries being developed, because if you can do it in a suitably abstract fashion you&#8217;ll end up with something easily maintainable and as close to future-proof as possible.</div>

One of my guilty pleasures is <a href="http://www.sigames.com">Football Manager (and previously Championship Manager)</a>, it is definitely my favourite type of game - open-ended, considered, and graphics are not the most important part - it is gameplay.<br /><br />On the <a href="http://www.sigames.com">SI Games website</a> there is a forum with a programmers corner.  There is a great little post on the forum by Marc Vaughan (lead developer type guy) about designing a management game.  It covers in quite a lot of depth, although it is not completely finished.</div>

The product I work on uses STL in quite an aggressive way and also it permeates all of the source code, so any change to the performance of it can have very severe knock-on effects.<br /><br />We upgraded to Visual Studio .NET 2005 from Visual Studio .NET 2003 with <a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net/">STLPort</a> 4.6.  We decided to make the switch to Microsoft STL which in coding terms was very simple.  This slowed the entire system down massively, especially in debug mode.  I covered in <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/visual-studio-2005-lets-break.html">a previous post</a> how to gain back some of the performance.  This speeds up the STL by a massive amount as the safe iterator and iterator checking have large overheads.<br /><br />In comparison to STLport the performance in debug is so much slower that it is completely unusable for anything beyond the most simple operations.<br /><br />In release mode the performance is not quite as bad.  For one of our large tests it takes approximately 30000 seconds with our old build system.  With the Microsoft STL with all the possible performance improvements possible the tests took over 36000 seconds to run.  The performance degradation was unacceptable.  It was not only the time but memory as well, with the large data sets we use this causes massive amounts of paging to hard drive.  The Microsoft STL uses about 50% more memory than STLport.<br /><br />Unfortunately STLport is not as easy to debug as the Microsoft implementation is coupled with the debugger.  But the performance degradation is simply too much to ignore.<br /><br />The current version of <a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net/">STLport is 5.1</a> and works with loads of compilers and platforms.</div>

I used SGI STL (the one on which STLPort is based) with VC6, and it was 3 times as fast as  MS STL on average (with up to 7 times in some cases) in release mode. But SGI STL does not compile with newer MS compilers, so I had to switch back to MS STL. Fortunately, I have found STLPort, and now I am back to fast computing!</div>

There really seems to be something wrong with STL in Visual Studio C++ 2005.<br /><br />When we were comparing U++ Core to GCC , MSC 7.1 and MSC 8.0 implementations, MSC 8.0 showed some really weird results, see here:<br /><br />http://www.ultimatepp.org/www$uppweb2$vsstd$en-us.html<br /><br />BTW, -GS- option does quite huge difference for our code.</div>

Hmm, interesting&#8230; And surprising.<br />About the memory side, Microsoft&#8217;s implementation of stringstreams have a memory leak. I don&#8217;t know if that could account for any of the increased memory consumption you noticed. (as far as I know, istringstream and ostringstream are safe to use. It&#8217;s just the general one (std::stringstream) that leaks memory. Can&#8217;t remember the exact details, but it doesn&#8217;t handle multiple inheritance properly (since it inherits from both i- and ostringstream)<br /><br />About debugging, I read somewhere that it&#8217;s possible to get the same support for custom types just by fiddling a bit with some of the configuration files. Of course, now I can&#8217;t remember where I read it. But may be worth a bit of Googling. :)</div>

I was a bit shocked by the results and using STLPort has not only sped up calculation time (we are talking several hours of calculation and a few gigs of memory used) but also helped make the UI more responsive.<br /><br />I thought the comparison between STLPort and MS-STL would have been much closer.</div>
