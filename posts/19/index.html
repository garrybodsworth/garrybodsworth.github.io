<div class="post-content"><p>PyCon UK is a convention for the Python programming language in sunny old Birmingham. This year it is from the 12th to 14th of September and it only costs £75 for all three days.</p>

<p>Now I am using Python every day I think maybe I should attend this year. Looking at the talks that are going on it should be an extremely interesting conference. For a start they have <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/">Mark Shuttleworth</a> (of Canonical/Ubuntu fame) and <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/">Ted Leung</a> to deliver the keynotes.</p>

<p>So far the talks scheduled are the tutorials one Friday which include PyQt4, Django, and Google App Engine. The Django talk will be hosted by <a href="http://www.jacobian.org/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a> who is one of the benevolent dictators of the project (and creator) and he will be outlining version 1.0 (due in September).</p>

<p>The accepted talks can all be viewed <a href="http://www.pyconuk.org/talk_abstracts.html">here</a>. It certainly looks like there is a lot of variety.</p>

<p>Last year <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/">Julian Todd</a> did a talk on <a href="http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/">Public Whip</a> and I believe an impromptu one on CAM development. It was a shame to miss those.</p>

<time datetime="2008-08-08T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true"></time>
</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>A week ago I attended the second <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCamb-2">BarCamb</a> (which is the Cambridge name for <a href="http://barcamp.org/">BarCamp</a>) which is an interactive conference where the attendees create the schedule.</p>

<p>It was hosted at the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Sanger Institute</a> which is part of the very impressive Wellcome Trust Genome Campus.</p>

<p><strong>The Chip With Potential</strong><br/>
To be honest this talk was over my head but it was about a new way of testing blood at a much lower cost than traditional methods.</p>

<p><strong>Panic-Driven Design</strong><br/>
This was an interactive session, where ideas from the crowd got divided into Test-Driven Development and Panic-Driven Development. It did get sidetracked for a while when exploring the deficiencies of TDD, but it was much more fun to go into where development goes wrong.</p>

<p><strong>SWIFT</strong><br/>
Currently the Wellcome Trust use a proprietary system for genome analysis which has a number of shortcomings. So they embarked on a new system that is open-source and written in C++ to be as performant as possible. It sounds like it is a good step forward with such a large contribution in an industry that tries to be very secretive as to its methods. Sounds like it will save money and time when it is online.</p>

<p><strong>It&#8217;s Too Much Information For Me</strong><br/>
Related tot he previous talk, this one talks about the output. The system currently used generates 11,000 PNG and text files for each run bearing in mind there are numerous simultaneous runs. You are ending up with 320Tb of data to sift through. This talk was a story of attempting to parse porrly formed data that people may not even want to look at. Then when the SWIFT system comes online most of this intermediate information will not be generated.</p>

<p><strong>Talking About talks.cam</strong><br/>
<a href="http://talks.cam.ac.uk/">talks.cam</a> is a website that aggregates the talks happening in Cambridge, both for the University and in general. This looks like a very useful resource. Some of the talk went into plans for the future including trying more integration with social networking for education.</p>

<p><strong>The Wireless Epidemic</strong><br/>
This was a talk from an academic paper looking into the propogation of data using only wireless devices. Basically the devices become routers and forward packets when they have the ability to do so due to proximity. Part of this was a study into the movement of data within a group rather than a completely random pattern as most of the simulations have used in the past. I think <a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2005/paper-HuiCha.pdf">this</a> is a related paper to do with pocket-switched networks.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis Workflows</strong><br/>
Using Rakefiles (Ruby Makefiles)</p>

<p><strong>Coda Demo</strong><br/>
A demonstration of <a href="http://www.camvine.com">Camvine</a>&#8216;s Coda system for digital content delivery (that I am now working on). This talk went really well and we let the attendees have access to the screens for the rest of the day which meant we had &#8220;about&#8221; screens for the talks from this point on. It even had my Feedburner API interface page to who the number of readers, unfortunately my blog showed zero subscribers <img src='http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

<p><strong>The Cloud And The Community</strong><br/>
Attempting to bring the community interaction online like Neighbourhood Watch. Unfortunately the take-up hasn&#8217;t been too high possibly because of the technical ability of the members of the community.</p>

<p><strong>Embedded Can Do The Internet Too</strong><br/>
This was a really good talk about small computers that are used as microcontrollers. They can even support a webserver. Some of the applications were power monitoring and supplying the information via a webpage. Simon can sum it up better on his blog <a href="http://mookstar.wordpress.com/2008/08/08/barcamb-2-embedded-can-do-the-internet-too/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What Bjork Has Done For Us (Tangible User Interfaces On The Cheap)</strong><br/>
Since swishy multi-touch is all the rage, this talk was about hacking up a tangible UI for musical purposes (or chemistry purposes for laying out molecules). You can hack up the UIs using <a href="http://reactable.iua.upf.edu/?software">reacTIVision</a> which is open-source.</p>

<p><strong>Distributed Version Control With Git (Panel)</strong><br/>
This was unfortunately the weakest talk of the day, but I think that happens when you choose a fashionable topic with a fashionable solution. I actually started daydreaming because I forgot to go on a rant about my merging problems of the week.</p>

<p>I also remember the talk about superimposing the government&#8217;s statistical data onto Google Maps (unfortunately I forgot to write down the title) which was an excellent talk. It was interesting to see coloured maps of people&#8217;s age ranges in the UK. Unfortunately the developer had to jump through a number of API and data hoops just to get what should be freely available Google Maps information (like polygon areas of the counties or parishes).</p>

<p>Overall it was a great day with a very high quality of talks and I am looking forward to next year&#8217;s.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I spent an extended weekend in Barcelona and thought I&#8217;d share some photos&#8230;</p>

<p><a title="Barcelona View" rel="lightbox[pics86]" href="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-pan1.jpg"><img class="attachment wp-att-92 alignleft" src="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-pan1.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Barcelona View" width="200" height="88" /></a><br/>
You get quite a nice view from the Montjuic Park, and this is part of the panorama.</p>

<p><a title="PC City" rel="lightbox[pics86]" href="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-pccity.jpg"><img class="attachment wp-att-93 alignleft" src="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-pccity.thumbnail.jpg" alt="PC City" width="200" height="76" /></a><br/>
You only get PC City on the continent, whereas in the UK we get a whole PC World&#8230;</p>

<p><a title="Dunkin Coffee" rel="lightbox[pics86]" href="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-dunkincoffee.jpg"><img class="attachment wp-att-94 alignleft" src="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-dunkincoffee.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Dunkin Coffee" width="200" height="92" /></a><br/>
Apparently you also dunk coffee and not donuts&#8230;</p>

<p><a title="Monstruoso" rel="lightbox[pics86]" href="http://upload.programmerslog.com/monstruoso-poster.jpg"><img class="attachment wp-att-90 alignleft" src="http://upload.programmerslog.com/monstruoso-poster.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Monstruoso" width="139" height="200" /></a><br/>
Cloverfield also gets a much cooler name as I spied in a DVD shop in the airport. I don&#8217;t know why but I always say Monstruoso with a Japanese accent.</p>

<p><a title="307" rel="lightbox[pics86]" href="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-307.jpg"><img class="attachment wp-att-95 alignleft" src="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-307.thumbnail.jpg" alt="307" width="200" height="160" /></a><br/>
And just because I thought it made an interesting pic.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mysterytales40.com/">Mystery Tales No 40</a><br/>
In Lost there was a brief glimpse of a comic from the 1950s. Some people got hold of it and have scanned it in and analysed it in the context of Lost. But I love Golden Age comics and the scans are fantastic. The creator credits can be read <a href="http://tcj.com/messboard/viewtopic.php?t=4449&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=mystery+tales">here</a> and it features Steve Ditko&#8217;s first ever work for Marvel (or Atlas as it was known then).</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Because I&#8217;m a cheapskate even when someone else is paying I was trying to find some three-way merge tools for the Mac, unfortunately my Googling didn&#8217;t turn up anything that doesn&#8217;t appear on other platforms. Obviously you have things like ediff3 in emacs and erm&#8230;.</p>

<p>One that I used extensively on Windows (also available for Linux) is <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/">KDiff3</a>. It&#8217;s a great graphical merge tool, and it works on the Mac. I followed the instructions to integrate it into Git (check out the useful <a href="http://notch8.com/articles/2008/06/06/kdiff3-git-win">post here</a>) but I haven&#8217;t had the mergetool successfully fire it up. When I load the files manually it seems to work fine. It&#8217;ll require some more perseverance. KDiff3 is a great tool though and is a pleasure to use.</p>

<p>I decided to also look at <a href="http://meld.sourceforge.net/">Meld</a> through MacPorts. Unfortunately it has to pull in half the universe like a gravity well, so it was still compiling the dependencies when I decided to call it a day. It looks like a good tool though with all the features you would want, but will no doubt need to run on the X11 platform. Also it is regularly updated which is a good sign. So if I can get it to work expect a post about that&#8230;</p>

<p>FileMerge built into the Mac is only a two way tool, and I did consider the Perform Merge Tool which is available for free. So I think I will persevere with the top two.</p>

An early look at Firefox 3.1, particularly of note is the built-in tab switcher preview which previously was only possible using some add-ons which weren&#8217;t particularly snappy.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Unit-testing in Python today&#8230;</p>

<p>Having unit testing built into the language (or at least the standard library) is a good move. With an interpreted language like Python it is invaluable to test the various code paths.</p>

<p>It also helped me find some obvious bugs in my code, which I probably shouldn&#8217;t say in public, entirely because it is embarrassing. That is the first obvious benefit of unit testing. The next benefit is more subtle, you discover how to structure your code in a better fashion because you are thinking about how to test the individual parts of the code.</p>

<p>Unit testing is another option instead of the code checkers PyLint, etc, because the code paths are exercised providing you have written the test. Not perfect, but better than not doing code checking.</p>

<p>The scary thing is you end up with much more testing code than actual executable code. I remember reading somewhere that if that is the case then you are doing something right(!)</p>
