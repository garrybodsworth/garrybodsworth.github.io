Hi G,<BR/><BR/>Got is last night on my home and work PC&#8217;s loving most of the changes.<BR/><BR/>Not so keen on the &#8220;awesome bar&#8221; but have disabled that. <BR/><BR/>For the most part just the speed improvement is worth the upgrade alone.</div>

The <a href="http://programmersatwork.wordpress.com/">Programmers At Work</a> blog have posted a 1986 interview with Bill Gates - you can <a href="http://programmersatwork.wordpress.com/bill-gates-1986/">read it here</a>.<br /><br />What is incredibly bizarre is that he talks a lot of sense and a lot of it is still applicable today.  Certainly 20 years later substitute assembler for C, and C with a scripting language in the article and you can believe it was a recent article.<br /><br />It&#8217;s hard to believe Microsoft is the same company that Bill Gates is talking about in this interview as he has such a pragmatic outlook towards development.  With those attitudes you can see why Microsoft became successful, but it also shows you can&#8217;t stay that way forever without great effort.  Most of my teenage years and adult life I have seen Microsoft as this big monopoly and it was nice to see something that shows what it was like before then.</div>

I&#8217;ve blogged a few times in the past about <a href="http://torjo.com">John Torjo</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://torjo.com/win32gui/index.html">Win32 GUI Generics</a>.  It was really quite an impressive accomplishment using the advanced C++ techniques in Windows development, but was a bit of a rough diamond. I did do some minor changes to my local copy when I was playing around with it to make sure that the widgets used the correct Windows theming engine, and it was surprisingly easy to add which is a testament to the quality of the code.  It did take ages to compile though with all those templates.<br /><br />I notice that now John Torjo has posted <a href="http://torjo.blogspot.com/2008/06/egui-easy-gui-for-c.html">eGUI++ to his blog</a>.  Hopefully this is a progression using all he learnt with his previous iteration in Win32 GUI Generics.<br /><br />There is an article about eGUI++ on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc534994.aspx">MSDN here</a> written by John.  It covers the basics of what he has done and covers some of the features.  It is typesafe at compile time which is great for catching errors early as most GUI toolkits you rarely find those types of problems until runtime (especially when using Windows resources).<br /><br />You can download it from <a href="http://torjo.com/egui/">here</a>.  The example presented on that page is quick and to the point.  Hopefully this is a toolkit to watch.</div>

How do everyone from barbers to musicians become richer, more fulfilled and more civilly engaged in a real information society.

I have been playing with the project management/issue tracker <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> a bit more over the past couple of days.  I have been getting more and more impressed the more I use it because it is so swift to use, by swift I don&#8217;t mean it runs fast, I mean it gets work done with the minimum of fuss.<br /><br />The issue tracking system is pretty simplistic if you do a direct comparison to something like Bugzilla, but it provides the essentials.  The best bit though is the support for custom fields out of the box, so you can pretty much set up your bug report the way you want it.  You can do all the normal things as well like configuring your workflow.<br /><br />Using the listview of issue gives you a great context menu that you can use to do common actions like setting the priority, status, and completion percentage.<br /><br />The issue tracking also integrates time tracking so you can see the progress.  You have a percentage complete as well as estimated time and actual time.  The time estimations can be tagged with which sub-task took the time (like design, code and test).<br /><br />I spent a bit of time messing around with the source control integration.  I decided to try it out with a Git installation I had laying about.  In the end it is pretty simple to actually do, and it provides a simple interface with coloured diffs.  This means it becomes trivial to cross reference issues, documents, code, revisions, and more in one place.  I noticed that the commit comments get added to the reports by adding the issue number.<br /><br />The icing on the cake is that it is all wrapped in a clear and intuitive user interface.  It looks good and makes use of all the Javascript goodness that users come to expect and it actually helps to make it easy to use.</div>

I&#8217;m glad you are enjoying using Redmine.  I&#8217;ve been using it for over a year now and it&#8217;s been a staple in my business ever since.<BR/><BR/>If you have any questions or ideas, I frequently read the forums at Redmine.org and would love to hear your thoughts.<BR/><BR/>Eric</div>

While on my Internet travels I found a bug database system I hadn&#8217;t encounterd before called <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a>.  It&#8217;s open-source and based on <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby-On-Rails</a>, and provides much more than simply bugtracking.  It refers to itself as a project management tool as it provides enough tools to do that.<br /><br />Features include:<br />* Per project wiki and forums<br />* Issue tracking<br />* Source control integration (Subversion, CVS, Darcs, Bazaar, Mercurial, Git)<br />* Gantt chart and calendar<br />* Time tracking functionality<br />* News, documents & files management<br /><br />I did a quick test install on a Ubuntu virtual machine to see what it was like.  The user interface is really quite slick and very easy to use because it makes the most of Javascript.  Even when you have a list view you get a nice context menu to do the simple and most often done changes (priority and the suchlike).<br /><br />One of the most interesting parts I found of the system is the paradigm it uses to partition data.  You create a project and it is possible to have per-project wikis, forums, and repositories.  You can even use different source control systems per project. What makes it interesting is that you can point a project at a sub-branch of a repository, so it would be possible to have a project per branch or group of branches.  This would make it much easier to track implementations on a per-branch basis.<br /><br />With document and wiki management available it is then possible to integrate the peripheral information for a product with the items involved in actually implementing it.  With the integrated wiki you can also have your requirements and design documents easily at hand.<br /><br />I know some of this is very similar to Trac, but it is good to see another tool approaching the same space.  Some of the features like the ease of source control integration is really nice.</div>

I was reading some information about <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a> and watching a few of the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/screencasts">screencasts</a> and I was really impressed about how fast you can create a database-backed website.  One of the good blogs about it is <a href="http://afreshcup.com/">A Fresh Cup</a> where a Microsoft refugee embarks on a career in Rails development.  It pointed to a very interesting article <a href="http://glyphobet.net/blog/essay/228">Rubyâ€™s Not Ready</a> whcih compares Ruby to Python.<br /><br />Through that article I discovered Pyhton has its own &#8220;On-Rails&#8221; equivalent <a href="http://pylonshq.com/">Pylons</a> for rapid website development.  Since Python resources out there are so numerous this would be a very interesting platform to build on.  I guess that also means for enterprising C++ developers using Boost.Python they could have some interesting performance improvements.<br /><br />For the most part Pylons seems about as productive as Rails, as outlined in the <a href="http://wiki.pylonshq.com/display/pylonscookbook/Making+a+Pylons+Blog">tutorial for making a quick blog</a>.<br /><br />It&#8217;s pretty easy to try this stuff out on a <a href="http://www.macports.org/">Mac</a> if you have MacPorts installed (and <a href="http://porticus.alittledrop.com/">Porticus</a> to make it extra nice).</div>

I&#8217;ve been playing around with some of the Alpha/Beta releases of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>.  I haven&#8217;t played around with it for quite a while but some of the advancements look really interesting.<br /><br />Currently Eclipse has <a href="http://update.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/S-3.4M7-200805020100/index.php">3.4.M7</a> is available for download.  One of the most interesting features is that the user interface now supports WPF on Vista.  The Java toolkit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Widget_Toolkit">SWT</a> now has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF</a> back-end, you can see its resolution independence if you look at it through the Magnifier application on Windows.  Also, in general, the user interface looks much more integrated into the native platform.<br /><br />You can see a list of new and newsworthy items for Eclipse <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.com/swt/R3_3/new_and_noteworthy.html">3.3 here</a> and <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.4M3-200711012000/eclipse-news-M3.html">3.4 here</a>.<br /><br />The main reason I was trying out the new version was to give the C/C++ toolkit <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/NewIn50">CDT 5.0</a> a go.  Doug Schaefer has blogged about it <a href="http://cdtdoug.blogspot.com/2008/05/cdt-50-looks-good-now-looking-ahead.html">here</a>.<br /><br />I was just playing a little with it to see how it compared to the older version and it seems a bit faster.  It has the beginnings of some nice refactorings and templates which should make some common coding tasks a bit simpler.<br /><br />Hopefully when this all comes out <a href="http://wascana.sourceforge.net/">Wascana</a> will have a new version released with a nicely packaged C/C++ development environment for Windows.  It could make a compelling alternative to other IDEs, as well as giving you access to other great tools like PyDev (for Python), Mylyn (task and bug management), and I suppose Java as well&#8230;</div>

I&#8217;ve been using Firefox 3 on the Mac for the past month so I thought I&#8217;d share some of my experiences when using it.  There release candidate download page is <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-rc.html">here</a>.<br /><br />The reason I didn&#8217;t start using it beforehand was because I was waiting for a supported version of the <a href="http://www.delicious.com">Del.icio.us</a> bookmarks add-on as it has become indespensible to me.  You can get this <a href="http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2008/04/firefox-3-delicious-and-you.html">here</a>.<br /><br />I run a few add-ons to make it look more integrated with Mac OSX:<br />* <a href="http://en.design-noir.de/mozilla/locationbar2/">Locationbar 2</a> for improving the recognition of URLs.<br />* <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1951">Fission</a> for the progress in the URL field like Safari.<br />* <a href="http://www.takebacktheweb.org/">GrApple Delicious (Blue)</a> theme which looks very good (and integrated on the Mac).<br />* And don&#8217;t forget <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865">AdBlock Plus</a> whichever platform you are running on!<br /><br />With all of those add-ons working (you can also force add-ons to work by using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6543">Nightly Tester Tools</a>) I was ready to use Firefox 3.  For a Beta (and now the Release Candidate) it is amazingly stable.<br /><br />The entire program is much more responsive and lighter on the system resources.  The integration and look and feel (with the add-ons) is excellent, although I would prefer if spell-checking with edit fields to be on by default (although there is a hack <a href="http://www.osxdaily.com/2007/06/06/enable-spell-checking-in-firefox-text-input-fields/">here</a>).<br /><br />In general it is a large step forward although I am not using the biggest new feature - the bookmarks replacement &#8220;Places&#8221;.  As usual though the major feather in Firefox&#8217;s cap is the add-ons and once you have them you find it impossible to use anything else.<br /><br />Also, I am using it on Windows Vista at work and it is fast, responsive and looks much better, although I would prefer not to have the blue tinge to the window.  I&#8217;d recommend upgrading now because once you&#8217;ve tried 3 you can&#8217;t go back.</div>

On the <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> discussion group there is a discussion started about <a href="http://www.nabble.com/High-Cost-of-MS-"Safe"-STL-for-Release-Builds-td16642449.html#a16642449">High Cost of MS &#8220;Safe&#8221; STL for Release Builds</a>.  It is an interesting look at the massive differences between &#8220;safe&#8221; and &#8220;non-safe&#8221; options in Microsoft STL.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think there has been a clear look at the efficiencies and inefficiencies in the MS-STL implementation, especially with the different options (iterator debugging and safe options).  There have been some looks at comparing different STL implementations but it always difficult to do a good comparison, the main problem being comparing the correct &#8220;latest versions&#8221;.<br /><br />Going back a while I was justifying the use of <a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net/">STLPort</a> instead of Microsoft STL supplied with Visual Studio.  Simply, it was a performance thing with both memory and efficiency.  Certainly with the new STLPort visualisers for the Microsoft debugger it is an even playing field for ease of use.<br /><br />You can read those here:<br />* <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/visual-studio-2005-lets-break.html">Visual Studio 2005 - Lets Break Everything!</a> - a bit about how to switch off some of the more annoying &#8220;features&#8221;.<br />* <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/01/development-stlport-versus-microsoft.html">Development - STLPort versus Microsoft STL performance</a> - A quick summary of my observations on the performance in a real-world complex application.<br />* <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/01/more-on-stlport-and-microsoft-stl.html">More on STLPort and Microsoft STL performance</a> - A little more background.</div>
