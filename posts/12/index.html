<h3>VSX: Extend Your Development Experience</h3>

<p><strong>Jean-Marc Prieur (Microsoft)</strong><br/>
<strong>December 10th 2008, 7:00pm (light buffet) 7:30pm (talk)</strong><br/>
<strong>Venue: <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge">MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge</a></strong><br/>
<em>Event sponsored by Red Gate Software.</em></p>

<p><strong> Synopsis: </strong><br/>
Microsoft Visual Studio provides a great set of development tools out of the box, but you may be surprised at how much more you can do with its rich extensibility platform. In this introductory session, we will give you a whirlwind tour of what the Visual Studio Extensibility (VSX) platform has to offer and how you can take advantage of it. Whether you are looking to increase you development team&#8217;s productivity, or you are looking for new business opportunities on the Visual Studio platform, this technical session will help you get started.</p>

<p><strong> Jean-Marc Prieur </strong><br/>
Jean-Marc Prieur is the Program Manager of Microsoft&#8217;s Visual Studio Extensibility Team. After studying at L’Ecole Supérieure d&#8217;Electricité (Supelec), and gaining a Master of Science at Caltech (focusing on Concurrent Computing and Computational Neural Systems), Jean-Marc worked for the French Navy managing Operational Research and Simulation. He is passionate about software modelling, in particular graphical software modelling, meta-modelling and code generating. He is also an extremely passionate early adopter of DSL Tools. Jean-Marc founded the French DSL community with a group of friends, which ran several labs, workshops on DSL Tools, and a VSX Day in Paris (<a href="http://www.dslfactory.org/" target="_top"><a href="http://www.dslfactory.org">http://www.dslfactory.org</a></a>). He joined the Cambridge Visual Studio Ecosystem Team in March 2008 as a Program Manager, and is working with the VSX team to add new features to DSL Tools and enhancing the Visual Studio SDK.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Well, actually more an interesting use of Webkit rather than Chromium I suppose&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/awesomium/">Awesomium</a> enables offscreen rendering of webpages by using the <a href="http://code.google.com/chromium/">Chromium</a> libraries which in turn are based on <a href="http://webkit.org/">Webkit</a>. Rendering to an offscreen buffer means you can embed the web content on things like OpenGL surfaces.</p>

<p>Currently the code only works on Windows (mainly because the Chromium source is not yet fully ported). The reason for using Crome over vanilla Webkit is that it uses its own rendering framework to deliver pixels from multiple processes to the main program window. This means you can use that rendering pipeline more easily because it is not so reliant on platform specifics and uses Skia to put the content together. From what I have tried to work out writing a backend for Webkit is a non-trivial process and tends to require lots of extra plumbing.</p>

<p>The latest version of Awesomium even lets you use the Flash plugin for extra rendering goodness.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>The latest version of the <a href="http://stlab.adobe.com/">Adobe ASL</a> open source C++ libraries was released on November 6th. It&#8217;s a great set libraries that give even more functionality beyond even <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a>.</p>

<p>The latest version also works with the latest 1.37 release of Boost and even contains the <a href="http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/">Intel Threading Building Blocks</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the libraries that are really useful are Move (providing move semantics for your classes), copy-on-write (only copy data when you need to, not by default), ABI safe containers, and the Forest container (for hierarchical data).</p>

<p>There are additional presentations and talks available for download <a href="http://stlab.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Papers_and_Presentations">here</a>. They are well worth having a read through as they present some of the concepts used in the ASL and some good insights into C++.</p>

    The BCS SPA Cambridge talks are about to start again running monthly from November through to June. These are computing talks that are free to attend with a light buffet. The talks are also moving back to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge">Microsoft Research Cambridge</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On November 12th at 7pm <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.software-acumen.com/">Mark Dalgarno</a> is doing his talk <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/WhenGoodArchitectureGoesBad">“When Good Architectures Go Bad”</a>.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      As software evolves its architecture ‘as-is’ deviates from its architecture ‘as-hoped-for’ – the software is said to erode.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Software Erosion can be a problem because:<br /> - the time, effort and risk in implementing further changes increases
    </p>
    
    <p>
      - the effect of further changes becomes harder to predict<br /> - further changes typically cause the ‘as-is’ architecture to deviate further from the ‘as-hoped-for’ architecture – the situation becomes worse.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This session looks at examples of software erosion and explores practices to prevent or slow such decay. Participants should come prepared with architectural ‘war stories’. There will be a couple of group exercises but no test at the end.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    This will be a good session to meet other attendees and to tell your war stories and stories of hope (although I think the bad ones are always more entertaining).

</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>This month <a href="http://www.boost.org/users/news/version_1_37_0">Boost 1.37 has been released</a>. It&#8217;s the latest version of the extremely useful peer reviewed C++ libraries that a large portion of has fed into the latest C++ standards.</p>

<p>There is only one new library this time out which is Boost.Proto:</p>

<blockquote><p>Proto is a framework for building Domain Specific Embedded Languages in C++. It provides tools for constructing, type-checking, transforming and executing expression templates. More specifically, Proto provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>An expression tree data structure.</li>
<li>A mechanism for giving expressions additional behaviors and members.</li>
<li>Operator overloads for building the tree from an expression.</li>
<li>Utilities for defining the grammar to which an expression must conform.</li>
<li>An extensible mechanism for immediately executing an expression template.</li>
<li>An extensible set of tree transformations to apply to expression trees.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There are the usual myriad of bug fixes with the other libraries. They are still following their regular release cycles which is a good thing.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>It has been a while since I have said anything about upcoming talks in Cambridge.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cambridgebusinesslectures.com/">The original Apprentice is coming to town &#8211; Cambridge Business Lectures</a><br/>
<strong>10th November 2008 5.30pm</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Tim Campbell, the winner of the first series of The Apprentice, is coming to Cambridge. Tim will talking on “Much sugar is a good thing: the power of mentoring”.</p>

<p>Tim stands out from other Apprentice contestants &#8211; and winners &#8211; as being a man of substance and depth as well as charisma. Since leaving Amstrad, he’s set up two ventures. Most recently, his Bright Ideas Trust gives advice and funding to young people to help them get their ideas off the ground.</p>

<p>Tim will be talking at Robinson College, Cambridge at 5:30pm on Monday November 10th. The event is free, but you need to <a href="http://www.regonline.co.uk/Checkin.asp?EventId=655098">book a place</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m really interested to see what life after what essentially amounts to a &#8220;reaity&#8221; TV programme is like, because it sounds like he has accomplished some really good things. Unfortunately his era at Amstrad was recent so I guess no questions about the CPC464&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.software-east.co.uk/">Software East</a><br/>
<strong>20th November 2008 7pm</strong></p>

<p>There are two speakers for this event:</p>

<ul>
<li>Steven Kelly &#8211; Moving from Coding to Model-Driven Development</li>
<li>Danilo Beuche &#8211; Get started with Software Product Lines &#8211; Key success factors and what to avoid</li>
</ul>


<p>The cost of this event is £15 which includes light buffet.</p>
