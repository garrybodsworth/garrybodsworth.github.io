In a previous post I have mentioned the splendid free IDE <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">Code::Blocks</a>, but in the dark old days of a few years ago, before Microsoft gave stuff away for free and development was quite an expensive endevour, there existed <a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html">DevC++</a>.  It was a free IDE written in Delphi that provided good library management and also was an IDE for GCC in Windows.<br /><br />Over the years other IDEs have sprung up and essentially overtaken Dev-C++ in terms of features and quality.  Then someone decided to make a branch, one that was going to have integrated GUI editing.  This project eventually became <a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/">wxDevC++</a>.<br /><br />A new version has just been released with even more features from wxWidgets integrated into the GUI editor.  Most importantly it now has support for Visual C++ compilers (v6, 2003, and 2005) which is interesting.  I need to go and check out this IDE in more detail, but it is good to see it is more than alive and kicking.  If you are a wxWidgets developer it is one of the most comprehensive integrated IDEs for developing and looks like it will be going from strength to strength judging from the <a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/changelog.php#610">changelog</a> for this version.<br /><br />And here is a little screenshot with the GUI editor up from their <a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/">website</a>:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/1600/thumbnail.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/320/thumbnail.png" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>

On the topic of: visually oriented programming IDEs with GUI designer matrices, U++ another C++ development tool is up and coming rapidly.<BR/><BR/> It is powerful with stramlined template handling for C++ and the code files look like C#&#8217;s in size.<BR/><BR/> The com for the control components never seems to go past a sentence&#8217;s worth of statement.<BR/><BR/> Succint coding is U++ tagline.<BR/><BR/> The only noticable problems with U++ are: the actual coding comes off as a branching of standard C++ bringing with it a culture shock for C++ programmers, the bug report output is a bit on the vague side, the IDE is a bit too strict with the setup of a project, and there are far too few reference resources.<BR/><BR/> Do not be fooled by the short-comings as the resources that do exist are excellent. With the coding you can be comfortable in about thirty days I would say and your off to the races.<BR/><BR/> The U++ IDE is definitely about brevity, precision, speed, more speed, and cross-platform development with mobile computational devices coming up in the near future.<BR/><BR/> Check into U++; you will not be disappointed.</div>

DevC++ was definitely a hallmark in the history of open source IDE technology. Ansi and ISO C/C++ handling as-well-as the Package Manager(PackMan) threw DevC++ to the forefront.<BR/><BR/> wxDevC++ has and will continue to leverage these same powerful frameworks. The look and feel of wxDevC++ is quite similar to Visual Studio products bringing with it a familiarity. Unfortunately the controls are a bit unmanaged and thrown together at the moment.<BR/><BR/> The newer wxWidgets v2.8 recommendations for wxWidget&#8217;s namespace change is incorporated. Sizer components are however buggy and are of a serious issue within the wxWidget community. Proportions are not handled correctly at all and are paramount within the sizer struct.<BR/><BR/> In conclusion: it would appear that the product is operation with a seriously limited capacity at this point. wxDevC++ does handle generic C++, virtual classes, and references very nicely. This alone says that the product is capable.<BR/><BR/> The development stage of wxDevC++ would realistically put one in the frame of mind that: the IDE is a no holds barred peddle to the metal dev endev. Something this young with this broad a scope would have more serious issues to contend with.<BR/><BR/> the developers of wxDevC++ have been hard at work and have just started on the path. I suspect that the product with such a young and talented staff of developers is going to provide an excellent platform for cross development systems.</div>

Another stop on the way to a fuller look at the Vista User Interface Guidelines.  This will be the last one I promise&#8230;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">WINDOWS XP</span><br /><br />For designing any user interface in Windows XP (and generally Windows) you need to know <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch14e.asp">Design Specifications and Guidelines - Visual Design</a>.  This specifies how you are supposed to lay out your user interface and how allthe elements should fit together.  I use this to hand code my resources for MFC user interfaces, when it is all consistent you will be surprised how much better and more professional it looks.  One thing I can&#8217;t remember if it is covered is make sure your tab order is correct as when working with resources it is possible to get it wrong.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">VISTA</span><br /><br />The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/UxGuide/UXGuide/Home.asp">Windows Vista User Experience Guidelines</a> have been available for a while.  By available I mean exist as a placeholder that someone will eventually be forced to write.<br /><br />The most substantive part of the Vista UI Guidelines is the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/UxGuide/UXGuide/Resources/TopRules/TopRules.asp">Top Rules for the Windows Vista User Experience</a> which are extremely shallow and a bit of a red herring for good UI design.  It even asks for things that the applications provided with Windows Vista are unable to follow.<br /><br />All of the Vista guideline are so shallow that even the most obvious things like what will be the user interface differences between Basic and other Vista versions are not covered.  For those of you that haven&#8217;t heard the standard home version of Vista will be supplied with the &#8220;Aero Basic&#8221; theme that does not have the bells and whistles.  It makes no mention of how to lay out controls consistently and intuitively.  Also it says use Vista style icons and so on, unfortunately the icon guidelines hve not been published yet.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">APPLE</span><br /><br />Trust <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> to show you how it is done.  They have comrehensive developer documentation on how to supply a well integrated consistent interface for OS X.  They can be read <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/">here</a>.<br /><br />The human interface guidelines are available <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/index.html">here</a>.  This covers all you need to know for a professional looking OS X application.  The documents keep evolving and get better like with the recent <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGIcons/chapter_14_section_2.html">icon addition</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Gnome</span><br /><br />The Gnome desktop has a well know <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/2.0/">human interface guidelines</a>.  It is really quite in-depth and puts Microsoft to shame.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">KDE</span><br /><br />The popular Linux desktop environment also has a set of <a href="http://developer.kde.org/documentation/standards/kde/style/basics/index.html">user interface guidelines</a>.<br /><br /><br />You can read a previous post about icon guidelines for various platforms <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/icons-icons-icons.html">here</a>.</div>

Windows Vista is just around the corner.  As a developer you worry about what a new OS version is going to do to the program you work on, most incremental cases are pretty trivial, XP introduced a virtually undocumented theming API (and it still pretty much is), SP2 opened up a whole can of pain, Vista has even bigger problems on the horizon.<br /><br />But this post isn&#8217;t about those migration problems, I&#8217;ll be covering them as I tear my hair out at work, much like my migrations to Visual Studio 2005.<br /><br />From this GUI developer&#8217;s point of view I&#8217;ll cover my thought process:<ul><li><b>&#8220;Does my UI work under this upgraded platform?&#8221;</b><br />Ignoring the platform issues, does the user interface work on the new platform.  This means does it render without causing corruption and does it crash?  It&#8217;s a simple case of running the executable.</li><li><b>&#8220;Does it look good?&#8221;</b><br />Now the user interface is usable, does it look integrated with the rest of the system?  This means checking custom draw items work and match the system theme.  Once you&#8217;ve made sure you have made no glaring errors the program is probably usable on the new platform.</li><li><b>&#8220;Does it look consistent with other programs on that platform?&#8221;</b><br />Now this is where the realy hard work start.  Some platforms actually provide user interface (HCI) guidelines that are worth the virtual paper they are written on like the Apple ones, some are not like Vista.  My next post will cover this point in greater detail.</li><li><b>&#8220;Has the migration made our user&#8217;s lives better or easier?&#8221;</b><br />Has the shiny new look cheered our user&#8217;s lives up?  Has it made the user&#8217;s lives easier, say for instance the new common controls provide even more functionality as standard?</li><li><b>&#8220;What can be added incrementally?&#8221;</b><br />Are there new features available to the developers that can be added in an incremental fashion, either phasing out old items or introducing new paradigms.  This will also be the implementation of features seen as extras by the HCI guidelines.</li><li><b>&#8220;Can you separate yourself from the crowd?&#8221;</b><br />This is the lowest priority item.  Are there things you can do that look good, but also serve to separate you from the rest of the crowd (but please keep them within the HCI guidelines, PLEASE!)</li></ul>Well, I will end this random ramble though my thought processes, but I am expending valuable brain power on this knowing I have to sort this out in the near future.  Since Vista is going to manufacturers very soon it all seems tangible now.</div>

No, I haven&#8217;t lost all typing skills, it is really called qooxdoo.<br /><br /><a href="http://qooxdoo.org/">qooxdoo</a> (see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qooxdoo">Wikipedia</a>) is an AJAX targetted Javascript user interface toolkit.  It is surprisingly fully featured and shows how far along web-based toolkits have come.  Well, when I say surprising, I mean shocking.<br /><br />The toolkit is LGPL licensed and has a large set of widgets available.  I think the best way to describe it is to send you to the demo page <a href="http://qooxdoo.org/demo">here</a> and I would recommend you look at <a href="http://demo.qooxdoo.org/html/at-a-glance/index.html">this example</a> in particular.  There is no point in looking at the screenshots as playing round with the demos demonstrates its depth of features and how polished they are.<br /><br />The advantages of this kit for web development include the abstraction away of web browser specifics and automatic browser detection.  It has things that are normally only seen in fully fledged desktop environments like drag-n-drop support.  Like I said earlier though I think the demos speak for themselves.</div>

No probs Si.  I found the whole thing astonishing when I found it, then I rebuilt my computer and forgot about it completely until a bit of paper just saying qooxdoo turned up by the computer today ;)<br /><br />If it was possible to make a web browser with no frame and a transparent window it would look pretty integrated with the system (not perfect for XP though at the moment).</div>

I reckon I am probably in the minority here, but I am less concerned about the code format of GUI toolkits.  I am more concerned about what it is capable of and what it looks and feels like.  After all it is more than possible to write an abstraction layer on top of it to hide some of the less nice features, and adapting to different styles is a learning process.<br /><br />Whilst screenshots can be misleading or more often understating the abilities of a toolkit, a well-defined example application is more than enough to decide whether to evaluate further.  With online type user interfaces it is much easier, whereas you need an executable to try things out for most others.<br /><br />It&#8217;s surprising how few go down this route as it is such a good way to show how good an application is on your platform.

Hi Garry,<br /><br />I have 1 more for your list. It is the Adobe Source Libraries (ASL) example. It isn&#8217;t obvious how to get it and use it, so:<br /><br />You can get it from their sourceforge download site here :<br />http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=132417&package_id=145420<br /><br />and for Windows, you want the asl_1.0.20_begin_win.zip file. Mac is available also.<br /><br />Unzip, and you will have an app called begin.exe.  Start it. It runs 1 example using their .adam and .eve files. To try out other UI examples, drag a pair of .adam and .eve files from the examples directory onto the main app window (the wide-short window), and it loads up a new window from the .adam and .eve form file specs.</div>

I&#8217;ve covered a variety of the areas for porting to Visual Studio 2005 in some previous posts, as it is not as simple as it should be.  It seems that although it is relatively easy to get it compiled there is a lot of performance and stability work to be undertaken.<br /><br />The posts are:<ul><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/boost-library-and-visual-studio-2005.html">Boost and VS2005</a></li><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/visual-studio-2005-lets-break.html">VS2005 floating point and STL</a></li></ul>There is also one area that needs looking at as you may notice you are not getting the Windows XP look and feel.  This is a pain because the way manifests work has changed.  You need to go to your <span style="font-style:italic;">stdafx.h</span> file or the main <span style="font-style:italic;">.cpp</span> file and add the following:<br /><br /><table style="font-size:75%;border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; background-color: #f9f9f9;"><tr><td><code><pre width=80>#if _MSC_VER >= 1400<br />#ifdef _UNICODE<br /> #if defined _M_IX86<br />  #pragma comment(linker,"/manifestdependency:\"type='win32' name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' processorArchitecture='x86' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*'\"")<br /> #elif defined _M_IA64<br />  #pragma comment(linker,"/manifestdependency:\"type='win32' name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' processorArchitecture='ia64' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*'\"")<br /> #elif defined _M_X64<br />  #pragma comment(linker,"/manifestdependency:\"type='win32' name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' processorArchitecture='amd64' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*'\"")<br /> #else<br />  #pragma comment(linker,"/manifestdependency:\"type='win32' name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' processorArchitecture='*' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*'\"")<br /> #endif<br />#endif //_UNICODE<br />#endif //_MSC_VER >= 1400</pre></code></td></tr></table>Just copy and paste this, the formatting will be correct.</div>

I&#8217;ve already covered the <a href="http://www.vcf-online.org/">Visual Component Framework (VCF)</a>, but I feel like talking about it a bit more.<br /><br />Before starting make sure you check out the <a href="http://vcf-online.org/docs/ref_manual/ch01.html">list of features</a> from the VCF documentation, as I won&#8217;t repeat them all here (after all it is what hyperlinking is invented for).<br /><br />There are three core libraries in the VCF:<ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">FoundationKit</span> - The base library for the VCF providing the lower level building blocks for the other libraries.  It provides the RTTI system, string support, threading, and much more.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">GraphicsKit</span> - It&#8217;s the library that provides the graphic rendering and graphics formats.  It has some great functionality from <a href="http://www.antigrain.com/">libAGG (The Anti-Grain Geometry Tookit)</a> which I have mentioined in some previous posts.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ApplicationKit</span> - The GUI functionality itself.  Obviously this is the largest component and covers the widgets, events, focus, and more.  It&#8217;s almost so big there must be a thought to break it down further into smaller functional components.</li></ul>There are more libraries (kits) that contribute functionality including HTML, OpenGL, the upcoming Regex, and a few more.<br /><br />One compaint I hear is that the libraries are too large (in file size) which I have never understood as an argument for or against a toolkit (unless we are talking MASSIVE).  It is rare that a toolkit has a small amount of dependencies, plus with the VCF you don&#8217;t need everything if you are into that (but it is obviously more work to do).<br /><br />I have found writing code in VCF is surprisingly concise and easy to understand.  If you have come from an MFC or wxWidgets background, the event system will need some understanding.  I was trying out writing something to simulate docking with a small amount of success, although I haven&#8217;t done as much coding for it as I probably should have.  It wasn&#8217;t more than a little experiment to try out something in the VCF.<br /><br />I probably should list the major features that it lacks, which are docking windows (and toolbars), fully implemented cross-platform support, scripting language bindings (<span style="font-weight:bold;">Edit:</span> There is a basic Javascript engine that has not made it into the release yet), and the finished documentation.<br /><br />The cross platform aspect remains incomplete for Linux and Mac although the Linux version has pushed on in the recent past.  Actually I find it a bit disappointing that it does not have a large community built up around it like some other toolkits.  The foundations seem so solid that the system is begging to be extended more.<br /><br />Make sure you read the documentation <a href="http://vcf-online.org/docs/ref_manual/">here</a> which is excellent although not comprehensive, and not completely finished.  Also check out the VCF articles on the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">CodeProject</a> (do a search for VCF).<br /><br />As you can tell I am quite positive about this toolkit, it is almost too understated for its own good.  I can imagine developing something quite complex in it and being able to extend it for more complex things.</div>

Just a note, we do have a basic JavaScript engine that the <a href="http://vcfbuilder.org">VCF Builder</a> uses. This is not in the formal VCF at the moment however.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Jim (ddiego)</div>

<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> is addictive, and gives a wealth of useful information, like 75% of the readers here use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Firefox</a>.  Firefox 2.0 comes the same week as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0</a> has arrived.  So there are two installation experiences to tell.<br /><br />IE7 starts installation by unpacking the installation to a temporary directory, and then begins some enforced Windows Updates.  Then it begins an unusually long installation (I am still not sure why), overall taking 10-15 minutes.  Then it needs you to reboot.<br /><br />I was going to wait for automatic updates to pick up Firefox 2.0, but I decided to upgrade now.  The installation was a case of blink and you&#8217;ll miss it.  No reboot.  A minor startup delay of about ten seconds due to checking the plug-ins for updates, and I was away.  The new UI takes a bit of getting used to visually, but I think I will end up preferring it, and it pretty much all works the same.  The tab shading is a bit unnecessary especially since the rest of the UI isn&#8217;t as shaded.  Check out a comprehensive review <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2006/10/firefox-2-review/">here</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&id=0&t=216"><img border="0" alt="Firefox 2" title="Firefox 2" src="http://sfx-images.mozilla.org/affiliates/Buttons/firefox2/firefox-spread-btn-5.png"/></a></div>

<a href="http://www.codeblocks.org">Code::Blocks</a> is a free open-source IDE written in <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a>, making good use of <a href="http://www.kirix.com/community/wxaui.html">wxAUI</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxflatnotebook">wxFlatNoteBook</a>.<br /><br />If you decide to give it a go make sure you use the <a href="http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=d5fa3b82510a71c14c07404cb09e1492&board=20.0">Nightly Builds</a>, you&#8217;ll need <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> to decompress the files as well.  The nightly builds are well beyond the last &#8220;release&#8221; called RC2.  I&#8217;ve found the nightly builds stable and mature.  There are lots of plug-ins and project templates.<br /><br />One of the major plug-ins that has recently gone through a major rewrite is the wxSmith plug-in which is a visual GUI designer for the IDE.  If this turns out to be good or even just average it would give Code::Blocks a major advantage for adoption.<br /><br />Code::Blocks is able to be the IDE for a variety of <a href="http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php?title=Installing_a_supported_compiler">compiler back-ends</a>.  I completely forgot to mention it is cross-platform.  It seems to scale up pretty well to larger projects, and can even convert your Visual Studio solutions.<br /><br />It also provides scripting through <a href="http://www.squirrel-lang.org">Squirrel</a>/<a href="http://wiki.squirrel-lang.org/default.aspx/SquirrelWiki/SqPlus.html">SqPlus</a> (which I&#8217;ve mentioned I like in a previous post).<br /><br />I must confess I am not currently using it, but I am using the Visual C++ Express Edition.  The only excuse I have is that I have Visual C++ set up perfectly for what I want to do.  If you are curious go and check it out, you won&#8217;t be disappointed.</div>

Yep, this is a pretty good IDE. If you develop with MinGW, this is THE IDE to use. I&#8217;ve never run it on Linux or OSX, so I can&#8217;t speak for those.<br /><br />But, I&#8217;m with you, VC++2005 is my favorite.</div>

As <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> development gathers speed more new features are appearing.  These look like add-ins that will become part of the core toolkit.<br /><br />First up there is <a href="http://www.kirix.com/community/wxaui.html">wxAUI (wxWidgets Advanced User Interface)</a> which provides a really nice and simple docking toolkit.  It has great looking hint boxes for docking and the ability to use transparency for drag effects.  It also has a notebook style tabbed interface built into it, and provides toolbar docking which is really top notch.  This is now part of the main <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=9863">2.7 development distribution</a>.<br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxflatnotebook"><br />wxFlatNoteBook</a> is a tabbed &#8220;notebook&#8221; interface much like what you see in Visual Studio (or indeed <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org">Code::Blocks</a> which uses it).  It has lots of professional looking rendering and custom drawn styles.<br /><br /><a href="http://wxforum.shadonet.com/viewtopic.php?t=10497">wxFlatMenu</a> has just been released on the wxWidgets forums.  This provides custom drawn menus much like what you see in Windows XP applications like Office and Visual Studio (both 2003/2005 and 2007 look).<br /><br />wxFlatNoteBook and wxFlatMenu have not been put into the main trunk, but there are plans afoot to integrate both into the wxAUI interface.  With this collection of very decent extensions it opens up wxWidgets to more possibilities.</div>
