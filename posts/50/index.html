A new development version of <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> has been released.  This is in a lead up to version 2.8, which will be the latest stable version.<br /><br />The new version of <a href="http://wxpack.sourceforge.net">wxPack</a> has not been released yet, but the new version will probably be out soon and no doubt feature <a href="http://www.wxformbuilder.org/">wxFormBuilder v3</a> (the new version of a GUI builder).<br /><br />If you like GUI building in wxWidgets then the 2.7 development codeline actually seems pretty stable from my tests.  If you are currently using 2.6 you are missing out on integrated <a href="http://www.kirix.com/community/wxaui.html">wxAUI</a> (advanced docking and UI kit) and quite a few other improvements.</div>

I can&#8217;t be the only one.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a> has taken off, so I took a closer look at it and realised I have essentially been doing AJAX for years.  I referred to it as XML and Javascript to render a web page (not using XSLT).<br /><br />Maybe I&#8217;ve completely missed the point, but the only difference between what AJAX is now (in simplistic terms) and what I did a while back was the way the XML was being retrieved.  Admittedly my Javascript was way simpler than these new flashy whizz-bang sites, but the same data/view separation was there.  I am pretty sure it was referred to as DHTML (although I think that also encompassed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript">VBScript</a>).<br /><br />I must admit these Javascript platforms are really impressive, especially as the browser support gets better, like with WYSIWYG editors embedded in webpages which is what I am typing this with.  I just realised this post seemed a bit negative, but I think it&#8217;s all FANTASTIC! (Fast Show fans will know what I am on about)</div>

Out of all the GUI toolkits I have been looking at, the <a href="http://www.vcf-online.org">Visual Component Framework (VCF)</a> has impressed me most.  It was easy to compile in Visual C++ Express 2005, but most importantly the resizing is silky smooth (an odd thing to say is important, but it really impressed me).  Most importantly the webpage has a link to <a href="http://www.zod2008.com/">Zod 2008</a>, you know who to vote for!<br /><br />The VCF is an almost cross-platform GUI toolkit, in that the Mac and Linux implementations are not complete yet.  It is based on modern C++ and uses a signals/slots type event system.  What made this so easy to evaluate was that I could load the solution into Visual C++ Express 2005 and kick off a build.  And with my Core 2 Duo upgrade I made recently, it whizzed through the compilation of over 100 projects.  I was using the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> trunk so a couple of the newer examples didn&#8217;t compile, not a problem.<br /><br />It was a bit of a leap for me to try it out as it was well out of the &#8220;similar to MFC&#8221; comfort zone, but getting some code up and running was trivial.  There are so many examples that it can be difficult deciding which example provides the best template for a solution to your design.  There is an online book describing lots of the VCF which although it is not finished is pretty informative, plus the source code documentation is likewise pretty good.<br /><br />I found this a well-designed package as well, as it was not just simply a monolithic library, it was split into components.  This also makes it much easier to implement cross-platform versions of it as there is a porting guide on the <a href="http://vcf-online.org/forums/">forums</a>.  There are some well written extensions as well with the graphics kit using the splendid <a href="http://www.antigrain.com/">Anti-Grain Geometry Library (libAGG)</a>, networking, and so on.<br /><br />I started posting some questions on the forums because from the website and forums it looked a pretty quiet project, but I think it is just a case of appearances being deceiving.  The main developer Jim Crafton (ddiego) drives it on with loads and loads of development.<br /><br />The Windows version of the VCF is definitely mature enough to develop with, and looking at it I am surprised it does not have a more thriving community as it seems to have all the right ingredients.  Some of these things are probably down to luck not judgement I suppose.</div>

A while back I found a really great website for game development libraries.  What I found was that these libraries are useful for development full-stop.  So go check it out at the <a href="http://abattoir.wolfpaw.net/personal/gamelibs.php">Free Game Development Libraries website</a>.<br /><br />If you are interested in programming you will find some libraries you knew about and some that you never knew existed.  Also along with breaking the libraries down by functionality it also specifies the licence type.</div>

I realised the other day how many Google products I was using&#8230;<ul><li>Analytics</li><li>Blogger</li><li>Browser Sync</li><li>Calendar</li><li>Google</li><li>Mail</li><li>Notebook</li><li>Page Creator</li><li>Personalized Homepage</li></ul>Also I use the search and now the code search.<br /><br />And now I have just signed up for:<ul><li>Spreadsheets</li><li>Writely</li></ul>It&#8217;s great all these things are free and freely provided, but now I think I am getting too reliant on it all&#8230;  Admittedly I only use some of the things I am signed up to, and signed up to other things just to try them out.<br /><br />But I wasn&#8217;t going to discuss my addiction to trying things out.  Something occurred to me when I was looking at the new <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Office</a>, browsers are providing all this functionality, but we are still using an ancient paradigm.<br /><br />Microsoft are releasing Internet Explorer 7.0 very soon, and it is attempting to catch up with Firefox by adding features like tabbed browsing, but it is just playing catch-up to an idea that was born before all of the AJAX applications started leaping out of the woodwork.<br /><br />As these AJAX applications become more prevalent the web browser starts to become a hindrance.  Do you use multiple tabs or do you use multiple windows, and how do you arrange and manage those windows (especially since they all have the same taskbar icon)?  Are the bookmark user interfaces moving with the times?  The web browser needs a rethink for these new uses as it is still designed more for viewing static data (and now that is only part of its repetoire, a specialisation of its more generalised use).<br /><br />Most web browsers have their rendering engine a different layer, so that is easy to break out.  Do these applications become a separate window?  Do we get a new kind of application launcher?  I&#8217;ve never really put much thought into it as until recently I never saw the web as a platform.<br /><br />Certainly I am finding the current browser technology very limiting as tabbed browsing, multiple windows, bookmarks are not allowing me to use all of these new applications to their maximum potential.  Just having GMail and Blogger open in web browsers is harder than it should be to manage as I have to do a double take on the task bar or think before switching tabs.<br /><br />Maybe the web browser needs a rethink, or maybe my ideas aren&#8217;t so outlandish&#8230;  The main web browser application is some sort of navigator/task bar and the pages are shown in their own easily recognisable windows, perhaps even without borders as they currently exist.  I suppose some of these ideas are being integrated into these new &#8220;sidebars&#8221; in operating systems, but do they go far enough and take the new AJAX applications into account?</div>

<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> is the 800lb gorilla in the open source GUI toolkit arena.  It goes well beyond being simply about the GUI and spreads into all areas of application development, from networking to database to threading to strings.<br /><br />It isn&#8217;t such a large leap from MFC to wxWidgets.  They are born from the design of macros and simple classes, and this is not as large a problem as sometimes it is made out to be, some people find it easier, some find it harder.<br /><br />By far the easiest way to get up and running is to use <a href="http://wxpack.sourceforge.net/">wxPack</a> if you are using Visual Studio, or give <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org">Code::Blocks</a> a try.<br /><br />The sheer breadth and depth of the project is amazing, and it keeps spreading further with more and more contributions.  What I have noticed over the past year is that it has really started to take off with millions of additions like wxAUI (docking toolkit), wxFlatNoteBook (a tab control window container like Visual Studio has), wxPDFDocument, wxSQLite3, and in the past few days wxSkin (a potential skinning package).  The website is also much better with a <a href="http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/">wiki</a>, a <a href="http://wxforum.shadonet.com/">forum</a>, and this week a <a href="http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.  Google Summer of Code seems to have been a success for wxWidgets as well.<br /><br />I certainly have had some success with it writing a test program embedding an <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org">Ogre</a> rendering context into a docking user interface to try out wxAUI.  It looked impressive although didn&#8217;t accomplish much&#8230;<br /><br />Before making this post too long I will go into more depth in wxWidgets another time.</div>

<a href="http://www.torjo.com/win32gui/">Win32GUI Generics Homepage</a><br /><br />When I found this project I thought I had found the holy grail.  An advanced use of C++ for user interface purposes.  I looked past the screenshots on the website which seemed odd, but downloaded it anyway.  The last release of the project and any active development was nearly a year ago.<br /><br />It certainly pressed all the right buttons for me.  It was a wrapper for the Win32 API with aspirations to be cross-platform.  I encountered my first set of problems when I tried to get it to compile, you shouldn&#8217;t use the solution files for Visual Studio.  There is a &#8220;build library&#8221; utility that works with Visual C++ 8.0.  I got a few examples up and running with minor project file tweaks like include directories, and found that custom draw buttons were not XP themed so I hacked in a small theming API.<br /><br />All seems okay so far.  The biggest problem I found was the resizing, it caused massive amounts of flicker.  Having solved a lot of similar problems in MFC I tried to get it to flicker less with no success.  Then attempting lots of other examples I found they simply crashed or would not compile.  Most disappointing was I could not have a look at the new &#8220;Surfaces&#8221; version of the library.<br /><br />The compiled size of the library is massive with large amounts of global static data.  I found building a bit pot-luck.  I had to configure the Boost Jam files to not use iterator debugging or safe iterators.<br /><br />The thing is I really like this library and it seems really powerful, but simultaneously lacks a little robustness.  There is a lot of work to be done on this library to make it ready for the primetime which is really unfortunate.  John Torjo definitely deserves a pint of beer for fantastic and thought provoking work.<br /><br />There is a great little article about it <a href="http://blog.davber.com/2006/07/10/win32-for-real-c-developers/">here</a>.</div>

At work, I only use MFC and the antiquated design features in Visual Studio for working on resources.  These interfaces still feel like they haven&#8217;t moved on for a lifetime (and are in fact pretty much unchanged from Visual Studio 6.0).<br /><br />The most annoying part about working with the resources is I have to resort to handcoding most of the time.  It is especially necessary in order to follow the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch14e.asp">Official Guidelines for User Interface Developers and Designers</a> (self-inflicted myself, but you need some level of consistency).  Also the IDE design features have an uncanny knack for orphaned <span style="font-style:italic;">#defines</span> and controls.<br /><br />MFC doesn&#8217;t really feel like an API as most of the stuff I want to do I end up having to subclass and write lots of specific code.  There are subclasses for just about every type of control, and in that a lot of it is direct access to the Win32 API.<br /><br />I must admit that I don&#8217;t have an intense hatred for MFC like a lot of developers.  It seems to serve its purpose well, and there are so many extensions and large applications built on it.  I don&#8217;t think Microsoft envisioned being unable to kill it off because it is used by too many applications.  It will still be developed and have some new &#8220;managed&#8221; features which strikes me as odd&#8230;  MFC is a thin wrapper around the Win32 API, but .NET is a wrapper around the Win32 API, so there would be a double level of indirection for these new features.<br /><br />A lot of people would love to migrate away from MFC, but they are too integrally tied into their applications.  The cause of that is normally the initial codebase grew from a small code-generated wizard application.  I know I would love to do move away from MFC, but it is first necessary to find a new GUI toolkit that is capable of doing every feature you have probably handcoded in extensions to MFC, or if you have to write the extensions yourself it is no more difficult to do than the first time you wrote it.<br /><br />That is part of the reason to really look in depth at GUI toolkits.  It is really necessary to find one that will allow the most active development by the virtue of being easy to pick up.  Also, the grass is not always greener on the other side.</div>

It is quite bizarre they have never tried to make any improvements to it ever, even when they deprecate bits it never actually provides a great improvement - it is pretty much the same as when it first appeared.<br /><br />In fact in SP1 Beta of VS2005 they put in some safe library work.  It manages to break MFC to the point of being unusable thanks to making the Recent Files List throwing an exception.</div>

It is unfortunate that Microsoft doesn&#8217;t bother to improve the GUI library in MFC. MFC programmers are forced to use unreliable third party code from forums like CodeProject and CodeGuru.</div>

One of the things I really want to check out over the next few weeks are open-source GUI toolkits.  There are quite a few to choose from and I tend to jump from camp-to-camp on a weekly basis as to which one I find the most interesting.<br /><br />Since I am using Visual C++ 2005 Express, the ones I try out fully will be tested and compiled (if indeed a successful compilation is possible) on that platform.<br /><br />The initial ones I have already had a good go at over the past few weeks are <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a>, <a href="http://www.vcf-online.org">Visual Component Framework (VCF)</a>, and <a href="http://www.torjo.com/win32gui/index.html">Win32GUI Generics</a>.  Some others I have been reading about are <a href="http://smartwin.sourceforge.net/">Smartwin++</a>, <a href="http://upp.sourceforge.net/">Ultimate++</a>, <a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a>, and <a href="http://www.fox-toolkit.org/">FOX</a>.<br /><br />Also I want to write up a bit more of a comprehensive howto on Boost Python, as I quite enjoyed playing around with that.</div>

One more toolkit to check out in your GUI series. The Adobe Open Source libraries <br /><br />http://opensource.adobe.com/<br />http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=132417&ssid=10238<br /><br />They certainly use an overall approach that is different from what I am used to seeing.</div>

In as long as I can remember I have not been impressed with the incremental steps in hardware.  The last time I went <span style="font-style:italic;">&#8220;Ooooooh!&#8221;</span> was when I bought a Voodoo card for 3D graphics (it wasn&#8217;t even integrated into graphics cards at the time) for a Pention 200MMX.  The smoothness and difference in response was amazing.  I suppose the incremental steps all add up and the comparison with a few years ago is noticable, but nothing really blew my socks off.<br /><br />That was until we got a top of the range two processor (each with two cores) Core 2 Duo (Xeon).  Bloody hell, I have never seen such a leap in speed ever!  Operations that took days before now take hours, and even when it is a single process (we work on a full multithreading program) it has a massive performance gain in the order of 50%, and  there are three cores still left idle!<br /><br />I&#8217;ve always bought Athlon processors for my home PC builds mainly because they were cost-effective and powerful.  But I have broken with tradition and picked myself up a Core 2 Duo 6400 processor and a new motherboard (which has both AGP and PCI-Ex slots) from my Athlon XP 3200+.  For general websurfing I don&#8217;t notice any difference until I try to compile something.  I am currently compiling a 114 project solution in Visual Studio in the background whilst I am typing this and it is hammering through and took about five to ten minutes to do(!)<br /><br />All I can say is if you do development the Core 2 Duo processors really make a difference.</div>
