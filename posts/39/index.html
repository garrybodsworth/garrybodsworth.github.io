Vista is released to consumers tomorrow&#8230;<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been using Vista for two months now and it has been nothing but a pain.  It has actually slowed my rate of work by virtue of being slow, unresponsive, and needlessly verbose.<br /><br />Today I ran a <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> script which created some text files.  Now I can&#8217;t get the permissions on the directories will not allow me to remove them, it sends me through numerous UAC dialogs asking for permission and then it throws up an error message with a cryptic hex value.  Even editing file and directory permissions fails to alleviate the problem.<br /><br />It&#8217;s not just a new problem encountered day to day, it is a problem that slows you down.  Installing and executing software is massively slower, I guess due to some security changes.  It is all the small things that add up to a big annoyance as there is not one thing that is excessively bad (although UAC is close to that).<br /><br />The best problem I have on Windows Vista is that I can&#8217;t reboot because it breaks my C++ compilation in Visual Studio 2005.  Sounds mad, but it is completely true, the precompiled header or something causes an internal compiler error when trying an incremental build even just changing a single .CPP file.  Unfortunately I can find no relevant documentation on this problem.</div>

Today I have had the pleasure of working on a 23 inch Apple Cinema display.  It runs at a lovely 1920x1200 resolution - that is a lot of desktop real estate.  The reason I wanted a larger monitor more than a new computer was that I was struggling to use the smaller monitor for all my work.<br /><br />The sacrilege I am bestowing upon this beautiful piece of hardware is that I have to work on Windows (and more specifically the beast that is Vista).  What this showed me is Windows is rubbish for working on large monitors in any meaningful way.<br /><br />The problems?  Simply most software designed for Windows is designed to work in full screen mode (and much of the development tools encourage this).  In most instances this is complete rubbish when you are working on a large monitor.  Even the two monitor configuration encourages you to still work with each screen using full screen apps.<br /><br />The main problem is that the window handling and the taskbar itself just isn&#8217;t up to the job of context switching.  This is partially because MDI interfaces (either traditional or tabbed) are controlled by the application not the OS.  The actual windows are also not broken down into functional elements.  Even editing in Word encourages you to use fullscreen.<br /><br />From the demo I had of Mac OSX it deals with multiple windows much better, also all the time I used Linux (KDE and Gnome) it felt like it was geared for large screen use.  It is partially the reason that <a href="http://www.gimp.org">GIMP</a> works much better on Linux than it does in Windows and people using Windows have immese problems with the UI.<br /><br />If large screen computers somehow become the norm I think that Windows will need to come up with a more intelligent way for the user to use the space.  At the moment the resolutions we have are great, but having a more sharply rendered image is of less benefit than using the extra space more efficiently.</div>

My day job is spent writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing">CAM software</a>.  There is a great little hacking site called <a href="http://www.hackaday.com">Hackaday</a>.  Those two sentences may look completely unrelated but it has some great articles about making your own tools (CNC machines) to do machining.<br /><br />Here is a list of CAM related articles:<br /><a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2006/07/12/how-to-build-your-own-cnc-mill/">How to build your own CNC mill</a><br /><a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2006/11/12/make-a-badass-cnc-mill/">Make a badass CNC mill</a><br /><a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2006/12/08/fab-home/">Fab@Home</a><br /><a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2007/01/01/snowboard-cnc-machine/">Snowboard CNC machine</a><br /><br />Fab@home looks really interesting as it is open-source and it is planned to manufacture itself.</div>

If you find fab@home impressive you might also want to take at look at the RepRap project out of the University of Bath in the UK&#8230;<br /><br />http://reprap.org<br /><br />Their soon-to-be released machine is also open source, has a proper plastics extruder presently qualified for polycapralactone which can make usuable, hard objects.  Whereas the fab@home machine costs $2,400 for parts, the RepRap Darwin is on track to cost no more than $400. <br /><br />A spinoff of the RepRap project, Tommelise, is focussed on the American parts environment and uses somewhat different technology and a different control strategy.  It&#8217;s also an open source specification will let anybody with a few hand tools and primitive woodworking skills bootstrap themselves into 3D fabrication for about $150. Tommelise&#8217;s extruder is qualified for polycapralactone and is presently being qualified as well for both high density polypropylene (HDPE, the stuff your plastic cutting board is made of) and polypropylene (HPP, the stuff your coffee maker and plastic electric kettle is made of).  You can keep an eye on the Tommelise project at&#8230;<br /><br />http://3dReplicators.com<br /><br />Have fun!</div>

Recently there has been a wealth of information about <a href="http://wiki.kde.org/tiki-index.php?page=KDE4">KDE4</a> which is going to be the new version based on <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/whatsnew">Qt4</a> with loads of new technologies.  I thought I&#8217;d put all of the recent good links into one handy place.<br /><br />KDE in Suse Linux 10.2 is reviewed <a href="http://blogbeebe.blogspot.com/2006/12/suse-102-part-3-looking-at-kde.html">here</a>.  It has some really impressive screenshots of version 3.5 which doesn&#8217;t even have the splendid new features.  It features the new start menu type thing called <a href="http://home.kde.org/~binner/kickoff/sneak_preview.html">Kickoff</a>, check out the link to see it animated.<br /><br />Bizarrely what kicked off this wealth of information about the progress of KDE4 was someone making a blog post saying there was no progress and no future progress in desktop Linux.  It was completely misguided, but it started an avalanche waking up a dozing beast, one of the KDE developers made this <a href="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2006/12/website-does-not-make-you-smart.html">post</a>.<br /><br />A list of features targeted at KDE4 can be viewed <a href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2007/01/sneek-preview-of-expected-features-in.html">here</a>.<br /><br />There is an article about the SVG rendering in applications <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1167723426/">here</a>.<br /><br />You can view an article about the KOffice 2.0 technologies <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1168284615/">here</a>.<br /><br />There is now a proper installer for running KDE on Windows seamlessly.  This is detailed in <a href="http://commit-digest.org/issues/2007-01-14/">this article</a>.  Also there is now KDE for Mac (so it integrates properly into OSX and not like those X11 applications).  There is some coverage of this <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1168899755/">here</a>.  Both of these are possible thanks to Qt being GPL on both platforms now at version 4.<br /><br />Finally there is an article about the new <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1169588301/">job progress user interface</a>.  It looks like it could be quite useful.<br /><br />Overall, exciting times are ahead for KDE and the Linux desktop.</div>

Just a short post to add some clarity to my <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/">previous post</a> on the subject of using STLPort with Visual Studio 2005 instead of the Microsoft STL implementation.<br /><br />The code used in my observations is a C++ MFC based application.  The STL used are mainly containers with virtually zero iostreams code (or at least so little it will not change the results).  The container usage are from very large long-lived containers through to many short lived small containers and everything inbetween.  Massive amounts of containers are created throughout the program lifetime.  Luckily most containers are created in thread local storage and gets freed when the thread has done its work.  The thread allocators use the allocator provided in STLPort.<br /><br />The difference in performance is marked for what is essentially lots of insertions into STL containers and lots of reads from them.  When we are talking about a 20% performance gain by using STLPort it is quite scary, but also means switching to Microsoft STL would be unacceptable to users because the slowdown would be so noticeable.</div>

In the <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/01/mac-osx.html">previous post</a> I mentioned <a href="http://www.neooffice.org">NeoOffice</a> - the Mac-based version of <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a>.<br /><br />In the first quarter 2007 there are plans to release version 2.1.  This is going to integrate the changes from OpenOffice 2.0->2.1, which includes new scripting and lots of improvements.  Not only that it will also have support for Office 2007 documents, and execution of VBA scripts in Excel documents.<br /><br />Overall it looks like NeoOffice is pressing ahead with substantial improvements and features.  It&#8217;s good to see that Mac OSX has an accomplished office suite outside of Office for Mac.</div>
