I never knew, but the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/default.aspx">Visual C++ Team has a blog</a>.<br /><br />One post piqued my interest - updates to MFC&#8230;  In the new version of MFC they are planning to allow the use of Vista style file open dialogs.  You can read the post <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2006/12/14/vista-style-file-dialogs-with-mfc.aspx">here</a>.<br /><br />This is good that extra functionality is being added to MFC since so many projects are no doubt saddled with legacy code.  It&#8217;ll make it fairly easy to get an integrated look without too much hassle.  This is apparently available through the Visual Studio Orcas builds.</div>

<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> is a popular development platform, kind of more than an IDE.  It is based solely around plug-ins and provides a good development environment.  At the moment most of its strength is the Java development and its use for embedded systems (see my previous article about SunSPOTs - that used the Eclipse IDE for remote debugging.<br /><br />One of the projects within it I keep an eye on is the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">CDT</a> project which is a plug-in for C/C++ aiming to be as strong as the Java development.  At the moment it is used a lot for the embedded space, but they want to extend it even further and challenge the <br />Visual Studio IDEs.<br /><br />The guy heading up the CDT project Doug Schaefer has been blogging about the progress of the project for a while.  In the CDT 4.0 roadmap the plan is to use the Windows SDK and have integrated debugging and the suchlike.  His most recent post <a href="http://cdtdoug.blogspot.com/2006/12/migrating-from-visualc-to-cdt.html">&#8220;Migrating From Visual C++ to CDT&#8221;</a> shows the progress the project is making.  It is always great to have alternatives and Eclipse certainly could help along that route.  Part of the plan is also to add C# support as well from the Windows SDK.  At the moment I would not recommend using CDT in lieu of VS2005 for Windows application development but if your toolchain is make based you may find this a better alternative.</div>

On the 13th December I attended the <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">Cambridge SPA</a> meeting.  Cambridge SPA is an offshoot (or part of) of the <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">BCS</a> and they hold monthly meetings for varied presentations about lots of aspects of computing.  I decided to throw caution to the wind and see what it was like (after all it was free) and it was hosted at <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge">Microsoft Research Cambridge</a> who generously provided the rooms and laid on a buffet.<br /><br />This presentation was about <a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/">SunSPOTs</a> which are small programmable Java devices.  It is defined as Java On The Metal since there is no operating system and Java does all of the control.  When you tell Java to sleep() the device also sleeps and it is extremely power efficient.  It uses the <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/squawk/squawk-rjvm.html">Squawk Java VM</a> which provides a version of Java ME functionality.  The device also has sensors built in like tilt and light sensors.  It communicates wirelessly or by USB.<br /><br />I got the impression that it still hasn&#8217;t found its true purpose yet, but is proving that Java is a good solution for the embedded environment space.  It also provides much better debugging facilities than traditional embedded environments.  Still, all very interesting.<br /><br />It was most interesting that my old haunt <a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk">Essex University</a> is using these devices.  And it was one of my favourite masters courses that was using it <a href="http://iieg.essex.ac.uk/">The Intelligent Buildings Group</a>.  It was bizarre to hear this since when I read about the presentation initially I thought this would have been ideal for Intelligent Buildings studies at Essex Uni.  When I did my dissertation there I was looking at the TINI Java embedded board for that although it didn&#8217;t amount to a great deal in the end.<br /><br />Still, I had a good time, met some people, got informed about an interesting subject, so all in all it was a good use of an evening.<br /><br />If anyone lives near Cambridge and is interested in computing in general, I can recommend you check it out.</div>

As an FYI, Squawk does not &#8220;provides a cut down version of Java ME functionality&#8221;, it provides full CLDC 1.1 and soon to be IMP 1.0 support.  Squawk is a very lean implementation of Java ME intended for small constrained devices with low memory.  It also runs on the metal, ie does not require an OS, which simplifies its portability and reduces its resource requirements.<br /><br />From the Squawk PI :)</div>

Sometimes at work it just happens you are so under pressure non-stop that any hope for decent practices are out of the window and there is a constant flurry of mounting problems at your doorstep.<br /><br />Joel On Software has a little test to see just how good your work environment is for good coding.  You can see it <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">here</a>.  Go ahead work out where your company lies on the scale, 10 or lower are defined as serious problems.<br /><br />Sometimes these types of problems you can turn around with a bit of hard work.  It is not always possible though - but you have to try.  Joel also has another article about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000332.html">Getting Things Done When You Are A Grunt</a>.  This suggests it is possible to improve standards even if you are not overly experienced or not very high up.  You can also view the related discussion <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=2033">here</a>.<br /><br />It is easy for the process to overtake the coding though - and you must always keep that in check somehow when you open this Pandora&#8217;s Box - or you can spend your entire time only on that.  This isn&#8217;t good for you and not good for your colleagues.  I think if you work at a 0 rated place then it must be simple to get a few points added to the rating.</div>

On the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com">CodeProject</a> there are a couple more articles about using the Vista Native API, which is actually accessing the base API through C++, bypassing the need for .NET.<br /><br />The first article is <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/vista/VGFileDialogs.asp">Using the New Vista File Dialogs</a>.  This is actually written with <a href="http://wtl.sourceforge.net/">WTL</a> in mind, but the ideas are the same whatever you are using, so long as you can access the API.  So you can now add the new Vista file dialogs to your current programs.<br /><br />The second article is <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/vista/VGTaskDialog.asp">Showing Friendly Messages with Task Dialogs</a>.  This exposes the new TaskDialog API which Microsoft want people to use for displaying information to users.  It&#8217;s all fairly simple, so it is extra Vista in your program for not too much effort.</div>

Microsoft have released XNA Game Studio Express 1.0.  This is a platform for developing  managed DirectX applications targeted at PCs and X-Box 360s.  The development environment is based on the Visual C# Express edition that Microsoft released earlier this year.  <br /><br />In order to develop for the X-Box 360 you have to join the <a href="http://msdn.com/xna/creator">Creators&#8217;s Club</a> at $100 per year.  You are not allowed to use it for commercial development on the X-Box 360, but you can for targeting Windows.  For commercial development on X-Box 360 there will be an XNA Professional version released some point next year.<br /><br />Currently Windows Vista and Server 2003 are unsupported, but then again Visual Studio 2005 is unsupported on Vista so it is no surprise.<br /><br />Certainly the quality of Microsoft&#8217;s development tools is pretty good of late, and they are giving a lot of applications away.  All of the Express Editions of the Visual Studio.NET are definitely worth checking out for development and provide a fast way to get up and running.</div>

The latest version of <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> has been released.  This is now version 2.1 with a host of new features.  You can see all the release notes <a href="http://development.openoffice.org/releases/2.1.0.html">here</a>.<br /><br />The main thrust of this version is to help push the <a href="http://extensions.openoffice.org/">extension technologies</a> (which originally appeared in 2.0.4).  They are trying to encourage the same level of extensions as with Firefox, whether this succeeds or not only time will tell.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve used OpenOffice.org since the betas of version 2 and it has always been solid and consistent, and I never fell into the trap I did with Microsoft Office where page formatting could change randomly.  The features of OpenOffice are more than adequate for all the uses that I have had for it (and it has meant that I don&#8217;t have to buy an MS Office licence).  I&#8217;ve used it for generating PDFs for printing magazines and it does the job fantastically.</div>

I&#8217;ve been racking my brains recently about triangle meshes and curvature.  The problem with triangle meshes is that they don&#8217;t really want to have decent normals defined for them, especially if your triangles have inflections between them from the generation.<br /><br />Someone who is much better than me at geometry pointed me at a really good article about normals and curvature from arbitrary meshes.  The article is <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/gfx/pubs/_2004_ECA/index.php">Estimating Curvatures and Their Derivatives on Triangle Meshes</a>.<br /><br />There are implementations of the ideas in the article in <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/gfx/proj/trimesh2/">trimesh2</a>.  It&#8217;s worthwhile taking a look at the source code (it&#8217;s in C/C++) and is fairly self-explanatory if not optimal.<br /><br />Calculating the normal on an arbitrary mesh is fairly simple if you don&#8217;t want to be accurate in the slightest.  Just take the average of the triangles that share the point.  This works fairly well if your triangles do not have inflections and they are divided into separate surfaces (or faces depending on your terminology).  The idea behind this paper is to look at regions of points and to get the average of these, but weight them for their distance from the point you are attempting to calculate.<br /><br />If you store this data it is only a one time calculation hit, so it will not slow down your program.  This type of calculation is perfect for 3D rendering, although I need to see the overall quality in order to determine if it can be used for applications requiring more accurate results like CAD/CAM.</div>

Sun have <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/">released Java SE 6</a> the latest version of Java for use in developing desktop and server applications.  This isn&#8217;t the GPLed version just yet as the development of version 6 just missed the boat.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.netbeans.org/products/">NetBeans is also available</a> as a free IDE for development.  It is an excellent quality IDE which now has a <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/products/cplusplus/">C/C++ plug-in</a>.  The C/C++ plugin is a bit new so it is not perfect by any means, but has just as much potential as the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">Eclipse CDT</a> project.<br /><br />I am going to try out more Java programming to see how far the GUI was away from looking platform native.  Hopefully, it is not too far away right now.</div>
