<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stepanov">Alexander Stepanov</a> (the brains behind the C++ Standard Library) has just posted the latest draft of the first five chapters of his upcoming book &#8220;Foundations Of Programming&#8221; which is co-authored by Paul McJones. You can view the PDF <a href="http://www.stepanovpapers.com/eop/eop.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>He currently works at Adobe and has a remit for providing the formalisation of generic programming techniques. This work also provides the basis for the <a href="http://stlab.adobe.com/">Adobe ASL</a> open-source C++ libraries.</p>

<p>At the <a href="http://accu.org">ACCU</a> Conference earlier this year I attended the the Adobe ASL talks hosted by Sean Parent, where he said about giving Stepanov the job of formalising the ideas behind generic programming. You can read my write-up of the talk <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2008/04/accu-2008-conference.html">here</a>. I found the talk eye opening and interesting and the ideas behind the approach give them a very solid foundation for reusable components.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I like features that make code more concise, manageable and expressive.</p>

<p>I was writing some code in Python that was essentially a function dispatcher where all the functions have the same arguments. When writing them in a more static language you have to specify all the arguments wherever they are forwarded when what you really want to say is take all the arguments and bung them into the next function. Not really a problem with cut and paste, but when you start changing the function protoype you have to make sure you change it in all the related places.</p>

<p>In Python you have the option of using *args which consumes the rest of the arguments of a function and puts them into a list. This meant that I could define lots of the functions which were just forwarding using *args and then pass them into the function being forwarded to using *args.</p>

<p>You can write:<br/>
`</p>

<pre>
foo1('yes', True, 100, 3.14, 'hello world')
def foo1(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5):
    foo2(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5)
def foo2(*args):
    foo3(*args)
def foo3(param1, *args):
    print param1
def foo4(param2, param3, param4, param5):
    print '%s %s %s %s' % (param2, param3, param4, param5)
</pre>


<p><p>`<br/>
foo1() is the long winded way to write it. foo2() just forwards all of the arguments. foo3() takes the first parameter (and prints it) and forwards the four remaining parameters. foo4() finally just prints out the four remaining parameters.</p>

<p>Anyway, the reason I liked it was it removed the horrific evolution overhead of rapidly developing some code. When I wanted to add/remove/consolidate parameters in the code for a lot of related functions using *args made it much simpler to do. You don&#8217;t have to settle for a little less perfect solution because making a minor adjustment is a large amount of work.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>There is a good post called <a href="http://blog.ibeentoubuntu.com/2008/08/appliancising-of-free-software.html">The &#8220;Appliancising&#8221; of Free Software</a> which talks about how free software is helping to make appliances of computing equipment and the diversification of the &#8220;standard&#8221; software. Perhaps not the best description but the post itself brought up some interesting points.</p>

<p>The way I see it is that the loudest complainers (who probably don&#8217;t even use free software) complain that there is too much choice in free software. Basically when you create a computer &#8220;appliance&#8221; you would use some custom software set up especially for that device. It is likely you would start with something like Debian or Gentoo and then customise it for your own needs.</p>

<p>Even writing commercial software the same thing occurs. I have seen the same product rebranded for not only different markets but for different resellers and agents. Then they all want their own customisations to differentiate from what is essentially the same software.</p>

<p>Doing the same type of thing with Windows is just insane. For a start you can&#8217;t really configure the system without undocumented things and jumping through many hoops, even Media Centers are pretty much equivalent editions possibly with some changed logo graphics with only the hardware providing the differentiating factor.</p>

<p>Also doing the same thing from scratch is brain-damaged. Reinventing the wheel for little or no benefit will just lead to maintenance headaches. As a developer I am fundamentally lazy and will reuse what I can because it is great to stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to this future of diversity because one-size-fits-all doesn&#8217;t work and could supply better to tested and built systems that actually do what they say.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>So I&#8217;ve been writing in Python as part of my job for a month now&#8230; I am still writing using a text editor and running stuff on the command line (after dabbling in Eclipse and other Python editors). I can see why people like Python so much, it has some cool stuff.</p>

<p>What I discovered this week was the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-Queue.html">Queue</a> object in Python. It is a thread-safe FIFO queue and it is there and ready to use. In C++ I would probably have found the definitive implementation through some library (hopefully in <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a>) or I would have to roll my own with all the headaches involved in making sure just the building blocks work correctly. I&#8217;m not using it in the way that most people would expect but that is the great part of supplying solidly tested building blocks.</p>

<p>As usual the code I am writing needed unit-testing to make sure it did what it says on the tin. This meant a multi-threaded unit-test &#8211; I know this is a <a href="http://goodliffe.blogspot.com/2008/06/unit-testing-threads-is-hard-part-4.html">bad thing sometimes</a>. I had to thrash it with the mountain of threads but the tests seem to work consistently (although I imagine it could turn up to bite me in the future). I am sure three-quarters of the code I have been writing are unit tests.</p>

<p>Some other great parts of Python I found is the function is a first class object, and I&#8217;ve even played a little with lambdas. I&#8217;m looking forward to investigating where the best place is to put the boundaries between C++ and Python code.</p>

<p>At the moment I am really at the tip of the iceberg stage, there is the 75% that isn&#8217;t so obviously on display.</p>
