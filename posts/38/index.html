The best freely available installer program I have found is <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a>.  NSIS2 is obviously the most popular and well known but when I was investigating both systems I found NSIS2 unwieldy and the scripting not very intuitive.  When I saw the Inno Setup scripting it just made sense, the language design is around installing programs and files.  It solves a very domain specific problem.<br /><br />The installers look great on whatever Windows version you run them on and there has been recent work on Vista compatibility.  The installers generated are really quite compact and in comparison to most MSI installers I have run it is substantially faster.  Also it is capable of 32 and 64 bit installers.<br /><br />What makes it even better is it comes with a great GUI frontend called ISTool.  It provides a GUI for all elements available and has excellent built-in help using tooltips.<br /><br />Inno Setup comes with a comprehensive set of translations and also provides non-supported translations on the website.  So if your program is available internationally it is an easy feather in your cap.<br /><br />Inno Setup is the simplest to use and the fastest to get up and running.  You can knock up an installer in minutes without the need for consulting large manuals, I had my first test installer created from scratch in under ten minutes, so I imagine anyone can do it.</div>

A new distribution on the block is <a href="http://www.sabayonlinux.org/">Sabayon Linux</a>.  I don&#8217;t normally make a habit of talking about Linux distributions, but I found it quite interesting.<br /><br />Sabayon is based on Gentoo, the infamous source-based Linux distribution.  What makes it interesting is it is a <a href="http://dot.kde.org">KDE</a> distribution with <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/02/beryl-020-preview.html">Beryl</a> installed by default.  This gives lots of eye candy.<br /><br />It is a live CD/DVD which means you can try it out with no risk, but also it provides the facilities to install to the hard drive.  This is much like most modern Linux distributions (like Ubuntu).<br /><br />The whole design looks really quite good with transparent menu bars and a unified theme throughout.  You can see some screenshots <a href="http://shots.osdir.com/slideshows/slideshow.php?release=758&slide=16&title=sabayonlinux+3.2+screenshots/">here</a> and <a href="http://shots.linuxquestions.org/?linux_distribution_sm=SabayonLinux%203.25">here</a>.<br /><br />What I also noticed from the screenshots is that they are using <a href="http://home.kde.org/~binner/kickoff/sneak_preview.html">Kickoff</a> for the main program navigation.  I mentioned it previously <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/01/kde-happenings-and-version-4.html">here</a>.  It fits in really nicely with all of the work that has obviously been lavished on the UI.  Unfortunately it looks like the default theme is trying to make the window borders look like Windows Vista.<br /><br />And finally the point of this post is there is a nice review of this distribution by <a href="http://www.linuxtechdaily.com/2007/02/review-sabayon-linux/">Linux Tech Daily here</a>.</div>

Way back in November I made a post about <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/11/more-vista-menus.html">menus on Windows Vista</a>.  Essentially it came down to the fact that custom drawing did not draw menu items correctly, and even Windows Explorer on Vista had the same rendering problems.<br /><br />There is a <a href="http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2007/02/06/Vista-Style-Menus_2C00_-Part-1-_2D00_-Adding-icons-to-standard-menus.aspx">post on Shell Blog about Vista style menus</a> which starts a series about getting the menus to render correctly.  The first part provides a solution for those people that want icons next to the menu items where custom drawing previously provided the solution.  The most useful bit is there is a small bit of code to convert the HICON to a HBITMAP which is the main stumbling block for people trying to make the transition.<br /><br />You will notice the difference in style once the custom drawing is removed and it will look much more integrated.</div>

There is a nice long preview of <a href="http://www.beryl-project.org/">Beryl</a> 0.2.0 you can <a href="http://lunapark6.com/?p=2916">read here</a>.<br /><br />Beryl is a 3D compositing engine for Linux desktops.  It can use 3D acceleration and provides lots of nice effects, including the new ones available in Windows Vista.  There are lots of screenshots there showing the features running on Kubuntu.  It probably isn&#8217;t as polished (yet) as the commercial offerings but it is not like Windows Vista demanding a substantially more powerful computer in order to see these effects.<br /><br />Even at the end of the article there is a nice walkthrough on how to install the package.</div>

Nope, I haven&#8217;t forgot how to type, but it is a new Java Library for game development.  It provides access to <a href="http://www.openal.org">OpenAL</a> and <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> through Java.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lwjgl.org/">LWJGL</a> is designed to allow commercial quality game development in Java and represents many years of development.  It&#8217;s not a game engine in itself but provides the framework to develop them easily on Java.  It is designed to work on anything with a JVM so it could be used in smartphones and the like.<br /><br />It&#8217;s interesting from the point of view that this would enable cross-platform development and hopefully give a platform like DirectX.</div>

The past week I have been compiling a list of free (open-source and closed-source) games available for Windows/Mac/Linux.  It is amazing how much there is out there, so I&#8217;ll probably have to divide it up into multiple posts.<br /><br />There are lots of good quality open-source projects, which makes for lots of source code to eyeball which is really quite cool.<br /><br />But before I start down that road, there is a great blog called <a href="http://indygamer.blogspot.com/">Independent Gaming</a> which has great indy, freeware and open-source games.  The coverage is really comprehensive an has plenty of great reviews.</div>

With my problems with Vista I have to wonder when the world will grind to a halt.  I realise it is a very pessimistic view and I know it won&#8217;t happen, because it will probably just cause more hardware churn (the buying of new hardware).  Those that know what they are doing with computers though will still plough their own furrow with well designed solutions.<br /><br />The problem I am getting to though is Visual Studio 2005.  Initially we were really impressed with it, you can look inside of arrays and it allowed settings to be exported and automated.  Unfortunately months down the line I think it must suffer from digital entropy.  The .vssettings files seem to rarely work now even though there is nothing to suggest why the settings will not take.  The bscmake.exe continually fails, sometimes with an out of memory exception.  The incremental linking can sometimes  take over 20 minutes for a simple one file change.  The STL is simply too slow if you rely on the speed of the STL operation.  The Intellisense update can cause the UI to freeze up and it rarely builds the symbols correctly meaning you can be left with no tooltips.  VS2005 uses masses more memory and gradually slows down.<br /><br />The thing was when we installed it, there was definitely a lot of bonuses, but after having to use it for a few months it becomes incredibly difficult to defend it.  I think the IDE is now geared towards CLI/.NET development so it probably works seamlessly for that, but for C++ only it seems to be lacking and going backwards in some instances by forcing some &#8220;secure&#8221; programming on you.<br /><br />Unfortunately it is still the best IDE for developing on Windows and there is very little to touch it.  Maybe in the future something like <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org">Code::Blocks</a> or <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> could catch it, but it will probably always be ahead.</div>

<a href="http://www.cegui.org.uk">CEGUI or Crazy Eddie&#8217;s GUI System</a> is not a typical GUI toolkit.  It is designed primarily for gamers to embed a GUI interface into graphics windows (normally in order to use this they would be fullscreen or you would use the platform toolkit).<br /><br />The GUI toolkit itself has backends for DirectX 8.1 & 9, <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a>, <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">OGRE</a> and <a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/">Irrlicht</a>.  This allows you to then overlay GUI elements into your program window.  The advantage of being self-rendering is that it is then cross platform.  Currently it supports Linux and Windows and Mac OSX support is on its way.  The nature of the renderer backend means it would be trivial to use it in something like <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org">OpenSceneGraph</a>.<br /><br />With the theming ability of the engine it is possible to use this toolkit as your start screen menus for games or even more.<br /><br />The toolkit itself is written in object-oriented C++ and looks really quite clean from the examples.  For its niche it really doesn&#8217;t have masses of competition, but it does not preclude it from being and impressive solution.</div>
