<div class="post-content"><p>For a couple of weeks I have been playing around with Qt and GTK+ at fairly low levels, attempting to get some low level pixels and other things.</p>

<p>What I discovered on these travels is that Qt is much faster to get up and running (with a simpler build system that works more or less straight away) whereas GTK+ is much more difficult to get started with (unless you are using the packages supplied with your distro).</p>

<p>Then it swings back the other way because with Qt you have less access to the low level functionality or those types of interfaces that are exposed are not quite powerful enough. With GTK+ it certainly seems a bit more configurable in that respect, say for writing a new backend.</p>

<p>A good piece of news about GTK+ is that there is now a native OSX version <a href="http://www.gtk-osx.org/">GTK+OSX</a>.</p>

<p>Also, an enterprising developer has created a new indirect rendering backend with no reliance on an X-server (very handy for testing and the suchlike) which can be found <a href="http://nanosleep.org/wiki/GTK%2B_Indirect_Renderer">here</a>. The GTK Indirect Renderer sends the pixels to a Cairo surface so you can wrap them round strange OpenGL things or put them in SDL.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Sometimes programming makes you feel like you are losing your marbles. Over the past few days I have lost many hours of my spare time attempting to compile a branch of GTK+.</p>

<p>I went down the obvious route of installing the development libraries with apt-get and then attempting to compile the source code. That, needless to say did not work at all.</p>

<p>Next up I tried the suggested method of jhbuild, the package available in the Ubuntu repositories. I just ended up with multiple versions of glib all conflicting with one another.</p>

<p>Next up I tried building jhbuild from its source. Building jhbuild was pretty simple, and then I tried to bootstrap and compile GTK+. The pain then came that hidden deep within the logs it wasn&#8217;t installing the version of Cairo necessary for Pango, so I attempted to find my way around that which meant I ended up in library hell. It was so damn close though as it was only GTK+ left to build and there was a compilation error because something was missing from Glib to do with emblems &#8211; so close and yet so far. It seems to you need some libraries installed on your system as well as the ones that are constructed as part of jhbuild.</p>

<p>I persevered with lots of combinations, time and hard work, and still I didn&#8217;t manage to get it to compile. It&#8217;s a bit depressing to be defeated by a build system, but it seems to have grown so massive and baroque that it is a large barrier to entry. The thing was I really wanted to mess around with one of the git branches of GTK+.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I think I have mentioned before the merge hell you can hit in <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> like other source control systems. What you really need in that instance is a good merge tool to make it easy. When I used <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> on Windows I used <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/">KDiff3</a> which did most merges automatically and made three-way merges pretty painless.</p>

<p>With Git on OSX the default mergetool is the built in file diff, which is pretty useless when it comes to merge hell.</p>

<p>I followed the KDiff3 integration article <a href="http://notch8.com/articles/2008/06/06/kdiff3-git-win">here</a> but there is some kind of bug in KDiff3 that means that it does not save the files correctly even if you set up the merge manually.</p>

<p>However, there is good news with <a href="http://blog.logicalrand.com/2008/9/9/use-p4merge-or-diffmerge-with-git-mergetool-on-os-x">this logical.rand article</a> which shows you how to integrate <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/">Diffmerge</a> or <a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/products/merge.html">p4merge</a>. Both of these tools are very polished on the Mac and means merge hell manages to become much more manageable.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Reading Code</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s not something like being able to crank out a million lines of code in a year, or to construct the most complex algorithms. Being able to read and comprehend other people&#8217;s code is the most important skill you could need.</p>

<p>Very rarely do programmers get to work in a bubble where they only have their own code to deal with, and most have to work on a legacy system of some sort. In such an environment you need to be able to understand the code in order to simply fix bugs, let alone being able to evolve and add features to the system and codebase.</p>

<p>It also segues nicely into another bugbear of mine, Not-Invented-Here Syndrome. NIH is really a side-effect of being afraid of other people&#8217;s code, but when you have the ability to read a wide variety of code, bug fixing in those external areas isn&#8217;t so frightening. The benefits definitely outweigh the risks of using externally developed code thanks to it typically having many man-years of development being invested in it, leading to a maturity that would be very difficult to reach when starting from scratch (unless the quality was so bad there is no choice). Stand on the shoulders of giants &#8211; it helps.</p>

<p>Another nice side-effect is it helps you respect other people&#8217;s perspective. All those things that annoy you about understanding other people&#8217;s code, remember them and filter them out in your own code. It will mean other people can use your code more effectively. Consistent formatting (I don&#8217;t care where stuff goes so long as it is sane and consistent &#8211; things like braces in C/C++), easy debugging, useful documentation, reusable functionality, and easy testing, should always be aimed for when creating code. It&#8217;s even best to think that way in private pieces of code because you never know when it will end up being public.</p>

<p>The new features for version 2.0 include 64-bit guest support, native OSX user interface, a Qt4 interface, and even a Python programming interface (on Linux and Solaris currently). This release seems a good step forward for the Mac version, so I can play around with VMs on my home computer without needing to spend money on Parallels.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>A few months back 280 North released an online presentation presentation tool called <a href="http://280slides.com/">280 Slides</a>. The most impressive aspect of which was the user interface that mimicked a full desktop application in look and feel. At the time they promised that the framework used for this (written in Javascript) was going to be released under an open-source licence.</p>

<p><a href="http://cappuccino.org/discuss/2008/09/04/announcing-cappuccino/">Objective-J and Cappuccino</a> have now been released under the LGPL licence. The Cappuccino website is <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">here</a> with lots of information and documentation.</p>

<p>The framework itself is really designed for writing proper applications in the web browser like GMail and 280 Slides rather than simply adding interactivity to web pages. Objective-J provides the basis of the &#8220;language&#8221; adding more features to Javascript non-invasively, then Cappuccino is built on top of it and is more or less a port of the GNUStep/Cocoa frameworks.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see other applications written with these technologies and to see how the way applications in the web browser could change with it. If you look at 280 Slides it is really impressive and now I have tried it in Firefox 3.0 it is really quite snappy (when I tried it a while back in Firefox 2.0 it was a bit more sluggish). This also becomes even more interesting with the new Javascript advancements being made by various browsers like TraceMonkey (Firefox 3.1), SquirrelFish (Safari 4.0), and <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/v8/">V8</a> (Google&#8217;s Chrome).</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>The coverage around Google Chrome hasn&#8217;t died down very much since its release, which is interesting in itself, but the coverage is starting to get more technical and taking it apart.</p>

<p>The post <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/code-reuse-in-google-chrome-browser/">&#8220;Code Reuse in Google Chrome Browser&#8221;</a> looks at al the external libraries used in Google Chrome. Apart from the obvious libraries WebKit and the new Javascript engine V8, there are some more interesting ones. Apparently it uses <a href="http://wtl.sourceforge.net/">WTL</a> for the GUI, which was a Microsoft originated GUI toolkit (with lots of excellent extensions) that ended up becoming open-source. It&#8217;s a very good toolkit for windows and developing for it is relatively painless but it is an interesting choice. Also there is Skia which is a vector graphics engine that is used for the rendering, apparently from an acquisition a few years back.</p>

<p>Alp Toker has blogged a little more in-depth about <a href="http://www.atoker.com/blog/2008/09/06/skia-graphics-library-in-chrome-first-impressions/">&#8220;Skia graphics library in Chrome: First impressions&#8221;</a> with some interesting insights along with some code.</p>

<p>Wired Magazine also have an article <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/16-10/mf_chrome?currentPage=all">&#8220;Inside Chrome: The Secret Project to Crush IE and Remake the Web&#8221;</a> proving that the PR and technical launch have been very successful.</p>
