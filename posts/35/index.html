One of the most overlooked programs out there is GCC - <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">The Gnu Compiler Collection</a> - a vast array of development tools that are truly free to use unencumbered.<br /><br />It provides a suite of compilers from Fortran, to Java, to C++.<br /><br />At the moment for Windows unless you use Cygwin (not recommended) you will be using <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a> which is currently at version 3.4.5, some way behind the version available on Unix systems (which is in 4.2 prerelease).  The good news is that once gcc 4.2 is released it will be released for MinGW, which should mean lots of good improvements, from standards compliance to OpenMP to speed ups from new optimisations.<br /><br />Obviously it does not only target specific OSes, but it also targets different platforms including 64-bit.<br /><br />Admittedly it is not as fast the the Microsoft compilers, but maybe it will get there.  One worry is that Microsoft will lose interest in their compilers for native code as they go further and further down the .NET route.</div>

<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2127458,00.asp">Sun announced the open-source Java Development Kit</a> recently.  It&#8217;s under the GPLv2 license and it looks like they want to capture the open-source community.<br /><br />This could be a really interesting period since Java may start to gain even more traction as more people become involved in its development.  Hopefully meaning slicker VMs being released.<br /><br />OpenBSD are currently merging this <a href="http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20070508192340">release into their codebase</a>.  I imagine others will not be far behind.  I hope it means that it becomes well supported on many platforms.<br /><br />You can see the OpenJDK website <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">here</a>.</div>

Went to another talk from the <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">BCS SPA Cambridge group</a>.  There is a talk every month and they are normally well worth attending, there is certainly nothing else I have found like it elsewhere.  As usual they are hosted at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/cambridge/">Microsoft Research, Cambridge</a> with a buffet.<br /><br />This month&#8217;s talk was about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMMI">CMMI</a> hosted by  Kieran Doyle of Lamri.  I must admit I had no idea what CMMI was before going to this talk, only what it was an acronym for.  For the first half of the talk I had no idea what was going on as it covered the history of it, and did not explain what it actually was.<br /><br />Eventually we got onto the nitty gritty of this thing was.  I&#8217;d have to see what the benefits were in reality but the premise of itself is admirable, especially in a larger corporation.  Overall, I actually learnt something that is a plus, and also the at the talk we got free 512Mb USB keys - not half bad.<br /><br />Anyone interested in computing in the Cambridge area should check out these talks.</div>

An interesting new blog is out there about physics-based animation.  You can go and read it <a href="http://animationphysics.wordpress.com/">here</a>.<br /><br />It is mainly from a gaming perspective but I think that most of the theory can be applied to engineering as well.  A lot of great theory comes out of the gaming arena and they certainly share ideas a lot more than the engineering arena.</div>

I think that part of the theory coming from this is that it is thought about from a practical real-world use standpoint.  It is always possible to come up with the ideal solution but I would say it very rarely works in the real world without an extremely small problem domain.</div>

Well, to be fair it&#8217;s really coming more from an academic computer graphics and film/visual effects standpoint, since a lot of the stuff there isn&#8217;t really fast enough to be incorporated into real-time games (though might be soon, with GPU&#8217;s going the way they are). But I definitely agree with your point about theory coming out of the graphics world; there&#8217;s a lot of smart people in graphics these days, and I think it&#8217;s more and more plausible that some of what gets developed will feed back into the computational mechanics and fluid dynamics communities.</div>

A new version of the <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/">Adobe ASL</a> open-source GUI library came out on the 3rd May.  The releases of this library seem to be steaming ahead at a monthly rate.

<a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> is a cross-platform make system that seems to be gaining a large following.  It is simple to write the make definitions and the program can create platform specific builds including Visual Studio.NET project and solution files.  There is a nice Wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake">here</a>.<br /><br />Recently KDE successfully <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/188693/">transitioned to the new build system</a> relatively painlessly, when the previous system was essentially unmaintainable.<br /><br />It provides support even for <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a> - the Simple Wrapper Interface Generator.  Which is interesting from a library standpoint.<br /><br />There are hooks for testing regimes available from the main website.<br /><br />Admittedly from the Visual Studio viewpoint it would probably be a hard sell to others.  The main problem I have with Visual Studio is that it screws with the vcproj files massively on seemingly innocuous edits.  At least then you have complete control of your build environment without worrying everything getting altered due to GUI edits.</div>

Dell has <a href="http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid39_gci1253364,00.html">officially announced</a> they will be making Linux based computers.<br /><br />Dell are going to offer certain computers with the option of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) as the pre-installed OS.  This is a good thing because it will at least guarantee the hardware and support of those platforms will be well catered for in the Linux environment.<br /><br />All in all this is a good thing, and I hope it spurs other computer makers into the same area.</div>

This is a GUI toolkit that I had never heard of or seen until yesterday.<br /><br /><a href="http://notus.sourceforge.net/">Notus</a> is a GUI toolkit based on the ideas of generic C++ programming, according to the website it is an attempt to create a domain model.<br /><br />It hasn&#8217;t been developed for a very long time now (over a year) according to the website but looking at the CVS logs there were changes six months ago to the source code.<br /><br />It is by no means a finished article but it has some interesting ideas (although it looks like it could e incredibly complicated thanks to lots of templates).  It is not as comprehensive as the other library that uses the same concepts <a href="http://www.torjo.com/win32gui/">Win32 GUI Generics</a>.<br /><br />The demos are quite simple and a few years out of date, but it seems to at least work.  It is a shame that none of the Boost-ified GUI libraries seem to have caught on, or at least been carried on.</div>

Recently public betas for the next version of Visual Studio.NET Orcas (v9.0) were made available.  It is possible to get hold of the free Express versions.<br /><br />You can download Visual C++ Orcas <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/future/visualc/default.aspx">here</a>.  And all the other Express versions can be accessed <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/future/">here</a>.<br /><br />The C++ compiler with Orcas is a bug fix of the one available with v8.0 (fixing over 180 bugs).

Even though Windows Vista has been out a few months the myth that OpenGL is being degraded is still being perpetuated.  Even though it was debunked what seems like at least a year ago the story just seems to have legs.<br /><br />Anyway to re-emphasise that all is well in the land of OpenGL they have promoted the article about <a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/article/vol003_9/">OpenGL on Vista to their frontpage</a>.  Obviously support is still not as robust as the XP implementation, but then again most drivers are lacking at the moment (due to the recency of the release).</div>
