After an extended summer break the <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">SPA Cambridge talks</a> are back.  A change of venue to Anglia Ruskin University has now happened which is much better due to close vicinity to many pubs which was a problem with the Microsoft Research venue.  Thee events are organised by Mark Dalgarno and you can <a href="http://blog.software-acumen.com/">read his blog here</a>.<br /><br />This month&#8217;s talk was about Test Driven Development by Ivan Moore.  It was an interactive session requiring a laptop and Eclipse.  Unfortunately I discovered I must have the only copy of Eclipse in existence not set up for Java development (I have used it for Python and C/C++) a bit too late to rectify that.<br /><br />The exercise was to solve a blocks world problem with test driven development.  We used Java and JMock for this.  I also got to show my Java ineptitude since I haven&#8217;t used it for 7 years properly, so I was learning on the fly.  To be honest now I go back to Java it is a lot more inelegant than I remember.  At least after all that I managed to get the tests to pass&#8230;<br /><br />The interactive sessions are a bit more fun when you are sharing a computer, especially when all three of us huddled around it have very little practical Java experience.<br /><br />The next <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">talk will be from Ian Griffiths about WPF</a> (Windows Presentation Foundation) on the 14th November.</div>

Two weeks ago I attended the latest <a href="http://www.accu.org/index.php/accu_branches/accu_cambridge">ACCU Cambridge meeting</a> called Closing The Case For Groovy presented by Russel Winder.  It was very kindly hosted by <a href="http://www.displaylink.com/">Displaylink</a> again.<br /><br />This talk was about dynamic languages concentrating mainly on <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>.  It is a dynamic language which is compiled into JVM bytecode meaning it can interact very nicely with Java.  What was particularly refreshing about his talk was Russel not talking about language wars but how they can cooperate together.  Overall the talk was entertaining and informative especially from the point of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)">Closures</a> which I really needed to learn about.<br /><br />Obviously the pub visit afterwards was essential.<br /><br />The next talk will be on Thursday 1st November by Allan Kelly.  If you like technology and development and live in or around Cambridge then these talks are essential.</div>

It&#8217;s amazing how many mistakes it is possible to make when attempting to understand a concept.  Up until a couple of weeks ago I had some misconceptions about virtualisation.  I&#8217;ve used it through VMWare and have viewed it as a way to have a virtual layer on top of your processor.<br /><br />Then some concepts coalesced from various articles I was reading.<br /><br />Virtualisation is the abstraction of resources away from their use.  At the moment the most common use of virtualisation would be memory.  You get a virtual address space from your operating system - this can be mad up of RAM, ROM, cache, hard drive, flash memory, and probably more.  You don&#8217;t know what you are accessing but the virtualisation of those resources and their access makes it easy to use.<br /><br />One of the catalysts for my understanding was iD Software new iD Tech 5.  There was mention of Megtexture which was texture virtualisation allowing the use of massive amounts of textures for the rendering.  This would no doubt be a way of not needing to know about the basic building blocks of the textures, but to use them through a virtualised interface.<br /><br />Then this comes to the processor virtualisation.  My misconception was because of the examples I had seen from Parallels and VMWare.  It allows you to run multiple computers on a single processor.  But what processor virtualisation should do is abstract away the processor resources allowing the program to run.  This would mean that you would not care about multiple cores or even computers, you could in their run one virtual machine which has a backend of a massive cluster of computers.  I don&#8217;t know if this is the case yet as when you do parallel processing you still nee to know too much about the parallelism in order to develop a solution but I imagine some solutions must be able to do it.</div>

This is a sad thing to get me excited but Microsoft seems to have been keeping something up its sleeve for Visual Studio 2008.  Normally nothing is a surprise with Microsoft and I had assumed that we had seen all we would from VS2008 in the latest beta.<br /><br />As it turns out they have a massive update for MFC dropping for Visual Studio 2008.  It had been alluded to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/08/08/visual-c-futures.aspx">here</a> and <a href="http://herbsutter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212D4327CC297151BB%21278.entry">by Herb Sutter here</a>.  I assumed that we would have to wait for the version after VS2008 since the beta was largely the same as VS2005.<br /><br />At Technet 2007 in Spain there is a talk:<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Title/Code: TLA404 MFC Updates for Visual Studio 2008 and Beyond  <br /><br />Presenter: Ale Contenti  <br /><br />Abstract: This session will demonstrate the new features added to MFC in Visual Studio 2008, including support for Vista Common Dialogs, Vista Common Controls, the Microsoft Office 2007 Look and Feel (including support for an Office Ribbon style interface), Office and Visual Studio style Docking Toolbars and Tabbed Documents. We will also talk about our plans to evolve the MFC library for Visual C++ 10 and beyond. This is an in-depth session designed for experienced C++/MFC programmers. (C)   <br /></span><br /><br />Do a search for the speaker <a href="http://www.mseventseurope.com/OnlinePub/Public/sessions.aspx?EventId=HbLEvtKcPE4%3d">here</a>.<br /><br />So it looks like the people using MFC will be getting some very powerful UI features as standard.  I&#8217;m not so bothered about Vista standard controls but more powerful docking would be very nice and would go hand in hand with tabbed document interfaces.  The most exciting part is the Office 2007 look &#8216;n&#8217; feel along with the ribbon user interface (is it RibbonBar? I don&#8217;t know&#8230;).  I guess we will find out more in November but this is good news for people maintaining MFC systems.</div>

I mentioned a couple of posts back that I was going to put some thought into GUI subjects and maybe trying out writing a simple toolkit.<br /><br />I was thinking abut which way to jump with trying to write a toolkit.  First of all what should it be based on?  Should it just wrap Win32?  Cocoa?  Should it be entirely implemented on top of OpenGL from scratch?  Should it be cross-platform in design?  Just these questions could cause anyone to run away screaming.<br /><br />Thinking about building it on top of OpenGL I encountered a couple of interesting GUI libraries <a href="http://glui.sourceforge.net/">GLUI</a> and <a href="http://glow.sourceforge.net/">GLOW</a>.  In these projects the windows are completely rendered by OpenGL which is an interesting approach.  I suppose <a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/">Juce</a> is built from similar roots as well where it implements its own toolkits.<br /><br />I was thinking about writing a nice C++ wrapper for Win32 but then I started to think even Microsoft products don&#8217;t use the standard widget rendering.  Then you start to think about built in custom drawn widget rendering, then you think why are you using standard widgets&#8230;<br /><br />The whole idea about implementing a simple GUI toolkit is an education about the design decisions and pitfalls that you can get into.  You also need to decide which subset you decide to implement first.  The problem is most toolkits go for the same 10% and that is normally as far as they get.<br /><br />The main idea I want to try out for an experimental GUI toolkit is some DSL (domain specific language).  What I mean is embedding a language in C++ in order to implement the user interface in a readable fashion.  It is certainly possible using modern C++ idioms as demonstrated in Boost.  I suppose the type of thing I want to do is (in some kid of C++ like pseudo code):<br /><pre><br />dialog(...) +<br />widget<static>("Number", sizeX, sizeY) | widget<edit>(RESIZE_X) ||<br />widget<static>("Name", sizeX, sizeY)   | widget<edit>(RESIZE_X) ||<br />widget<list>("Blah", sizeX, sizeY, RESIZE_XY)<br />;<br />toolbar() +<br />button("image1", ...) |<br />button("image2", ...) |<br />separator() |<br />button("image3", ...) |<br />button("image4", ...)<br />;<br /></pre><br />Complete and utter insanity?  Probably, but could be fun to try out.  It would certainly be something different and would create a parallel in your source in comparison to what you would see on screen.  I don&#8217;t think anything quit like it has been tried before, so feel free to steal the idea - it would save me implementing it(!)<br /><br />Enough rambling for today I think&#8230;</div>

It&#8217;s hard to believe this blog has been going for one year as of today.  I can&#8217;t believe I actually remembered this since I never managed to spot my 100th or 200th post.<br /><br />It has been quite a year really.  NC Graphics were taken over by PTC meaning I am now with a third employer working on the same codebase (in four separate stints).<br /><br />Certainly the most popular items on the blog have been the <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/07/tortoisesvn-and-visual-studio.html">TortoiseSVN and Visual Studio integration</a> and recently the <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/08/debugging-stlport-in-visual-studio.html">STLPort debugging in Visual Studio</a>.  Thanks to all the readers and all the comments.<br /><br />I would promise something for the next year or some manifesto, but if it is as action packed as the previous year I somehow doubt I will live up to it.  All I can promise is  if I learn anything interesting about computers I will share it with the rest of the Internet.<br /><br />Normal service will now resume.</div>

Visual Studio 2005 provides a very decent IDE to work with (if you overlook the crashing and disappearing into black holes).  There hasn&#8217;t been much focus on the native C++ side of the IDE for a while, which means it does lack some useful features.<br /><br />One of those tools available for free on the internet is <a href="http://www.cupla.net/CodeWiz2/">CodeWiz2</a> providing a number of very quick and simple additions to the IDE which makes coding a bit easier.  Friend File lets you switch between header and implementation and Friend Member lets you switch between declaration and definition for a single function.  I did have a script that did it, but this works much better (and will at least work on Vista as well since the Macro Explorer was broken last time I tried).<br /><br />It is also scriptable in a manner of speaking meaning you can get common code structures or comments at the tap of a button.  Oh yeah, did I mention it is free?<br /><br />Another free tool available for Visual C++ is <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/RefactorCPP/">Refactor!</a> which you will be surprised to hear offers refactoring for C++.  Only the simplest functionality is available in the free version but it is quite interesting.  I tend to refactor by hand myself, but one useful side-effect of this plug-in is when it highlights all instances of a variable which helps make the code a bit easier to navigate (and should really be a basic feature of the IDE).</div>

I have been doing this blog nearly a year now and certainly in 2007 I have neglected GUI coverage.  The main problem is that there hasn&#8217;t been a huge amount of impressive work on the open-source front and those libraries that showed the most promise are languishing in Sourceforge hell.<br /><br />Maybe Winforms has caught on big-style?  Maybe, but as far as I can tell when you get down to the OS level it still amounts to Win32 function calls, it is just the framework is built on top of that.  Also, many more applications can now be run as web-based applications, with its own plethora of GUI toolkits.<br /><br />Qt is obviously the leader but is only open-source for open-source applications unfortunately (and quite rightly as they do deserve to make money off it).  wxWidgets is not making as massive strides as many would have hoped in order to have really good looking native Windows applications.  The most recent substantial addition was wxAUI that added lots of good stuff like docking.  None of the ideas floating around Boost got off the ground unfortunately, and Win32GUI Generics and Notus and many others are mothballed.  Maybe there needs to be a &#8220;State Of The GUI Union&#8221; post&#8230;<br /><br />I am thinking of doing a small GUI toolkit just to test out the theories and get a better appreciation of the difficulties involved in design and implementation.  It would also mean I could play around with some of my memory allocation and multithreading ideas as part of it.  I&#8217;ve been trying to pull together as much information about Win32 as posible and I&#8217;ll definitely put them all together in one article.</div>

It&#8217;s hard to believe it is nearly October.  The bad part is getting older, the better part though is that the ACCU talk is coming up.  See the website <a href="http://www.accu.org/index.php/accu_branches/accu_cambridge">here</a>.<br /><br />This month is about dynamic languages and is called <span style="font-weight:bold;">&#8220;Closing the Case for Groovy (and Ruby, and Python)&#8221;</span> by <a href="http://www.russel.org.uk/">Russel Winder</a>.  And apparently there will be a related <a href="http://www.pythonforrookies.org/">book</a> that may or may not be out in time for it.<br /><br />Hopefully the week after will have the first <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SPACambridgeEveningMeetingProgramme">BCS SPA Cambridge</a> meeting since the summer as well.</div>

This month&#8217;s ACCU Cambridge &#8220;The Missing Link&#8221; talk was held at the <a href="http://www.displaylink.com/">DisplayLink</a> offices on the 6th of September.  Presenting the talk was Peter Smith who is part of the linker team at <a href="http://www.arm.com/">ARM</a>.<br /><br />The Missing Link talk was about the role of the linker in software development.  The talk detailed the history, the design of, and the use of linkers.  The talk was about an hour long but could easily have gone on longer.  Certainly from the tak I got the impression that the linker is a rather unloved part of the compilation process.  In fact there is really only one book about linkers called &#8220;Linkers and Loaders&#8221; which is available online from <a href="http://www.iecc.com/linker/">this link</a>.<br /><br />The talk itself was entertaining and was at a suitably high level for everyone to understand.   The actual architecture of compilation and linking really has not changed to much throughout its history.  Some of the more interesting parts of the talk were the discussions about name mangling and the reasoning behind it, and the caveats that need to be implemented to get around things like templates in C++.<br /><br />I think there is a plan for the slides to be available online via the <a href="http://www.accu.org">ACCU website</a>.<br /><br />As always though after the event you can learn lots more by going to the pub. A good turnout for the pub was the icing on the cake.<br /><br />The next talk will be about dynamic languages and will be held on the 4th October.  Keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.accu.org/index.php/accu_branches/accu_cambridge"></a>.</div>
