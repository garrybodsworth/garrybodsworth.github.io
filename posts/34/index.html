A couple of recent articles on the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com">CodeProject</a> cover the porting of applications to 64-bit.  It does mention the datatype problem where the size changes.<br /><br />The first one is <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/Test_64-bit_applications.asp">Problems Of Testing 64-bit Applications</a>.  The second is <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/20ISSUES64BIT.asp">20 issues of porting C++ code on the 64-bit platform</a>.<br /><br />The second one is the more comprehensive and provides practical solutions to the problem.</div>

The latest version of the <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> Library has been released.  This is version 1.34 and you can read the changes on the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost frontpage</a>.<br /><br />Boost is a fantastic peer reviewed library collection for C++.  It adds power and robustness for C++ programmers, after all we shouldn&#8217;t need to reinvent the wheel all of the time.<br /><br />There are five new libraries:<br />     * Foreach Library:<br />         BOOST_FOREACH macro for easily iterating over the elements of a<br />         sequence, from Eric Niebler.<br />     * Statechart Library:<br />         Arbitrarily complex finite state machines can be implemented in<br />         easily readable and maintainable C++ code, from Andreas Huber.<br />     * TR1 Library:<br />         An implementation of the C++ Technical Report on Standard Library<br />         Extensions, from John Maddock.<br />         This library does not itself implement the TR1 components, rather<br />         it&#8217;s a thin wrapper that will include your standard library&#8217;s TR1<br />         implementation (if it has one), otherwise it will include the Boost<br />         Library equivalents, and import them into namespace std::tr1. Highlights<br />         include: Reference Wrappers, Smart Pointers, result_of,<br />         Function Object Binders, Polymorphic function wrappers, Type Traits,<br />         Random Number Generators and Distributions, Tuples, Fixed Size Array,<br />         Hash Function Objects, Regular Expressions and<br />         Complex Number Additional Algorithms.<br />     * Typeof Library:<br />         Typeof operator emulation, from Arkadiy Vertleyb and Peder Holt.<br />     * Xpressive Library:<br />         Regular expressions that can be written as strings or as expression<br />         templates, and that can refer to each other and themselves recursively<br />         with the power of context-free grammars, from Eric Niebler. <br /><br />Obviously lots of the other libraries have been updated like Boost::Python.</div>

Part of the reason blogging has been so light in recent months is that work has been taking up more time than usual.  Now at least it is official.<br /><br />The company I work for, <a href="http://www.ncgraphics.net">NC Graphics</a> has been acquired by <a href="http://www.ptc.com">PTC (Parametric Technology Corporation)</a>.  You can see the press release <a href="http://www.ptc.com/appserver/wcms/standards/textsub.jsp?&im_dbkey=51168&icg_dbkey=21">here</a> and some additional information is available <a href="http://www.ptc.com/company/ncgraphics/index.htm">here</a>.<br /><br />Obviously it is all only of interest if you know me, but at least it will explain what I am doing when I change my blog summary.  Fingers crossed it will be a good move.  This has all been very tightly kept under wraps so it probably surprises quite a few people.  It has been surprising that noone in this entire period has asked me about it since CAM really is quite a small industry.<br /><br />And on a related note - Julian Todd and Martin Dunschen are ex-NC Graphics employees with a CAM blog linked to on the side panel to your right.</div>

<a href="http://wxformbuilder.org">wxFormBuilder</a> is a RAD designer for <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a>.  It is free and open-source.  It is in the beta phase of version 3.0 and is also supplied as part of <a href="http://wxpack.sourceforge.net/">wxPack</a>.<br /><br />wxFormBuilder is easy to use, simple to look at, and provides a very decent set of features.  It is a standalone system that is simultaneously good and bad, goosd that it requires nothing else, bad because some people require IDE integration.  You can output the designs to XRC (the XML based resource language for wxWidgets) or to native C++.<br /><br />You can see some screenshots of version 3.0 <a href="http://wxformbuilder.org/?page_id=38">here</a>.  The screenshots so some fairly interesting and complex designs demonstrating some of the power of the system.<br /><br />You can see their roadmap for features <a href="http://issues.wxformbuilder.org/?do=roadmap&project=1">here</a>.  They use <a href="http://flyspray.org/">flyspray</a> for their bugtracker (which is a good system).<br /><br />What is particularly nice about this program is the amount of GUI widgets it supports including the contributed ones like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxflatnotebook">wxFlatNoteBook</a>.  I thin it supports enough to create a very good GUI visually.</div>

I believe knowledge wants to be free, it never thrives when it is being stifled by secrecy.  I am an idealist in that regard although I am willing to admit I fail to do enough about it (hopefully I will get around to changing that).<br /><br />My TortoiseSVN integration into Visual Studio is out there because I wanted people to not go through what I did to get it up and running.  Because the project that makes it possible is open-source, there is no reason I should keep something so trivial secret that makes it more useful.<br /><br />It seems that the war is about to begin.  Microsoft have declared that <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/">free software violates 235 of their software patents</a>.  Microsoft are not specific beyond application areas like office applications or email.  The article itself is deliberately inflammatory, especially the choice of pictures and captions.<br /><br />This article is merely a couple of days after <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/090507_Database/09May2007_data05.php">this article</a> in which Microsoft declares that fee software does not exist.  In fact Bill Hilf (of Microsoft&#8217;s Linux Lab) is so wide of the mark it is not funny.  He seems to equate people having jobs means that free software does not exist, and goes so far to say that there is no community when Microsoft are masters at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturfing</a>.   For a start it is Open-Source software and free as in libre software, it is about <span style="font-weight:bold;">knowledge being free</span>, not about the cost being nothing.  Sharing knowledge surely makes a better society.<br /><br />In fact Microsoft are deliberately framing the debate mainly focussing on trying to term it all &#8220;free software&#8221; and trying to make it mean what they say it means.  Microsoft are trying to create a public awareness of people sharing knowledge to create better software being a bad thing by making it sound like it does not really exist and is a corporate conspiracy.<br /><br />Microsoft are treading dangerous ground now because they are going to start alienating people.  Most importantly they will alienate some areas of the development community, I know I have no interest in contributing to anything Microsoft will do, and I plan to steer clear of things like .NET for philosophical reasons.  I started to use VS2005 Express because it is free, but all home development I do from now on will be using non-MS tools (hopefully GCC 4.2 will be out soon).<br /><br />All of this does prove that the doomsayers from the Novell-Microsoft agreement were right on the money.<br /><br />Eben Moglen ( former general counsel to the Free Software Foundation) has given an <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39287036,00.htm">interview here</a>.  He has been instrumental in getting GPLv3 together.  There is an interesting article about <a href="http://www.itmanagersjournal.com/feature/23144">misconceptions about the GPLv3 licence here</a>.  Alex Cox, one of the instrumental developers on Linux has also <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/05/10/223693/linux-guru-backs-new-gnu-licence.htm">given his backing to GPLv3</a>.<br /><br />In almost unrelated news Intel have released <a href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=117876282007989&w=2">more open-source graphic drivers</a>.  Also AMD/ATi have committed to <a href="http://enterpriselinuxlog.blogs.techtarget.com/2007/05/09/amd-will-deliver-open-graphics-drivers/">releasing open-source drivers</a>.</div>

My favourite bugtracker <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/releases/3.0/">Bugzilla has just released version 3.0</a>.<br /><br />New features include custom fields, an XML-RPC interface, per-project permissions, better UTF-8 support and much more.<br /><br />I think the reason that I like Bugzilla so much is that it is a developer&#8217;s bugtracker.  it is not the prettiest or simplest of the bugtrackers out there, but it has masses of useful features and is very configurable.  It really does make a developer&#8217;s life easier since I find it more centred around getting the bugs done and dusted rather than attempting to make it look nice for non-techies.</div>

One of the things we pride ourself with at work is well written code.  In a previous post I have mentioned the code review (also known as peer review) process, but we also use <a href="http://www.gimpel.com/">Lint by Gimpel Software</a> for static C++ code analysis.<br /><br />There was a new article about <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/Test_64-bit_applications.asp">The Problems of Testing 64-bit Applications</a> which is interesting from the point of view that it approaches the problem from a code correctness viewpoint.<br /><br />At the end of the article there is a good selection of links to interesting software, papers and theories.</div>

Here is an interesting <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/06/Cpp/">article about C++ in Visual Studio Orcas</a>.  I get the feeling of deja vu from reading something similar&#8230;<br /><br />Anyway some of the C++ stuff&#8230;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Vista styles support.</span>  Lots of work has been done on MFC to make it use the Vista common controls like file open dialogs and the rest.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">New common controls.</span>  New common controls are available like a split button and network addresses and more.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Resource editor.</span>  It has been sorely in need of some work in recent releases and it looks like it will finally have support for 32bit colour images.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">User Access Control.</span>  Some built in support for UAC through the manifests and the suchlike.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Compile in parallel.</span>  The parallel compilation will be ramped up to allow faster builds, which is always useful.</div>

The first <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1178891375/">alpha release of KDE</a> 4.0 has <a href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/visualguide-4.0-alpha1.php">just been released</a>.  Exciting times are certainly ahead for this desktop environment.<br /><br />At the link you&#8217;ll see some pictures, which are not radically different but do contain the spiffy new Oxygen icon set.  There are improvements to the backend including being based on the latest <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">Qt</a>, and multimedia and hardware support through projects like <a href="http://phonon.kde.org/">Phonon</a> and <a href="http://solid.kde.org/">Solid</a>.<br /><br />The release is expected in October 2007.  Most of the work looks like it will start to concentrate on bringing the apps and the look up to scratch.<br /><br />They are also asking for help to make sure the apps follow the Human Interface Guidelines <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1178743323/">here</a>.</div>
