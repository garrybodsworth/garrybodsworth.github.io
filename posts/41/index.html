Nope, this isn&#8217;t a post moaning about Vista&#8230;<br /><br />A senior Microsoft Corp executive is worried items he terms as &#8220;craplets&#8221; could damage the perception of Microsoft Vista.  These things he is referring to are the &#8220;added value&#8221; programs that OEMs add to their specific version of the operating system above and beyond what Microsoft supply.  These are the programs like DVD writers and other icons cluttering your new computer&#8217;s desktop that are unnecessary and usually completely rubbish and destructive.<br /><br />You can read the article <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/10/tech-microsoft.html">here</a>.<br /><br />It&#8217;s good to see someone might improve the situation as I spent some of yesterday on a new computer just do uninstalls of tens of programs on a brand new Dell.  These programs were not needed and basically served as adverts.  Also you have to remove the links to various ISPs and the suchlike that you would never switch to.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think this will fix the situation though and perhaps just make the problems more uniform, or they are the same problems with a stamp of approval from Microsoft.  If possible you should always try to get hold of a Windows disc that is Microsoft vanilla and use that for reinstalls.  But beware - you must get the right one for your registration key as there are two types of disc - the OEM and the commercial - and the keys are not interchangeable.  I found this out when finishing a reinstall it would not accept a key as it was an OEM key and it wanted a shop bought one.</div>

When I installed Windows MCE Edition I updated everything to what Windows Update offered.  This included Windows Media Player 11.  When I tried to run media centre it played nothing, not even TV.  Luckily I blamed WMP11 before anything else.<br /><br />I went in search of codecs.<br /><br />I found one particular codec pack that did the job and allows me to play DVDs and everything in my video and music folders, even spotting dolby digital.  This codec pack is The <a href="http://www.cole2k.net">Cole2K Codec Pack</a>.  A simple installer takes all the thought out of doing it which makes it even better.<br /><br />Other ones I found which I didn&#8217;t use are:<br /><a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm">K-Lite Codec Packs</a><br /><a href="http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic=66826">Advanced Vista Codec Pack</a><br /><br />So if you are having problems with video or music playback in Windows try one of these packages and it should ease all your worries.</div>

I&#8217;ve now finally got around to installing Windows MCE on my media centre after fooling around with <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/">Media Portal</a> as my media centre software.<br /><br />My media centre is based on a cheap AOpen XC-Cube with a cheapo Sempron 2600+.  Amazingly it works pretty well the only problem being the transition animations are not too smooth occasionally when running at the highest possible resolution (1280x1024x32bpp).<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been quite impressed with the software.  It is much smoother to set up then the open-source ones I have used in the past, but I don&#8217;t particularly want to use something because it is the path of least resistance.<br /><br />In general the smooth set up and the smooth operation has been better than I expected.  It now works much better with the MCE infra-red keyboard and control, the stand-by operation is much smoother and wake-up ability much better.  Maybe the drivers installed for MCE since it does not necessarily use the same drivers as XP Home/Pro make it more stable?<br /><br />Still after installing it you have to download one round of updates, then 78 updates, then another 13 (at least).  That takes ages - yawn.<br /><br />I&#8217;m actually quite impressed by the associated operating system - it is XP with a lick of paint and extra features.  I have no idea why Microsoft didn&#8217;t use it as an opportunity to release a new version of the OS at the consumer level since MCE is only really for manufacturers.  All manufacturers seem to be using MCE ahead of XP Home anyway now.<br /><br />Overall it has been a very good experience and my wife is finding it easy to use, that is always a good yardstick.</div>

The new <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone">Apple iPhone</a> website has gone live.  This website details the new Apple device designed to be your phone, your music player, your camera, your life&#8230;<br /><br />The tech specs are:<ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Screen size</span> - 3.5 inches</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Screen resolution</span> - 320 by 480 at 160 ppi</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Input method</span> - Multi-touch</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Operating system</span> - OS X</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Storage</span> - 4GB or 8GB</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">GSM</span> - Quad-band (MHz: 850, 900, 1800, 1900)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wireless data</span> - Wi-Fi (802.11b/g) + EDGE + Bluetooth 2.0</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Camera</span> - 2.0 megapixels</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Battery</span>  </li><ul><li>Up to 5 hours Talk / Video / Browsing</li></ul><ul><li>Up to 16 hours Audio playback</li></ul></ul>The reason this device is not your average phone is it runs OS X.  There had been recent rumblings that Apple were going to have an embedded version of OS X and this is it.  It looks fantastic, I just hope it runs as well as it looks.  Being OS X you get Safari as your web browser, you can use desktop widgets, and it all looks great.  Hopefully this also means that developers can really go to town, with the benefit of Apple&#8217;s APIs and also being able to do cross-platform development.  Hell, this version of OS X even still supports multitasking.<br /><br />The interface has a keyboard and &#8220;multi-touch&#8221; the touchscreen user interface that is supposed to be really quite impressive.<br /><br />Enough drooling for today I think.</div>

After a nice vacation I think it is time to get back to blogging.  I managed to completely miss I posted my 100th entry last year as well.<br /><br />For this year though, looking ahead&#8230;<br /><br />More on my journey through the land on Windows Vista.  Much more on GUI toolkits.  An updated Subversion toolbar for Visual Studio 2005.  More open-source software that catches my fancy.  One of the things I&#8217;d like to look at more closely is KDE4 because there has been a flurry of recent information.  Hopefully, providing my wife will let me, I&#8217;ll be getting a new Mac, so hopefully I can wax lyrical about some splendid Apple products.<br /><br />There is probably loads more I can&#8217;t think of thanks to having a break from computers, but I will be aiming to keep up the post a day average.</div>

I was thinking about multiple cores, like you do.  One thing that most people haven&#8217;t realise is that they have been using multiple CPUs for years, one has been your CPU and the other is the GPU - your graphics card.  The graphics card is a very specialised computational unit, but it was added in order to offload processing from your main processor to something else to allow the processor to not get bogged down with graphics processing.<br /><br />Now with the advent of dual core machines and the upcoming (or released in small quantities) quad core machines, a lot of users will probably not know they are using only a fraction of their processing power most of the time.  Maybe it is time for the GPU to become one of those cores on the CPU?<br /><br />At the moment the most likely use for multiple CPUs on Windows is one core to run your antivirus and your antispyware software and the rest you can use normally&#8230;  At least that is what an article I read said multiple cores would be used for when they come out.<br /><br />As the programmable GPUs start to become more common in the next generation of graphics cards they are becoming more and more like a general CPU, so it must be possible for the CPU with multiple cores to have a core or two behave more like a GPU?  Certainly when the 8 core processors come out it would probably be quite nice to use multiple cores as the &#8220;graphics card&#8221;.<br /><br />I imagine though that there are people in labs much smarter than me already working on something like that or better.  It&#8217;s nearly 2007 after all and we are living in the future (well at least it sounds like the future to me) but we still have all of these different things cobbled together making up the current PCs.  It would be sort of nice to see lots of processing converge onto the single multiple core chip as now they are more than capable of doing the tasks whereas ten years ago we still had a processor that was only capable of multitasking in a single core.</div>

One of the biggest headaches in CAD/CAM is file formats.  In fact it is a complete nightmare.<br /><br />Every product out there tends to have its own proprietary format and they normally contain deliberate gotchas and obfuscation to try and prevent reverse engineering the formats.  Also if they provide a DLL to read the format they will deliberate hobble it as well as making sure you have signed some sort of EULA agreement.  That is if you can get to an agreement as if they know you have signed up with another competitor to read their format they might not be so forthcoming with their own.<br /><br />All in all it is the dinosaur&#8217;s way of doing things, especially in the day and age of open formats for things like Office Suites.<br /><br />There are open formats, and most CAD packages allow you to export your data in one of these defined formats.  But they rarely follow the formats correctly and throw away lots of information that would otherwise be useful, so you really want to use the original data.  The most annoying part is having to extrapolate the intentional and unintentional errors that deviate from the specification.<br /><br />Normally you will have to either reverse engineer the format yourself, manage to get a deal with the vendor of the product you want to be compatible with, or find someone who supplies the reverse engineering service as a library you can integrate.<br /><br />It would be so nice if there was a format that could be used for interoperability, but I think most companies like tying people down to their programs and it would require a sea change like what happened with OpenOffice and the Open Document Format (ODF).</div>

Testing is probably the first thing to go in commercial development as a preventative measure since it adds to development time and also adds to the cost of development.  Lots of companies do testing at a later stage like QA or beta testing, but it would be nice to iron out more kinks before we get to that stage, after all it is much more different to retrofit the fixes rather than designing the functionality correctly.<br /><br />One of the preventative ways of testing is unit testing.  This is a great way to stop regressions of behaviour as well as ensuring correct code.  Hopefully this would allow the developers to create well tested bulletproof base libraries that support the entire system with well documented behaviour.<br /><br />There is a great article you should check out reviewing unit testing frameworks : <a href="http://www.gamesfromwithin.com/articles/0412/000061.html">go read it here</a>.</div>

The WPF team has just blogged about a new feature in WPF which is 2D controls on a 3D surface.  Unfortunately the mapping happens within a standard window frame.
