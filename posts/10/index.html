<div class="post-content"><p>It&#8217;s nearly that time of month again (Is it really 2009? Is it really February?) for a <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">BCS SPA Computing Talk</a>. This month the talk will be about Agile.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/APracticalGuidetoWorkingwithCustomersonAgileProjects">Programmers are from Mars, Customers are from Venus: A Practical Guide to Working with Customers on Agile Projects </a><br/>
<a href="http://www.martinitconsulting.com/agile/home.html">Angela Martin</a></p>

<p><strong>February 11th 2009, 7:00pm (light buffet) 7:30pm (talk)</strong><br/>
Venue: <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge">Microsoft Research Centre Cambridge</a></p>

<p>Customers have one of the most complex and difficult roles on a project, yet XP and Scrum include very few practices that support the Customer in their role. Over the last five years, we have investigated many projects around the world to identify how Customers succeed in this complex and difficult task — discovering not what people think should have happened, but what really happened and what actually worked! By the end of this talk you will have gained:</p>

<ul>
<li>A realistic understanding of the complexity and difficulty of the Customer role.</li>
<li>An understanding of the key roles required on the Customer team, both what they are and why they matter.</li>
<li>An understanding of the eight practices that enable Customers to sustainably drive Agile projects to successful completion.</li>
</ul>

<p>On <a href="http://www.yes-no-cancel.co.uk/2009/02/05/camcow-cambridge-coworking-update/">this post</a> are his slides for a presentation he made yesterday for <a href="http://cambridgecoworking.pbwiki.com/">CamCow</a>.</p>

<p>This looks like an absolutely brilliant thing, so if any of you people working in isolation at home in Cambridge and yearn for human interaction this is for you.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>A little while ago I <a href="http://blog.programmerslog.com/?p=274">posted</a> about having problems getting my nVidia GeForce 6600GT AGP working on Ubuntu. I tried everything that a sane person would and then some. I tried Nouveau, Ubuntu&#8217;s various versions in their repository, and the ones direct from nVidia. The closest I had to working was the beta 1.80 which kept crashing&#8230; When 1.80 was officially released I tried that and that did not work at all with a completely black screen (like the other official version I tried).</p>

<p>Anyway, my solution was to order from Play an <a href="http://www.play.com/PC/PCs/4-/7871884/Play-Value-ATI-Radeon-HD-2600-Pro-512MB-PCI-E-Graphics-Card/Product.html?cm_mmc=Froogle-_-PC-_-Components-_-Play%2BValue%2BATI%2BRadeon%2BHD%2B2600%2BPro%2B%2F%2B512MB%2B%2F%2BPCI-E%2B%2F%2BGraphics%2BCard&amp;source=5066&amp;engine=froogle_pc&amp;keyword=Play+Value+ATI+Radeon+HD+2600+Pro+%2F+512MB+%2F+PCI-E+%2F+Graphics+Card">ATi HD2600 Pro</a> for £30. It&#8217;s even got 512Meg on board which is a huge amount of memory. The main reason for this was an eye on the future for proper open-source support, that although is not currently comprehensive will improve in the future.</p>

<p>So I plugged the card in after cleaning out all remnants of all nVidia drivers, rebooted and it worked straight away. I enabled the closed-source ATi drivers and got all eye candy working as well. Ultimately I will use the RadeonHD driver that is open source in XOrg repositories, but it isn&#8217;t quite complete. You can also keep track of available features in a handy table <a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now I am happily able to use Ubuntu at 1920&#215;1200 with useful 3D features like Expose and desktop expose.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing around with the EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) <a href="http://code.staikos.net/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=webkit;a=shortlog;h=kenneth/efl-port">port of WebKit</a> and I have been very impressed by the quality of the page rendering. In fact I have been playing around with Enlightenment E17 libraries, although I haven&#8217;t gone the whole hog and installed the desktop environment.</p>

<p>The quality of the building blocks that have been put together are extremely impressive with multiple rendering backends for the Evas canvas including X11, OpenGL, Windows and Quartz. It&#8217;s a highly optimised canvas to build UIs with. I&#8217;ve spent some time reading the source to work out how it all fits together. I liked the &#8220;buffer&#8221; backend for Evas that allows you to render to that engine and capture the output as a buffer of bytes, but in order to use it there was no massive difference in code.</p>

<p>But I digress, on my travels through the internet I found a few interesting projects related to Enlightenment e17.</p>

<p>First up there is a comprehensive skin for the Enlightenment areas that require it. It is called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/detour/">Detour (DTR)</a> and looks clean and consistent.</p>

<p>Next up I found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/itask-module/">iTask</a> (and its relations iTask-NG and WinList-NG) which are new taskbars for Enlightenment. These look good and provide integration with compositing with the NG versions.</p>

<p>Finally, the best thing I found was someone had put e17 together with the compositing of Compiz called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/itask-module/wiki/Stuff">ecomorph</a>. This is an alpha project but is showing some impressive results. There is a three part video : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHbQ0ASlzCQ">one</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G9hr-izzn4">two</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21VURWljN4A">three</a>. Also you can see a super dark demo <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5gDEiJpBwI">here</a>.</p>

<p>Enlightenment has not been at the forefront unfortunately because of a lack of official e17 release, but hopefully that will be rectified in the near future, mainly because a lot of the framework provided could be really useful (and it is a British thing to root for the underdog).</p>

<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.whitix.org/">Whitix</a> is a new desktop operating system that has just released a <a href="http://www.whitix.org/news/?p=23">0.2 version</a>. I hadn&#8217;t heard of it until today but it is interesting to see a few other operating systems out there.</p>

<p>It is aimed more at desktop users rather than techies as an ultimate goal. Still, it is early days and requires hacking abilities to be able to use it.</p>

<p>Essentially it is a new kernel written in C with some libraries ported to it to provide other functionality. The kernel itself is based mainly on Unix ideas but has decided to move some bits around to be more intuitive (like /usr/bin/ and the suchlike).</p>

<p>The graphics are based on <a href="http://alperakcan.org/?open=projects&amp;project=xynth">xynth</a>. The <a href="http://www.whitix.org/screenshots/">screenshots</a> look pretty good.</p>

<p>Obviously, it&#8217;s early days for the Whitix project but it should be interesting to see what it offers in the long term and how it differentiates itself as it matures.</p>
