There is an interesting <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html">article here</a> about the design architecture for GUIs.  This applies more to the rich clients with database backends, but I think it is more than relevant for designing an application as it would be able to scale in the future much more easily.<br /><br />The obvious subject it covers is MVC (Model-View-Controller).  The article is kept fairly up to date as well with an update the middle of this year.</div>

This week I have been a bit light on the blogging.  The main reason for this is that I was away in Germany with work.  A little show called <a href="http://www.euromold.com/english/">EuroMold</a>, it is the biggest CAD/CAM/CAE (and more engineering type stuff) show in Europe, so all the vendors are there demonstrating and giving away free stuff.<br /><br />I saw the guys behind <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk">FreeSteel</a>, who have put together their own set of algorithms (with the main one being Adaptive Clearing) which they own and licence to anyone who wants to use them for a very reasonable price.  Julian has put <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/?p=115">his write-up of EuroMold on his blog</a>.<br /><br />What you tend to notice about the engineering software industry, is that noone seems to excel, and it is very insular.  Companies don&#8217;t talk to eachother, developers don&#8217;t talk to eachother (even though there isn&#8217;t a huge number of CAM developers in the world), there are no libraries out there that really help when it comes to developing CAM software when it comes down to the nitty gritty of machining.<br /><br />What I noticed about the software on display at EuroMold, is it all looked mostly the same. The OpenGL rendering looked excellent on some packages but the rest of the user interface was poor in comparison.  Also some tended to make the same mistakes in the user interface (as the default behaviour of code generators tends to leave some holes).  Most demonstrations were done with the standard Windows theme so it all looked like the 1990s running on Windows 95&#8230;  A bit of a pity since I have sent a couple of weeks tweaking <a href="http://www.ncgraphics.co.uk/">DEPOCAM</a> for Windows Vista, so it looks good on that platform.<br /><br />With most of the applications, they are getting more and more functionality, and doing more and more in one place.  This tends to make for cluttered applications.</div>

Joel On Software has an interesting little post <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/29.html">about source control</a> and how Microsoft does it (specifically with the Vista codebase).<br /><br />You can see how it can all get out of control, and how it is easy to find yourself stuck as part of a process that doesn&#8217;t scale, and how this can adversely effect an entire project.  It also shows a lack of modularity since other projects of a large size do not necessarily have similar problems.</div>

One deficiency we encounter with Subversion is merge tracking.  This means when we merge branches or revisions we have to keep track in a manual or scripted process which has its own overhead.<br /><br />I am pleased to see that <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> now has its own <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/merge-tracking/">merge tracking project</a>, which is in its infancy but when it drops it will make it an even better and more powerful system.  The page has additional links for external merge tracking scripts like <a href="http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py">svnmerge</a>.</div>

At work we do code reviews as part of our development process.  This means every commit has to have an additional set of eyes go over it and confirm the edits are good and adhere to the coding standards.<br /><br />This can be an intrusive process, but also can be priceless.  The creator of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> Guido van Rossum has developed a code review system whilst working for Google.  The system is called Mondrian and there is some more information <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/11/google-mondrian.html">here on a blog interview</a>.  Currently it uses Perforce but in order for it to be released as open-source it will also work for Subversion and different database backends.</div>

One thing I have been continually sidetracked from sorting out recently is menus for Windows Vista.<br /><br />Currently we use DrawItem() and MeasureItem() to custom draw the menu items so that they have icons next to the items.  Unfortunately on Vista the custom drawing of the base implementation of DrawItem() simply does not look right under Vista.  It utilises the solid dark blue bar when you hover the mouse and the spacings look odd, and this is the default implementation.  Also, the background colour is a little darker and the disabled text does not look very good.  Without the custom draw functions it integrates much better in Vista, but I need to finish implementing some code for the associated icons.<br /><br />So, I was using Windows Explorer under Vista and realised the context menus have EXACTLY the same problem.  This is just completely insane, they obviously implemented the functionality in exactly the same way, but the underlying Windows API could not have been updated for this.</div>

A few days ago I mentioned the <a <br />href=&#8221;http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/11/windows-vista-new-start-menu.html&#8221;>Windows Start Menu mess</a>.  I simply wasn&#8217;t impressed by it (you can also see the link to the Joel on Software blog post about it).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.drizzle.com/~lettvin/2006/11/windows-shutdown-crapfest.html">Apparently 24 developers got their hands dirty working on this</a>, and it still turned out the way it has.  I still look at the menu that pops up with the restart, etc. and wonder who let it out the door as it is a simple pop-up menu, not really revolutionary, and it doesn&#8217;t even have associated icons.<br /><br />All I can say about the turning off scenario is most people know what to do with a TV or DVD player, why is not that simple?</div>

In my job I develop CAM (Computer Aided Machining) software.  To be honest there are very few decent resources on the web for it and it is a very closed development arena.<br /><br />There are some people out there trying to change this.  There are two developers (who I used to work with) called Julian Todd and Martin Dunschen who believe in open-ness in development.  They have a great little blog <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/index.php">here</a>.  You can also try out the online version of their <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/">machining algorithm</a>.</div>

It&#8217;s not often a thread on GUI programming comes up on <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> but there is one <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/11/25/205243">here</a>.  There are probably some useful links in the comments if you dig enough.<br /><br />I dunno, it strikes me there is a lack of discussion about GUIs in general compared to other programming subjects, possibly due to entrenched positions about what everyone personally sees as &#8220;best&#8221;.</div>

I finally got to the bottom of my outstanding OpenGL problem on Vista.  It seems that the drivers were throwing floating point exceptions in random places, I tidied up the code as much as possible but it still happened.  The only way to get around this problem was to not unmask the floating point exceptions in the thread performing the OpenGL rendering (although most applications seem not to unmask floating point exceptions as I have discovered).<br /><br />I imagine when the drivers are as mature as the XP drivers these will be but a distant memory, as in the olden days the way the OpenGL drivers handled exceptions was pretty random.<br /><br />One thing I want to reiterate is that OpenGL works seamlessly on Vista with the dwm Aero experience.  People still think they have to migrate away from OpenGL to DirectX/Direct3D, I cannot emphasise enough this is not the case.  I know some companies still haven&#8217;t managed to filter through that information, but it is the case and the computer I am using is evidence of that.<br /><br />So spread the word OpenGL is fully compatible and runs natively with Windows Vista!</div>

Sorry for the delay in replying.<br /><br />That phrase was the best terminology I could some up with.  What Microsoft originally said was it would only run through emulation or if you wanted full acceleration then you would have a compromised Windows graphical experience (only a metter of concern for non fullscreen applications).<br /><br />Anyway, they removed the artificial barrier for OpenGL (as the limitations were strategic not technical) so that you canrun hardware accelerated OpenGL with minimal abstraction for the hardware without compromising the look of Windows Vista.  Microsoft would still prefer you to use DirectX/Direct3D though.</div>

Can you explain exactly what you mean by &#8220;runs natively with Windows Vista&#8221;?  Does the &#8220;Vista API&#8221; have OpenGL fcts. built into it?<br /><br />I guess I should dust off my copy of &#8220;Computer Graphics with OpenGL&#8221; that is collecting dust on my shelf.<br /><br />Cheers.</div>
