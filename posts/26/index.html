An interesting library I stumbled across on the Internet the other day enables the user to accelerate general code by using your graphics hardware.  An open-source library <a href="http://libsh.org/">libsh</a> provides a high level metaprogramming language in C++ for programming GPUs.<br /><br />Unfortunately, libsh is no longer actively developed because the developers behind it have created a commercial business around it (those lucky guys have found a way to make programming pay!)<br /><br />It would be nice to utilise the processing power of the GPU, essentially treating the hardware like another (more specialised) processing core.  After all graphics cards have more transistors than the average CPU&#8230;  I think I mentioned something like this in my <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/12/multiple-core-madness.html">multithreading post</a> many a moon ago.  But I suppose also it ties into virtualisation of the procesing hardware available on the computer which I even <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/10/virtualisation-understanding.html">posted about before</a>.<br /><br />A great website for this type of stuff is <a href="http://www.gpgpu.org/">General-Purpose Computation Using Graphics Hardware</a> which does exactly what it says on the tin.  There are active forums and tons of news and information.<br /><br />Surprisingly there is not a huge amount of general purpose stuff out there freely available but as GPUs become more powerful and more programmable I am sure that will change.  Personally I think the future would be to use a core of these multi-core processors to do the graphics, even if it is slightly specialised for stream processing or something.  That would certainly negate the need for faster graphics buses as it would run on the processor (although other buses would still need to progress).  But yet again I have digressed&#8230;.</div>

I&#8217;ve mentioned before about the usefulness of <a href="http://www.gimpel.com/">PC-Lint</a> when doing C++ development on Windows.  It closes off a whole class of bugs that can live in a codebase and raises teh minimum standard of development.<br /><br />I came across a really decent article you can read <a href="http://powerof2games.com/node/27">here</a>.  They integrated it into their automated build process and bootstrapped Msbuild to use it.<br /><br />Also, you can&#8217;t forget that there are some good tools that can make it easier to use.  There is <a href="http://www.riverblade.co.uk/products/lintproject/">LintProject</a> to run Lint across an entire project, and also there is the <a href="http://www.riverblade.co.uk/products/visual_lint/index.html">Visual Lint</a> which is a nice integration into Visual Studio.<br /><br />It would be nice however if somehow it was possible to integrate it completely with the cl.exe commandline.</div>

Hi,<BR/><BR/>It would be nice to have more options on the compiler to help with things like const-correctness, uninitialised data and the suchlike.<BR/><BR/>Admittedly Lint is on version 8.0 but it is on something like revision &#8220;v&#8221; and there is one for each letter of the alphabet ;)<BR/><BR/>I think that the tool is so simple to use that it kind of transcends the new version needed philosophy.  I imagine if they supplied the integration with lots of products there would be even less versions of Lint out&#8230;<BR/><BR/>PVCS 5.3?  Will any of the conversion scripts out there work for that to get to a new revision control system?  The one I have seen works on version 6.8 upwards&#8230;<BR/><BR/>Thanks,<BR/>Garry</div>

What I would like is an opensource version of it. Something that has been around so long, you would of thought that the large OS developers would be in need of such a tool and thus a project be born.<BR/><BR/>When I saw the powerof2 article, I had a look at our software cupboard and there was a copy of PCLint7.5 dated 1998. So in 10 years it has advanced less than a single version:-)<BR/><BR/>Then again we are using PVCS5.3 - a horribly broken Windows 3.1 program botched to Win95 while Team Foundation Server sits in the aforementioned cupboard. But that is an article in itself.</div>

With all the tools out there to make developer&#8217;s lives easier, what would I do when starting a new project.  When starting a new development project the initial decisions you make reflect throughout the life of the codebase because once the ship is in sail it is hard to change direction without real willingness.<br /><br />There are really two areas that this would cover, first the tools you use, and then how you use those tools.<br /><br />Lets say that you are developing on Windows.  You would use Visual Studio instinctively, unfortunately the build system sucks in the worst way when it comes to project dependencies and command-line operations. You could use something like CMake or bjam or any one of the other build systems available.  The problem then is that the features always lag behind what is available within the IDE.<br /><br />But I am going off on a tangent.  I am deciding on a development environment for a new project (C++).  Right then what could we use that is more or less free&#8230;<br />* Source control : Subversion<br />    The main reason to use this is that there are so many tools available (most specifically TortoiseSVN).<br />* Bug tracking : Trac<br />    I would rather a more powerful bug tracking system (I am a big fan of Bugzilla) but the tight integration with Subversion is a major plus point.  Plus you get a wiki for free, and with the plug-ins you can have continuous integration and a myriad of other things integrated in one Intranet website.<br />* Compiler : Visual Studio<br />    This means you can support 32 and 64-bit (which MinGW sadly lacks at the moment) targets.<br />* Continuous Integration : Cruise Control.NET<br />    Regular builds make sure that you haven&#8217;t gone too far down the wrong path.  It can also be used to do other processes like testing or analysis.  You can integrate it with Trac as well here http://syntactic.org/2007/7/23/cruisecontrol-net-trac-integration or here https://oss.werkbold.de/trac-cc/.<br />* Wiki : Trac<br />    Developer documentation should be quick and easy to edit and should be encourages.  It&#8217;s good news it is also part of Trac.<br />* Unit testing : Boost<br />    Using Boost in a C++ project makes perfect sense, so using their unit testing framework would therefore be a good idea.  It can be difficult to drive but other C++ unit testing frameworks are as much a pain so rolling your own could also be an idea.<br />* Batch testing : Python<br />    Python scripting would be a good idea for doing actual system testing.  What would be even better is the ability to run the program due to Python being embedded in the program to drive it.  Get the output well formed and I think it can be integrated with Trac as well.<br /><br />When you start:<br />* All commits must have a comment and preferably a bug number so you can always work out the reasoning behind all edits.  Being able to work out why is always useful to a developer.<br />* Compile with the warning levels on the maximum available level and have warnings as errors.<br />* Try to use some static analysis like Lint to improve the baseline coe quality.<br /><br />By building in high standards in the beginning you don&#8217;t have to go through laborious and error-prone tasks later in the day retrofitting some standard process.  Also, I like the idea of having Trac as a port of call or documentation, source code, and analysis means as a developer you can&#8217;t complain any of the process is too difficult.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve probably left out loads but its a start at least&#8230;</div>

For folks developing on Windows who might prefer less Python, more C#, an alternative to Trac might be <A HREF="http://ifdefined.com/bugtrackernet.html" REL="nofollow">BugTracker.NET</A>.  Free, open-source.  (I&#8217;m the author). It supports <A HREF="http://ifdefined.com/doc_bug_tracker_subversion.html" REL="nofollow">Subversion integration</A> much like Trac. According to a paper somebody wrote for his college class, it can be <A HREF="http://www.scs.carleton.ca/~deugo/comp5900/papers/BugTrackerAndCCNet.pdf" REL="nofollow">integrated with CruiseControl.NET</A>, although I don&#8217;t have any experience with that.</div>

On Subversion at least you can force people to give comments (and with TortoiseSVN force them to supply bug numbers!)</div>

Regarding CruiseControl: You may want to see Len Holgate&#8217;s view on it: http://www.lenholgate.com/<BR/><BR/>&#8221;* All commits must have a comment and preferably a bug number so you can always work out the reasoning behind all edits. Being able to work out why is always useful to a developer.&#8221; We did this at a previous company. You can also extract the information out when a build was successful and append it to an email and send it to the testers so they knew what WinRunner/Mercury scripts to run. Unfortunately this was many years ago and the email rarely turned up, and certain colleagues never commented their check-ins.<BR/><BR/>(forgot to attach link)</div>

Microsoft have just released the beta of the Visual Studio 2008 &#8220;Feature Pack&#8221; which is an update for the C++ portion of the environment.  The main features are substantial updates to MFC and TR1 library support.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">The VC++ 2008 MFC libraries have been extended to support creation of applications that have:<br />    * Office Ribbon style interface<br />    * Office 2007, Office 2003 and Office XP look and feel<br />    * Modern Visual Studio-style docking toolbars and panes<br />    * Fully customizable toolbars and menus<br />    * A rich set of advanced GUI controls<br />    * Advanced MDI tabs and groups<br />    * And much more!<br /><br />This feature pack also includes an implementation of TR1. Portions of TR1 are scheduled for adoption in the upcoming C++0x standard as the first major addition to the ISO 2003 standard C++ library. Our implementation includes a number of important features such as:<br />    * Smart pointers<br />    * Regular expression parsing<br />    * New containers (tuple, array, unordered set, etc)<br />    * Sophisticated random number generators<br />    * Polymorphic function wrappers<br />    * Type traits<br />    * And more!<br /><br />Note: This feature pack does not include C99 compatibility or support for special math functions.</span><br /><br />Certainly for anyone maintaining MFC based products it is a free upgrade tot he look and feel of the program with tons of advantages.<br /><br />You can <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=D466226B-8DAB-445F-A7B4-448B326C48E7&displaylang=en">download it here</a>.  Unfortunately it tries to force you to download Silverlight which I have been avoiding like the plague but the attempts to get you to install it from Microsoft are getting more aggressive.</div>

Part of the reason I have been so quiet recently isn&#8217;t just getting old and turning 30, or even the Norovirus I managed to catch in time to blow the bowels out of Christmas.  The main reason is that I had my head down before starting a new job.<br /><br />Today was my first day at <a href="http://www.displaylink.com">Displaylink</a> which is a rapidly expanding display technology company in Cambridge who are good enough to host the <a href="http://www.accu.org">ACCU Meetings</a>.<br /><br />Hopefully I can now get back to a normal blogging service now all of the upheaval should be coming to an end.  I had a good seven and a bit years working on the same codebase and hopefully have contributed some decent things to those companies.  It was always a shame to say goodbye to <a href="http://www.ncgraphics.net">NC Graphics</a> when PTC took over, but it also helped me to decide to try something new.<br /><br />Now I can&#8217;t see it as a conflict of interest I should do some CAM blogging although it would never be as good as <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/index.php">Julian Todd&#8217;s</a> and I would be approaching it from a higher level perspective.</div>

This is something I definitely don&#8217;t have.  I&#8217;m a bit of a hoarder, a magpie maybe, collecting shiny things.  When I encounter a seemingly useful piece of code on the Internet I would download it and dump it into my downloads directory.  I&#8217;ve probably got gigabytes of the stuff.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t know what it is.  I certainly feel that whatever I try to do someone must have at least tried it out before, so Google is my best friend in that respect.<br /><br />You could say it is because C++ has so much not in the standard library that is available in frameworks like .NET and others.  Maybe, but then that gives you choice and encourages you to think about the problem you are trying to solve and the best solution that you can come up with.<br /><br />Fortunately loads of these tools and libraries are open-source so it is possible to help improve the baseline of thee libraries.  Unfortunately you need to know where to look to find these as there is no central resource that can point you in the right direction to find the libraries that would be best for you.  The closest I have found is the <a href="http://www.twilightsembrace.com/personal/gamelibs.php">Free Game Development Libraries Page</a>.<br /><br />I think one of the skills I have picked up from being such a magpie is the ability to look at other people&#8217;s code and to bend it to my own devices.  Say for instance there is something useful, but not quite what I want on CodeProject, I&#8217;d refactor the code (way too much avoids <a href="http://www.kirit.com/On following rules/Encapsulation is a Good Thing™">encapsulation</a> over there) and bring it in line with my own coding guidelines.  I am then in a position to use and extend the code further.<br /><br />Not Invented Here Syndrome I don&#8217;t see as a good thing or at least a strict adherence to it is a weaknes.  By reusing code you also have the possibility of giving something back as well to the potential &#8220;state of the art&#8221;.  Certainly not all code should be off-the-shelf and cookie cutter simplified implementations but it should provide the basis of what you are doing in order to avoid reinventing the wheel.  I certainly see understanding someone else&#8217;s code as an important skill in development.</div>

Thanks to a comment on one of the posts about autoexp.dat and STLPort where I did a bit of a ham-fisted attempt at creating visualisers for STL containers in the Visual Studio 2005 debugger, I have been informed that there is a much better (and more comprehensive) version than my hack.<br /><br />Now as part of the upcoming version 5.2 of STLPort there is a comprehensive and well written set of visualisers.  This means debugging is now on parity with the in-built Microsoft containers.  The version linked to in this post is for 5.2 but does work well with 5.1.<br /><br />You can get the <a href="http://stlport.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/stlport/trunk/STLport/etc/autoexp.dat?revision=HEAD">autoexp.dat edits here</a>.  It points to the Subversion repository head version.  Since it will be part of the distribution it should be maintained and provides another excellent reason for using it (as well as the performance).<br /><br />If anyone is using my hack then please use this version from the good people at STLPort - it is much better!<br /><br />I suppose now it would be nice to have something similar for Boost&#8230;</div>

Sometimes even being multithreaded isn&#8217;t even enough.  Obviously running multiple processes simultaneously is great and all but it depends how heavyweight the processes are as you could be spending a lot of calculation time in a single process not giving much more than a responsive GUI during calculation (not making the most of the computing power).  What you really want to do is divide those processes into their smallest components and parallelise those.<br /><br />One of the tools freely available to C++ developers to accomplish these types of tasks is <a href="http://threadingbuildingblocks.org">Threading Building Blocks</a> which was open-sourced this year by Intel.  In fact, I am pretty sure I mentioned this before, but I am nearly thirty so my brain ain&#8217;t what it used to be.  There are actually two parts to the library, a thread-safe set of allocators and the multithreading library including algorithms and thread-safe containers.<br /><br />It is designed with the STL in mind (I suppose the developers would hope for an eventual inclusion into the standard library). It seems to be designed at a higher level semantically than a lot of other threading libraries and could help people to try it out much faster.<br /><br />The most obvious place to try out some of the parallelisation is the &#8220;parallel_for&#8221; loop.  It&#8217;s interesting that speed optimisation can be tried out with a &#8220;grain size&#8221; as it is a trade off between the overhead of performing parallel operations and making use of the processor(s).  It all works in a similar fashion to the normal STL algorithms and containers with some additional classes like &#8220;ranges&#8221; for the begin and end of your divided up operation.  In fact it all seems so strangely easy to do, if you have to do calculations and construct new data, stick them in one of the thread-safe containers and you will be laughing.  Admittedly if you do use &#8220;normal loops&#8221; in your code, you need to STL-ise them, but that is a fairly trivial operation to turn them into functors.<br /><br />All in all though it looks quite good, and easy to use if you are parallelising simple loops.  I am sure some programs will find substantial speed-ups and blow up a few CPUs with over-use from that.  I could tell you a story that Intel tech support said we shouldn&#8217;t run a Pentium III CPU at 100% use consistently back in the day&#8230;</div>
