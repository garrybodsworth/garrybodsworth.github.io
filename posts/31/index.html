Finally, I am getting around to an update to the TortoiseSVN Visual Studio Integration.  The catalyst for this is the release of Visual Studio 2008 (formally codename Orcas) Beta 2, and making sure I can still play with Subversion through the IDE.<br /><br />I have made a new distribution ZIP file with a few more configurations inside.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/Subversion.zip">Download it here.</a></span><br /><br />It has a few more features than before including some for dealing with conflicts.  The distribution itself has a few more files so you can decide whether you want to just have the menus, toolbars or context menus.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1xvreyfQ6ns/Rq5I_talWbI/AAAAAAAAAAM/55l1sNrJM7o/s1600-h/Toolbar.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1xvreyfQ6ns/Rq5I_talWbI/AAAAAAAAAAM/55l1sNrJM7o/s320/Toolbar.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093088487962663346" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Supported operations</span><br /><br />The following Subversion/TortoiseSVN features are covered in the integration:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Commit</span> - Commit the files to the repository</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span> - Update the current working version</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">History</span> - Get the history for the selected file</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Diff</span> - Get the diff compared to the base version</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Blame</span> - Find out who committed the crimes in the file</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Revert</span> - Undo changes</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modifications</span> - Check to see if any files have been modified</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit Conflicts</span> - Edit the conflicts that arise from merging/updating</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Resolve</span> - Mark the file as resolved for conflicts</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Repository</span> - View the repository on the server</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Project History</span> - Get the history of the entire project</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Solution</span> - Add the solution being edited to source control</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Branch/Tag</span> - Perform a branch or tag operation on the current working copy</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Settings</span> - Set up TortoiseSVN</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">SubversionInstall.vbs</span><br /><br />This simply installs a set of External Tools into Visual Studio for common TortoiseSVN operations.  It can be installed on versions above Visual Studio.NET (version 7.0).  Currently it is configured for Visual Studio 2008 (version 9.0), to make it work on other versions change the variable &#8220;strVisualStudioVersionNumber&#8221; as outlined in the file&#8217;s comments.<br /><br />Also, if you have installed TortoiseSVN in a non-default location, make sure that you change the variable &#8220;strTortoiseSVNBin&#8221; to the correct binary path.  Make sure that the backslashes are doubled up.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">SubversionMenu.vssettings</span><br /><br />This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.<br /><br />This adds a menu to the IDE for TortoiseSVN with the appropriate icons.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">SubversionMenuToolbar.vssettings</span><br /><br />This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.<br /><br />This adds a menu for TortoiseSVN as well as a toolbar using the appropriate icons.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">SubversionMenuToolbarContexts.vssettings</span><br /><br />This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.<br /><br />This adds not only the menu and toolbar, but also adds the items to the appropriate context menus for files and solutions.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">SubversionMenuToolbarContextsVS2005.vssettings</span><br /><br />This provides the menu, toolbar and context menus for TortoiseSVN in Visual Studio 2005.<br /><br />Unfortunately there is no good solution for file renaming (I always do it through Windows Explorer) since this integration uses the External tools and allows for it to work in Visual Studio Express.</div>

Hey<BR/> <A HREF="http://www.blogger.com/profile/06424543930869218613" REL="nofollow">Bluehorse</A> uninstall is not that difficult after removing all the registry you must set ToolNumKeys=2 you will find this in External tools only.<BR/><BR/>This means no need to remove registry entry just keep playing with the ToolNumKeys.<BR/><BR/>:)</div>

Hello, regarding uninstall, editing the registry is a pain and not simple in this case, I end up with 21 grayed out menu items &#8216;External command&#8217; in Vs2008 in the Tools menu. Would be absolutely great if you could include an uninstall script.<BR/><BR/>Would also be nice if the svn commands could be grouped into a submenu.<BR/><BR/>Great approach anyway :)<BR/>2 cents</div>

Gary, thanks for your work. On start up, I still get the error,<BR/><BR/>&#8220;The project MyProject.vcproj appears to be under source control, but the associated source control plug-in is not installed on this computer. Source control will be disabled for this project.&#8221;<BR/><BR/>Even though the toolbar seems to work. Can you help me understand why that might be? I installed the seetings for VS2005. Thanks!!</div>

Would you be able to write better installation steps? As you say what the files are but not how to actually install it. <BR/>What do I do with the .vbs? does it need to go into a project? Why not put it together more, even an exe would be better.<BR/><BR/>Cheers<BR/><BR/>Andrew</div>

I&#8217;m pretty sure you must have TortoiseSVN installed on the same machine you&#8217;re running Visual Studio from. <BR/><BR/>I use SSH over the network without any problems.</div>

Ok. this looks like a good alternative to VSS but am a little stuck&#8230;<BR/>Am setting up a LAN environment, the TortoiseSVN in on another machine.<BR/>I mapped the tortoisesvn to a local drive and chaged the path accordingly but all i have is grayed out menus&#8230;and all of them are a premade menu, kind of cluttering things. Can someone help me?<BR/><BR/>For the guys that have this working, has anyone tried a LAN setting?</div>

I installed your setting files and also installed tortoiseSVN but i can add the solution to the repository, i can&#8217;t commit the solution. It gives me this error &#8220;C:\Documents and Settings\gilbert\Belgelerim\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\denemeninkrali is no a working copy. Can&#8217;t open file: C:\Documents and Settings\gilbert\Belgelerim\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\denemeninkrali&#46;svn\entries: System cannot find the path&#8221;. So i checked the document over and over to make sure if i make something wrong but everything was ok. What should i do now?</div>

In the screenshot, it displays a separate toolbar for Subversion.  When I installed this, however, it just dropped all of the options into the pre-existing Tools toolbar, in a rather unattractive manner.  Did I do something wrong, or is there an easy fix for this? Thanks.</div>

Hello jorge,<BR/><BR/>I&#8217;ve tried opening the settings file in wordpad, i&#8217;ve found out that the related directories is hard coded as &#8220;c:&#92;program files&#92;&#8221;&#8230; What I did is I replaced the directory string into the target directory of tortoise SVN, and it just works fine.

Sorry, forgot to say how to add it to the context menus.<BR/><BR/>Right click on the toolbars backgrounds and select &#8220;Customize&#8221;.  From the list in the toolbars tick &#8220;Context Menus&#8221; - this option is hidden when not in Customize mode.<BR/><BR/>From the new toolbar select &#8220;Project and Solution Context Menus&#8221;.  The &#8220;Item&#8221; context menu is for an individual file, and the &#8220;Solution&#8221; is for the solution.  You can probably ignore the rest.<BR/><BR/>To add one of the external tools you need to know which External Tools number maps to the TortoiseSVN command - you can see this in &#8220;Customize&#8221; mode when looking at the &#8220;Tools&#8221; menu.  On the &#8220;Commands&#8221; tab on the &#8220;Customize&#8221; dialog select &#8220;Tools&#8221; then drag the items named External Command (number) to the menu/toolbar.<BR/><BR/>Hope this helps.</div>

I have no problems creating the additional external tools for item Commit/Update, but am at a loss on how to assosiate them with the context menu. The only thing missing is the actual ID for the command. I could copy and paste the rest in the settings.<BR/><BR/>Personally I use Tortoise directly from Explorer, however, I have coworkers who are more into the good old VSS UI and would like the icon overlays. I downloaded the Ankh source yesterday and skimmed through the filenames looking for a n instant clue where to look for the overlays, but didn&#8217;t have the time to look more into it. I guess figuring it out when I have the time shouldn&#8217;t cause too much trouble creating a simple addin with the functionality of using the correct overlay.<BR/><BR/>However, I like the simplicity of the integration (no coding) and expect to use it frequently.<BR/><BR/>Thank you for your work so far.</div>

<div class='author'>Garry Bodsworth</div>
<div class='content'>
In order to have a commit/update for an individual file you would need to create a new commit/update command that uses $(ItemPath) and $(ItemDir).  Then you can easily add these to the context menus.<BR/><BR/>Doing the icon overlay is not necessary for me as I use Check For Modifications infrequently.  What I prefer about this integration is that it is a very thin layer wrapping the functionality that really does not get in the way.  I never really care what I&#8217;ve edited or anything like that until I commit.  I&#8217;ve changed the way I work with source control now in comparison to my days battling with VSS, it is actually almost a case of I don&#8217;t need to even think about the source control.<BR/><BR/>If you want a more comprehensive VSS style integration I recommend having a look at AnkhSVN:<BR/>http://ankhsvn.tigris.org/<BR/>This could also give you a hint at how to do icon overlays ;)</div>

I wouldn&#8217;t mind having an additional context menu for Commit/Update/etc for individual files/folders. I tried fixing it myself, but couldn&#8217;t figure out how to refer to commands (or find the id for a command).<BR/><BR/>I&#8217;ve also started looking into a way of making solution explorer use overlay icons from Tortoise/Explorer, but VS extensibility isn&#8217;t my area ;o) <BR/><BR/>So far I have found this integration to be very sweet ;o)</div>

Intel has just <a href="http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/">open-sourced their Threading Building Blocks library</a>.  Intel describe it as a &#8220;rich and complete approach to expressing parallelism in a C++ program&#8221;.<br /><br />With multi-threading in general being so immature when looking at other libraries, another solution can never hurt.  So add it to Boost.Threads, OpenMP, wxThread and the myriad of others.  Admittedly the way that all of the alternatives work is very low-level and means very careful design is required.<br /><br />I&#8217;m interested to see the approach of the library to multi-threading as it looks quite complicated to wrap your head around.  The best bit though is there is apparently a cache aligned memory allocator as part of it that can be used independently.<br /><br />There is a Slashdot article about it <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/07/07/25/1324221.shtml">here</a>.  Also a bog post <a href="http://softwareblogs.intel.com/2006/12/18/threading-building-blocks-solution-looking-for-a-problem/">here</a> looks interesting covering the subject.<br /><br />All I can say is let battle commence and lets see what multi-threading packages are left standing ;)</div>

Argh!  The web has been down at work for over 24 hours.  I now realise it is 100% essential for my job.  Google has replaced a certain portion of my brain&#8230;.  I can&#8217;t answer any questions without it (okay, a slight exaggeration).<br /><br />One tool I have now found indispensable now is <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>.  Up until recently I have used the Google Browser Sync for using my bookmarks at multiple locations.  The problem I found is I am very selective about what I bookmark as current bookmarking UIs available in IE and FireFox do not scale very well.  Then I get in the situation I haven&#8217; bookmarked something and I spend ages on Google tryin to find it again.<br /><br />I decided to move to del.ico.us as there was a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615">new tool for Firefox</a> which replaces the bookmarking system in Firefox, so now I use it exclusively tagging webpages at will.  Obviously the number of bookmarks I have is increasing rapidly especially since I can even tag individual articles.<br /><br />As you can see on the sidebar you can see what I am currently bookmarking and what I have bookmarked.  I have also added the ability to bookmark individual articles quickly if you want.  I tend to find most web technologies a bit hollow (MySpace Facebook and the suchlike) but this is a tool that reallyhelps make the web a better place, and all users of the system are sharing what they know with their bookmarks.</div>

Since getting my Macbook Pro one of the most useful pieces of software I have installed is <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>.  It is a port package for OS X which used to be called DarwinPorts, this is package management much like Linux tends to provide.  This makes it easy http://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gifto get updates and manage the software installed.<br /><br />At the moment it has over 4000 pieces of software available.  It is ultimately how I am running Python, wxPython, Bazaar and Mercurial.<br /><br />MacPorts has just <a href="http://www.macports.org/?p=60">released version 1.5</a>.  You can see the changelog <a href="http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/macports/browser/tags/release_1_5_0/base/ChangeLog">here</a>.<br /><br />What makes it particularly nice to use is the excellent Cocoa interface for it called <a href="http://porticus.alittledrop.com/">Porticus</a>.  It makes it all simple and intuitive and wraps up all the major features.</div>

The <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> distributed source control system has some Google Summer Of Code Projects.  One of which is the Visual Studio integration and recently there has been a status update on the mailing list talking about progress - <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/bazaar/2007q3/027836.html">read it here</a>.<br /><br />I think the distributed source control system that catches on will probably be the one which manages to get together the best external tools and UI.  Bazaar seems to have a few projects that are actively developed that could deal with that and make it quite a contender.<br /><br />Part of the development for this project though is wrapping the API in a Microsoft embeddable way.  An interesting approach but I can think of a few other routes.</div>

One of the reasons blogging has been quiet the past week or so is I&#8217;ve been fiddling about with some coding.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been trying out <a href="http://www.wxpython.org">wxPython</a> and using it as an interface to a distributed source control system.  It&#8217;s purely experimental, but it did show me some deficiencies and strengths in some of the ones available.<br /><br />Here is what I learnt though&#8230;  wxPython is a great way of hacking together a coherent UI fast, I am still relatively inexperienced in Python and wxPython but the resources out there on the Internet are very useful.<br /><br />As for the source control systems&#8230;  First I tried out <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial</a>, but I am really struggling with the API and trying to write extensions.  This is mainly due to the lack of documentation, and a lot of current tools like <a href="http://qct.sourceforge.net/">Qct</a> simply parse the commandline.  I did work out some of the parts of the API to wrap, but I found it hard going with limited Python knowledge and a lack of comments.<br /><br />The other system I tried was <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> which I found a very different experience.  The API is excellently documented and the plug-in API is excellent.  Admittedly the criticism levelled at this source contrl system is the speed, but it gets so much right.  It is built on a solid foundation of correctness and the barrier for entry is lowered thanks to the excellent documentation.  I managed o get a working status dialog up and running in a very short period of time (although admittedly I got sidetracked afterwards fiddling around with wxPython).<br /><br />One of the reasons I was using wxPython is that it looks native on my Macbook Pro as a lot of the available UIs are GTK based meaning they look pretty bad on OS X.  Also I wanted to try it out on Windows which meant it looked pretty good on that platform as well.<br /><br />Hopefully I can find the time to tidy some of this code up into a reusable form and actually see something like at least the status and commit dialogs through to completion.</div>

I found that the Mercurial book was pretty good when it came to writing plugins. That and looking at the source for other plugins.</div>

Leading on from my previous posts <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/06/tortoises-are-coming.html">here</a> and <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/06/distributed-revision-control-mercurial.html">here</a>  I have been doing a lot of research into the distributed revision control arena.<br /><br />Admittedly I have got fixated on three, <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a>, <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a> and <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a>.  All three projects are about the same age, but each have their own strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Briefly to sum them up Git is fast, it has a large developer community behind it and seems to be developing at breakneck speed.  The disadvantages are mainly due to the reliance on the POSIX systems which means cross-platform (well, Windows) support is weak.  I know there are some initiatives to get it working on Windows but I can see it losing steam as there is not enough interest in it due to the POSIX platform supports being so strong.  Also, Git is a bit more obscure than the others due to being a bit more low-level with plug-ins adding the ease of use.<br /><br />Mercurial is written is Python and is easily cross-platform  It is much simpler than the aforementioned Git to use and is close to it in speed and storage.  The disadvantages which I must admit are not many are that the community is not as fast moving as Git, but new versions are very regular.  I do see this as a better prospect than Git as it is better designed whereas as better design is being retroactively added to Git.<br /><br />Bazaar (Bazaar NG to give it its full name) is sponsored by <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a>, the company running Ubuntu.  Mark Shuttleworth has blogged about Bazaar recently which I mentioned in a previous post.  Bazaar is also written in Python and is cross-platform with a nice Windows installer for those people scared of installing Python.  It is very well designed with comprehensive renaming and merge support.  The main disadvantage is that it is not as fast as Mercurial or Git.  To be honest I am taking a liking to this system and have been investigating it quite deeply (but that is for another post).<br /><br />These three young projects are really progressing fast though and they are already good enough to use providing you are not too tied to your current extras from more mature systems (like TortoiseSVN).</div>

The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> IDE (which is cross-platform and designed to have plug-ins written for) has a good C++ module called <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">CDT</a> (C/C++ Development Toolkit).<br /><br />Recently version <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help33/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/concepts/cdt_c_whatsnew.htm">4.0 was released</a> in tandem with the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20070627_europarelease.php">Europa release of Eclipse</a>.  It has been massively improved and gives much better Windows support.<br /><br />Now the lead developer of CDT, Doug Schaefer, has started a new project called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdt-windows">CDT For Windows</a> which aims to make it obscenely simple to install and run Eclipse+CDT on Windows.  Check out <a href="http://cdtdoug.blogspot.com/2007/06/introducing-cdt-for-windows.html">his post announcing this here</a>.  This is a great step forward and I hope this works out well.</div>
