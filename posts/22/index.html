<div class="post-content"><p>The <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> Project (a C/C++/Objective-C front-end for the <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>) has recently released the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/StaticAnalysis.html">LLVM/Clang Static Analyzer</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit of a fan of static analysis, having posted quite a few times on my previous blog about Lint. Lint is much more comprehensive than the new one out of the Clang project but then again this is much younger and free.</p>

<p>At the moment the tool analyses C and Objective-C with rules to find problems with memory allocation patterns. It looks like the tool will be actively maintained as it will also be used inside of Apple. The HTML reports it generates are easy to use and read which is always a bonus.</p>

<p>There are a few posts about this analyser out there on the Internet. There are blog posts about using it <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/blog/2008/07/07/new-tool-on-the-block-the-llvmclang-static-analyzer/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2008/07/14/the-clang-static-analyzer/">here</a>. There is also the original <a href="http://www.reddit.com/info/6qhdj/comments/">Reddit discussion of the announcement</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly the <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium X</a> (instant messaging client) have started to use the tool and have discovered a few problems. The results of the analysis are <a href="http://trac.adiumx.com/wiki/StaticAnalysis">here</a> (although there is some kind of server error at the moment so you can see it in the Google Cache <a href="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:5K2wbL2DVJEJ:trac.adiumx.com/wiki/StaticAnalysis+clang+static+analysis&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=12&amp;gl=uk&amp;client=firefox-a">here</a>).</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I wanted to use WordPress for my blog, hence abandoning Blogspot, but I needed to find a hosting service that would allow me to do so.</p>

<p>I did lots of searching and decided to steer well clear of the cheap&#8217;n&#8217;cheerful hosts because I could read too many horror stories about them. Also, I wanted a UK host so support is on the same time zone as my existence as I am one of the strange computer types who doesn&#8217;t work on nocturnal hours.</p>

<p>After much searching I found a smaller company called <a href="http://www.clook.co.uk/">Clook</a> which had some good reviews mainly about the service. I bit the bullet and got the shared server package which was reasonably priced (£50 + VAT for the year).</p>

<p>What has really impressed me about them is how good their service is. When you have a problem they are quick and responsive and have a real grasp of how to actually fix things. They even helped me sort out the dead-brained error I had made installing WordPress.</p>

<p>The hosting provides all the features you could want when setting up a website with <a href="http://www.cpanel.net/index.html">cPanel</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastico_(web_hosting)">Fantastico</a>. You have the usual suspects running on Linux, Python, PHP, Perl, MySQL, and you can probably request some custom work if necessary. You also get backups and cron jobs.</p>

<p>So to sum up <a href="http://www.clook.co.uk/">Clook</a>, they have reasonable prices, excellent service, and provide some compelling features.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a> is my browser of choice on the Mac mainly because I can&#8217;t live without my Add-Ons.</p>

<p>To make Firefox more Mac-like I recommend the two following Add-Ons:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.takebacktheweb.org/">GrApple Deicious (Blue)</a> &#8211; Is a theme for Firefox that makes it look very close to Safari. Simply it looks like a Mac application so you never feel you are using an alien environment.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1951">Fission</a> &#8211; This changes the progress bar for loading pages. It changes the look so that the progress is shown in the address bar, which means you can switch off the status bar for an even more Mac-like experience.</li>
</ul>


<p>Just those two Add-Ons give Firefox 3 a real boost on the Mac (how shallow &#8211; it&#8217;s the surface experience). In Firefox 3 there have been more changes under the bonnet for better Mac integration with native-look widgets and improved rendering.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just on Mac the situation is improved, I have been using it on Windows Vista and to sum it up, Firefox 3 is blazingly fast and looks really quite good. The best feature is the improved speed of Javascript which really makes scripting-heavy websites a pleasure to use and you don&#8217;t seem to get the multiple tabs hanging when something complex is trying to happen.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>A difficulty with any company is keeping up that spirit of innovation when it is established. Different companies approach is in different ways or even not at all, so it is always interesting to hear how they approach it.</p>

<p>One of my favourite articles of recent times (which inspired the title of this post) is <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/04/17/pixars-brad-bird-on-fostering-innovation/">Pixar&#8217;s Brad Bird on Fostering Innovation</a>.</p>

<p>There is a great quote from Steve Jobs in the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jobs told him: “The only thing we’re afraid of is complacency—feeling like we have it all figured out,” Bird quotes his boss as saying “…We want you to come shake things up.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Brad Bird provides nine lessons, which although are for a creative animation company, are generally applicable. My favourite one is the first lesson, &#8220;Herd your black sheep&#8221;, which involves finding the artists with ideas for making things better, and allowing them to express their ideas.</p>

<p>I think in the world of computer development the lesson &#8220;Perfect is the Enemy of Innovation&#8221; is important, because the quest for perfect perfection takes your eyes off the ball of actually delivering something. Other ideas from the article is to discuss publicly within a team to interconnect everyone&#8217;s strengths, and high morale makes creativity (and by that token productivity) cheap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to protect your success&#8221; is not immediately obvious, but I guess simply trading one-upmanship with a competitor doesn&#8217;t give you any innovation. &#8220;Interaction = Innovation&#8221;, is another about communication by encouraging not just team communication but interdisciplinary communication, people should not be cordoned off in their own little world.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/static.py?page=about.html&amp;about=eng">Google 20% time</a> is the obvious example of attempting to foster innovation. Projects such as GMail, Google News, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/">MacFUSE</a> grew out of it. It is certainly one of the most talked about aspects of having a job at Google. Recently there have been rumours from places like Valleywag saying that 20% time is being cracked down on with areas like &#8220;Google Mail Labs&#8221; being started to give developers a sandbox for which to experiment with rather than having carte blanche. I think certainly more experienced developers probably find it easier to get more out-of-the-box ideas okayed though, but then again that doesn&#8217;t make such linkable headlines.</p>

<p>Another approach to this was used by Disney&#8217;s Black Rock Studios. They hosted a Minigame Week which was outlined in a two part interview with <a href="http://www.developmag.com">Develop Magazine</a> with <a href="http://www.developmag.com/interviews/133/Mickey-and-Minigames-Part-1">part one here</a> and <a href="http://www.developmag.com/interviews/132/Mickey-and-Minigames-Part-2">part two here</a>.</p>

<p>The idea within the studio was to spend some time being creative and make a minigame in a week as a team building exercise. This involved the entire company of about 120 people. An interesting part was that it allowed people who don&#8217;t traditionally work together to do so, and they also found leaders that they did not know about before.</p>

<p>The second part of the interview contains a developer&#8217;s diary of the week&#8217;s work. Rather scarily it ends in the crescendo on Friday afternoon presentations which must be nerve-racking to get the demo to work in a week&#8230; It sounds like it was hard work but sometimes these things don&#8217;t tire you out and invigorate you.</p>

<p>Going to conferences/conventions are those kind of invigorating events and I wish I could bottle that feeling. You talk to lots of people get loads of ideas then the feeling gradually dissipates over the following weeks.</p>

<p>I think all of this is more about the people rather than the end product. It has to be kept going even through the difficult times because it is part of the company culture and the moment it stops the goodwill dissipates quickly. These companies have found ways to do it right and I think any application of the the same ideals needs to be tailored for what the company is trying to achieve, hence the minigame for games companies.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I did start to write a post about my enthusiasm for technology, and more specifically how using Macs and the iPhone has been generally a pleasure. Then I suffered from the <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/07/11/apple_releases_iphone_and_ipod_touch_software_2_0_see_warning.html">iBrick upgrade</a> for my iPhone and got all depressed&#8230;</p>

<p>After persevering for several attempts, the upgrade took, and then all of the frustrations melted away. This upgrade adds massive value to the iPhone hardware I got last October. It&#8217;s not often you can say this about a phone.</p>

<p>One of the features I discovered this weekend whilst taking photos at the <a href="http://www.chelmsfordbeerfestival.org.uk/">Chelmsford Beer Festival</a> was geotagging. Now I know where I took photos which was particularly useful for documenting how someone had crashed their Subaru on a straight bit of road and wedged itself between a fence and a bollard.</p>

<p>But the reason I was so looking forward to the upgrade was getting my hands on some of the applications now available.</p>

<p>First up I got Super Monkey Ball which I suck at. It&#8217;s got amazing graphics and the right controller experience using the accelerometers, but I am useless at it. It&#8217;s definitely the big name game of the initial line-up.</p>

<p>Secondly I got a puzzler called Trism which is a nice and sedate game. I find it a pick up and play type game, so I can have a quick blast when I have a few spare minutes. Also, it is possible to pretend playing puzzle games improves your brain.</p>

<p>Finally, Super Monkey Ball may be the big name, but the best game out for the iPhone is Bejeweled. The controls work perfectly on the touch screen whether you are a double-tap or dragging player. Given the size of the images you&#8217;d expect to make lots of mistakes, but it is perfect, I have not hit a single wrong gem. The music is good and the graphics look as good as running on a desktop machine.</p>

<p>What I have noticed is now I have played some games the battery will get chomped through a lot faster than when I was only listening to music or leaving it in my pocket.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Recently <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> has been opening up more and more of its code, obviously hosting it on <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</a>. I thought I&#8217;d highlight a few of them.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/">Google C++ Testing Framework</a><br/>
<em>Google&#8217;s framework for writing C++ tests on a variety of platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Windows CE, and Symbian). Based on the xUnit architecture. Supports automatic test discovery, a rich set of assertions, user-defined assertions, death tests, fatal and non-fatal failures, various options for running the tests, and XML test report generation.</em></p>

<p>There are a number of C++ unit testing frameworks out there. A good article navigating the minefield can be read <a href="http://www.gamesfromwithin.com/articles/0412/000061.html">here</a>. Advantages of the this framework is mainly it is backed by Google, it is mature, supplies a lot of functionality, and that it is portable.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/">Protocol Buffers</a><br/>
<em>Protocol buffers are Google&#8217;s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages – Java, C++, or Python.</em></p>

<p>There are obviously loads of ways to serialise data, but it seems to support a number of languages and is space efficient (at least in comparison to XML). I&#8217;m not too sure how much it would offer over JSON although this does mean you don&#8217;t have to write or find some of the code yourself in the various languages.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ratproxy/">Ratproxy</a><br/>
*A semi-automated, largely passive web application security audit tool, optimized for an accurate and sensitive detection, and automatic annotation, of potential problems and security-relevant design patterns based on the observation of existing, user-initiated traffic in complex web 2.0 environments. Detects and prioritizes broad classes of security problems, such as dynamic cross-site trust model considerations, script inclusion issues, content serving problems, insufficient XSRF and XSS defenses, and much more. *</p>

<p>I mainly included this because I like the name&#8230; But it is also a useful tool for discovering weaknesses in your website&#8217;s security. I&#8217;ve read about commercial apps that do this but not too many open-source ones, so this release from Google can only be a good thing.</p>

<p><strong>Some other quick ones:</strong><br/>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dom-checker/">Browser DOM Checker</a><br/>
*A simple utility to thoroughly validate DOM, XMLHttpRequest, and cookie security restriction handling in modern web browsers. Notable features include exhaustive hierarchy crawling, cross-domain IPC system for blind write verification, page transition checks, and more. *</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/bunny-the-fuzzer/">Bunny the Fuzzer</a><br/>
*A closed loop, high-performance, general purpose protocol-blind fuzzer for C programs. Uses compiler-level integration to seamlessly inject precise and reliable instrumentation hooks into the traced program. These hooks enable the fuzzer to receive real-time feedback on changes to the function call path, call parameters, and return values in response to variations in input data. This architecture makes it possible to significantly improve the coverage of the testing process without a noticeable performance impact usually associated with other attempts to peek into run-time internals. *</p>

      <a href="/blog/2008/07/09/tortoisesvn-visual-studio-integration/">TortoiseSVN Visual Studio Integration</a>

<time datetime="2008-07-09T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true"></time>
</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>I developed this Visual Studio integration whilst migrating a previous company (NC Graphics) from Visual SourceSafe to the brave new world of <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>.  Developing is a bit of a strong word since it is only a settings file for Visual Studio, but it does the job admirably in a non-intrusive way and has no performance effects at all on the IDE.</p>

<p>The settings file gives you a new toolbar, a new menu, and new items on the context menus in the solution view.  You get some nice <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a> standard icons to make it even easier.</p>

<p>This all works with Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 (and even the Express Editions), along with a standard installation of TortoiseSVN.  Unless you want to edit the commandline in the External Tools I recommend installing TortoiseSVN to the default location.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s quick to set up, just go to your &#8220;Tools&#8221; menu and choose &#8220;Import and Export Settings&#8221; and follow the instructions. Ensure the tick box for which settings to import are all ticked.  If the settings don&#8217;t work first time, try again, as Visual Studio can be a bit flaky when loading.  It will replace your External Tools because they have to be stored in the correct numbered slot due to the way they are implemented in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Unfortunately renaming is well beyond the external tools implementation I have used.  TortoiseSVN 1.5 does have some additional functionality to rebuild the links for renamed files which is really useful.</p>

    <strong>Files In The Distribution</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>SubversionMenu.vssettings</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.  This adds a menu to the IDE for TortoiseSVN with the appropriate icons.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>SubversionMenuToolbar.vssettings</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.  This adds a menu for TortoiseSVN as well as a toolbar using the appropriate icons.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>SubversionMenuToolbarContexts.vssettings</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.  This adds not only the menu and toolbar, but also adds the items to the appropriate context menus for files and solutions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>SubversionMenuToolbarContextsVS2005.vssettings</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This provides the menu, toolbar and context menus for TortoiseSVN in Visual Studio 2005.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>SubversionInstall.vbs</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Use this file if you want the external tools only.  These will be appended to the list, otherwise use the settings files.  Don&#8217;t use in addition to the settings file.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This simply installs a set of External Tools into Visual Studio for common TortoiseSVN operations. It can be installed on versions above Visual Studio.NET (version 7.0). Currently it is configured for Visual Studio 2008 (version 9.0), to make it work on other versions change the variable &#8220;strVisualStudioVersionNumber&#8221; as outlined in the file&#8217;s comments.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also, if you have installed TortoiseSVN in a non-default location, make sure that you change the variable &#8220;strTortoiseSVNBin&#8221; to the correct binary path. Make sure that the backslashes are doubled up.

<div class="post-content"><p>Welcome to the Programmer&#8217;s Log (although I do wonder if it should be called Programmer Slog).</p>

<p>This is really a continuation of my previous blog <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com">Garry&#8217;s Bit Patterns</a>, but using WordPress, and on my own domain. I did consider importing all of the articles but it is best to start anew. The best content (like the TortoiseSVN Visual Studio integration) will make its way here.</p>

<p>Hopefully I will also be joined by some other programmers who slave at the coal face of day-to-day development, to share some of their pearls of wisdom.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to doing some WordPress hacking (expect a few posts about that) and some more artistic designing endeavours. Also expect me to try some web hackery now I have a server to play with &#8211; and I need to get my money&#8217;s worth.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,<br/>
Garry</p>

Here in the UK we had an episode of The Money Programme broadcast on the BBC called <a href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/b00c6sdc.shtml">Bill Gates: How a Geek Changed the World</a>.  Follow the link to see it on the iPlayer.<br /><br />An interesting part of this is <span style="font-style:italic;">Steve Wozniak: How it began</span> which is highlighted and can be watched on the BBC News site <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7464704.stm">here</a>.  It&#8217;s certainly nice to think of a time when the computer business wasn&#8217;t all about taking over the world.  It&#8217;s a brief video from how he got involved in computers, through starting Apple.<br /><br />It&#8217;s nice to see some programmes on TV that look at computing, in fact I&#8217;m amazed at the lack of ones about the history of computing.  Although we may be getting a dramatisation featuring <a href="http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/06/leo-dicaprio-at.html">Leonardo DiCaprio as a co-founder of Atari</a>&#8230;</div>
