There is an interesting explanation as to why the Aero Basic Interface looks the way it does when compared to the Aero accelerated theme.  You can read about it <a href="http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2006/10/12/Frequently-asked-questions-about-the-Aero-Basic-window-frame.aspx">here</a>.

It's quite an interesting little article since it shows Microsoft banging their heads up against the same limitations as GUI developers have been.
