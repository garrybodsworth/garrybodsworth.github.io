For the [CODA][1] application [Follow Flickr tags on your CODA screen][2] we have [released some source code on GitHub for this][3]. It&#8217;s a full-on Django App in the repository.

But within there is a little bit of code we call [FeedButcher][4] which is a very simple piece of Python code which carves up feeds. We needed it to get pictures out of feeds for our Flickr app.

It&#8217;s released under MIT license so if anyone else can find a use for it/improve it &#8211; have fun.
