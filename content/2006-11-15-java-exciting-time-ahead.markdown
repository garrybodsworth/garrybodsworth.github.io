It's only a couple of days since the news that Java is going GPL.  The kind of initial flurry has died down but the substance is starting to come along.

The <a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/">OpenJDK</a> project is off and running.  There are two parts - the <a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/compiler/">Java Compiler</a> and the <a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/hotspot/">Java Hotspot VM</a>.

The <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish Project</a> is for the goal of building open-source, production quality, enterprise software.  This project is already a year old.

I've downloaded some of the code already to take a look at it.  It's quite nicely written and as such is pretty understandable for such a complex project.
