I never knew, but the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/default.aspx">Visual C++ Team has a blog</a>.

One post piqued my interest - updates to MFC...  In the new version of MFC they are planning to allow the use of Vista style file open dialogs.  You can read the post <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2006/12/14/vista-style-file-dialogs-with-mfc.aspx">here</a>.

This is good that extra functionality is being added to MFC since so many projects are no doubt saddled with legacy code.  It'll make it fairly easy to get an integrated look without too much hassle.  This is apparently available through the Visual Studio Orcas builds.
