Version [2.7 of WordPress][1] was just released, and being a bit fast on the draw I decided to install it. Using the Instant Upgrade plug-in it upgraded flawlessly as far as I can tell (cue the entire website imploding).

This upgrade breaks quite a few plugins because they are no longer necessary like the one I used to give the admin interface drop down menus.

The new administrative interface is good looking and well thought out. There are also plenty of [new features][2].

So, if you see anything broken &#8211; let me know.
