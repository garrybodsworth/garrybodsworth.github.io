[The Singapore Grand Prix][1]  
Absolutely stunning imagery from the Singapore night-time grand prix.

[GIMP 2.6 Released][2]  
The new version of GIMP has been released. It has the beginnings of the [GEGL][3] integration which is very exciting for the future of the image manipulator. I don&#8217;t care what anyone says it is a great tool and I have produced print and web images with it.

[Git User&#8217;s Survey 2008][4]  
Help make Git better.

[Stainless][5]  
A Google Chrome inspired browser for the Mac.

[Imendio Laboratories][6]  
Imendio are heavily involved in the development of GTK+ and they now have an open-source portal for their projects. One of their major contributions is the GTK+ OSX integration.

[Introducing Top Draw][7]  
Procedural image generation in Javascript. Looks like the images are very Jeff Minter-ish.

[X86 SBCs run Linux][8]  
Yet another small single board computer capable of running Linux.
