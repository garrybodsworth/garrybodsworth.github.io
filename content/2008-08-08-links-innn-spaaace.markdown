Space effects, non-competes blown to smithereens, more mini-computers, a world where films are more entertaining, and something you should read about the history of the personal computer.

[50 Photoshop Tutorials For Sky and Space Effects][1]  
Because you never know when you&#8217;ll need a picture of the sky that looks better than the real thing.

[State Supreme Court rejects noncompete clauses][2]  
Finally somewhere (California, USA) says non-compete clauses are unlawful. Brilliant. I hope that the rest of the world follows suit.

[Tiny, 6-chip ‘open’ computer runs Linux][3]  
Mini-computers are all the rage at the moment. This one looks like a nice hackable platform (and it is yet another ARM based one).

[The Parallel Universe Film Guide][4]  
It&#8217;s a damn sight more entertaining than the real world of cinema (and is much funnier).

[Carmack on Doom, Rage, EA and More][5]  
The one man programming army gives more hints about future Id products.

[Forgotten PC history: The true origins of the personal computer][6]  
Shedding some light on the history of the PC and revealing some truths.

[Plex &#8211; Media Centre For Linux][7]  
Plex have joined forces with [Centerstage][8] to create a comprehensive media centre solution. This means you now get a flashy UI with the X-Box Media Centre back-end.

[WordPress WPTouch Theme][9]  
Helps to make blogs easier to read on the iPhone and also look pretty integrated.

[WordPress Twitter Plug-in][10]  
Two way integration for WordPress blogs and Twitter which looks really useful. Maybe I should go that route for links?
