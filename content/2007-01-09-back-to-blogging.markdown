After a nice vacation I think it is time to get back to blogging.  I managed to completely miss I posted my 100th entry last year as well.

For this year though, looking ahead...

More on my journey through the land on Windows Vista.  Much more on GUI toolkits.  An updated Subversion toolbar for Visual Studio 2005.  More open-source software that catches my fancy.  One of the things I'd like to look at more closely is KDE4 because there has been a flurry of recent information.  Hopefully, providing my wife will let me, I'll be getting a new Mac, so hopefully I can wax lyrical about some splendid Apple products.

There is probably loads more I can't think of thanks to having a break from computers, but I will be aiming to keep up the post a day average.
