This post is just going to be a collection of links to interesting resources and papers on programming, mostly to do with C++.

First up some interesting papers on programming in gerneral.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Notes on Foundations of Programming</span> by Alex Stepanov and Mat Marcus - you can read <a href="http://www.stepanovpapers.com/PAM.pdf">Part 1 here</a> and <a href="http://www.stepanovpapers.com/FOP2.pdf">Part 2 here</a>.

Next up there is the <a href="http://erdani.org/publications/main.html">papers of Andrei Alexandrescu</a> the template and modern C++ specialist.  He also started the <a href="http://loki-lib.sourceforge.net/">Loki library</a> as a by-product of his books which is a collection of C++ classes for useful things.

<a href="http://mypage.bluewin.ch/yuppi/links/cheatsheets.html">Cheatsheets and reference</a> is a collection of useful links for web programmers (there are some other more general programming links like Python and C++).

For the beginners out there here is a link to a <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">C++ tutorial</a> which is quite well presented.

A good resource for peer-reviewed C++ articles is the <a href="http://www.artima.com/cppsource">C++ Source</a> although there isn't a massive amount of recent content.
