There is now a <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/qt">Qt</a> integration into <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> provided by the good folks at Trolltech.

You can check out the press release <a href="http://trolltech.com/company/newsroom/announcements/press.2007-05-24.8884335791">here</a>.

There is a sneak peak article <a href="http://trolltech.com/company/tt/contents/issue3/eclipse-integration">here</a> and you can download it <a href="http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/eclipse-integration-download">here</a>.  The best thing about it is certainly the integrated form editor.

There is a little run-through/review type thing <a href="http://www.thelins.se/index.php?title=Qt_from_Eclipse">here</a> and even more info <a href="http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2007/07/11/develop-qt-applications-in-eclipse/">here</a>.

Unfortunately I don't think I will ever get to use it in a commercial environment due to the cost, but it could be good to try out for cross-platform development.
