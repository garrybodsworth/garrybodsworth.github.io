And here I am at Europython 2009 in rainy but inhumanly hot Birmingham. I made it for 8am but I am all on my own thanks to a possible hamthrax infected absence.

Interesting stuff from the main introduction. There are over 440 delegates. There are some raffles including the coins designed by Stani using free software. Also they&#8217;re looking for venues for 2011/2012 but it sounds like a hell of a lot of work.

Right, on to my first talk about PyPy.
