Some of you might have noticed that the look of the blog has changed. I can&#8217;t take credit for the design as it is the [blogsimplified theme][1] with the WordPress link [here][2]. I&#8217;ve been looking for a theme that is simple and would allow me to hack the CSS to make it a little different, and this theme fit the bill.

At least it no longer looks like the standard theme and it only took me a couple of months to actually get round to it&#8230;
