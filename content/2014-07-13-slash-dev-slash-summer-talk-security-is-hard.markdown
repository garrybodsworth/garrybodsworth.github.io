Yesterday I did a talk for the [/dev/summer][1] /dev/summer event called "Security Is Hard - I Need A Cheatsheet".  I had a huge amount to cram in 45 minutes.  So much was left on the editing room floor as well.

I've uploaded the talk to [My Github repository - securitytalk2014][2] with both keynote bundle format and a full PDF export of presenter notes as well as slides.

If anyone wants to chat to me about the talk you can get me on Twitter as @garrybodsworth (or the email address in the presentation).
