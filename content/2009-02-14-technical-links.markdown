Lots of links to cool technical things&#8230;.

[Not tested in IE initiative][1]  
Developers are prematurely aged by having to bake in Internet Explorer compatibility, my anecdotal evidence proves this.

[The Photo Marketplace That Never Launched: Flickr Stock][2]  
An interesting article about a photo marketplace by Flickr that never got off the ground.

[Real World Haskell][3]  
The whole book online.

[Linux tablet emerges from blogosphere][4]  
An open-source, openly developed internet tablet. It is a really nice idea to make an internet appliance like this, especially as commercial forces seem uninterested in the device.

[s3fs &#8211; FUSE file system for Amazon S3][5]  
Use Amazon&#8217;s distributed hosting service as a file system. This looks really cool for simplified off-site backup &#8211; I wonder if Time Machine on the Mac could use it&#8230;?

[EAâ€™s Prototyping Framework][6]  
EA have released the source to a rapid prototyping framework for games.

[google.org &#8211; Energy Information][7]  
Use the Google service to monitor your energy consumption. What you need is a special type of meter fitted to your home, it seems the UK is currently [trialling the smart meters][8].

[Programming a 64-bit Operating System][9]  
Information about developing a 64-bit operating system.

[v0.8 of Redmine released][10]  
The Ruby written bug tracking system with bult in wiki, repository integration, and much more has released a new stable version.

[IDE in the cloud: Mozilla Labs&#8217; browser-based IDE prototype][11]  
I see a lot of potential in this idea if it can abstract away the boring mechanics of source control and everything else.

[flashbake][12]  
Source control for writers using Git and Python.

[Make your Ubuntu distro look like the Mini Mi][13]  
Make Ubuntu look like the new [HP developed theme][14].

[First Look: Elive E17 Compiz][15]  
Screenshots of Enlightenment e17 running ecomorph (Compiz).

[get_iplayer &#8211; Download BBC iplayer, BBC Radio & ITV programmes][16]  
Command line tool for iPlayer on Linux.

[Gnome-Do Docky: A New Dock On The Block][17]  
Dock type stuff on GNOME.

[Hands on: Neuros LINK, an Ubuntu-based media extender][18]  
Linux based media centre. Looks quite good for hackers.

[Make Ubiquity Your Ultimate Firefox Commander][19]  
A nice article covering some of the more interesting aspects of Mozilla&#8217;s Ubiquity. Also more info about putting together a [Ubiquity photo editor][20].
