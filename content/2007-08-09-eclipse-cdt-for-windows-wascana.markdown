<a href="http://wascana.sourceforge.net/">Wascana</a> is the name of the CDT for Windows project run by the excellent <a href="http://cdtdoug.blogspot.com/">Doug Schaefer</a>.  It provides an installer with Eclipse, the compiler and loads of exras.  The plan is to create a really good Windows desktop IDE.

Keep an eye on it over the next few weeks as it should be updating to GCC 4.2.1 and some form of <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> support.

Certainly if it all comes together there is a powerful argument to use it instead of Visual Studio.
