<a href="http://www.applegazette.com/mac/rumor-aqua-to-be-replaced-with-illuminous/">Apple Gazette</a> have posted a rumour that the OS X theme Aqua with something new codename Illuminous.  Macs have always had a great looking user interface with a real feeling of weight and it always feels complete and finished.  The rumour states that it is in response to Aero - the Vista UI theme, but I somehow doubt that is the case.  Vista's UI feels confusing, lightweight, unfinished, and lacking consistency.

Apple have put up some developer technology posts for Leopard.  There are currently three parts:<ul><li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/leopard/overview/tools.html">Part 1 - Developer Tools</a></li><li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/leopard/overview/">Part 2 - Technology Overview</a></li><li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/leopard/overview/apptech.html">Part 3 - Application Technologies Overview</a></li></ul>I've got to say it Apple always do a good job with their development documentation, even the promotional fluff.
