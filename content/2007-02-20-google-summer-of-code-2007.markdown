Google have announced <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/02/speaking-of-summer.html">Summer Of Code 2007</a>.

Last year it helped projects get more functionality and encouraged more people to get involved with open-source projects.  They will start taking applications in March, and providing the successful applicants apply themselves well (many find they have to drop out or they are unable to commit anything) there should be a lot of good stuff from it.
