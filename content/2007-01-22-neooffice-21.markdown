In the <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/01/mac-osx.html">previous post</a> I mentioned <a href="http://www.neooffice.org">NeoOffice</a> - the Mac-based version of <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a>.

In the first quarter 2007 there are plans to release version 2.1.  This is going to integrate the changes from OpenOffice 2.0->2.1, which includes new scripting and lots of improvements.  Not only that it will also have support for Office 2007 documents, and execution of VBA scripts in Excel documents.

Overall it looks like NeoOffice is pressing ahead with substantial improvements and features.  It's good to see that Mac OSX has an accomplished office suite outside of Office for Mac.
