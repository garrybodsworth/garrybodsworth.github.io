Since I am so behind the times I finally saw Watchmen the movie today&#8230;. I didn&#8217;t know what to expect because it is a masterpiece of comic storytelling, but there are plenty of reviews out there to tell you whether they liked it or not.

What got me was a small part in the film when Rorschach goes into the bathroom to exact punishment on Big Figure and you can only see what the swinging door lets you. It was a masterful piece of storytelling which lets your imagination conjure up all kinds of terrible deaths. If noone has used this technique of the swinging door in films before then I applaud Zack Snyder for a piece of genuine cinema brilliance.
