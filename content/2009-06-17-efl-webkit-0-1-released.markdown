The first version of [Webkit][1] for [EFL][2] has been [released][3]. I&#8217;ve been tracking the project for quite a while and it&#8217;ll be good to try it out again.

It has support for all the usual features for webkit and also now has plugin support for Flash. There is also a prototype browser called EVE. Internally it uses Cairo for the rendering and libcurl for the networking.

One of the things I really wanted to get round to ding at some point is trying out binding enlightenment (more specifically EFL) to a 3D surface in Clutter, because EFL is really good at 2D (and has plenty of backends) and Clutter is really good at 3D.
