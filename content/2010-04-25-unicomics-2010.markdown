Yesterday at the University of Hertfordshire was the first [Unicon][1] &#8211; the [Unicomics][2] Comic Convention organised by [Danny Graydon][3]. It is the closest comic event to Cambridge I can think of, and it was jam packed with the cream of small-press creators.

So I spent the day strolling around spending money on small press comics and going to panels. Unfortunately the panels I went to were very sparsely attended, but that meant they were more entertaining and interactive.

I thought I&#8217;d do a list of the creator&#8217;s work I picked up since they all produce such fantastic work (and they all have tasters online):

*   [Steve and Chris Denton&#8217;s Massacre and Walking Wounded][4] &#8211; The original zombie nazis comic.Â  Great art and entertainment.
*   [Doug Noble&#8217;s Complex][5] &#8211; which is about scientists trapped in a scientific complex at the end of the world.
*   [Oliver Lambden&#8217;s Bloc][6] &#8211; a silent story filtered through the best of bande desinee.
*   [Daniel Goodbrey and Sean Azzopardi&#8217;s Necessary Monsters][7] &#8211; Monsters and secret agencies.
*   [Paul Rainey&#8217;s There&#8217;s No Time Like The Present][8]
*   [Andrew Cheverton and Tim Keable&#8217;s West: Justice][9] &#8211; A beautiful hardcover western book
*   [Joe Decie&#8217;s What I Drew][10] &#8211; Truth and lies in comics form
*   [George Beedham&#8217;s Jambo][11] &#8211; The UK&#8217;s premiere jam based superhero.
*   [Paper Science][12] &#8211; It&#8217;s newspaper shaped but full of comics.

Fingers crossed there is another one of these events next year, it was very well organised and deserves a bigger turnout.
