I did start to write a post about my enthusiasm for technology, and more specifically how using Macs and the iPhone has been generally a pleasure. Then I suffered from the [iBrick upgrade][1] for my iPhone and got all depressed&#8230;

After persevering for several attempts, the upgrade took, and then all of the frustrations melted away. This upgrade adds massive value to the iPhone hardware I got last October. It&#8217;s not often you can say this about a phone.

One of the features I discovered this weekend whilst taking photos at the [Chelmsford Beer Festival][2] was geotagging. Now I know where I took photos which was particularly useful for documenting how someone had crashed their Subaru on a straight bit of road and wedged itself between a fence and a bollard.

But the reason I was so looking forward to the upgrade was getting my hands on some of the applications now available.

First up I got Super Monkey Ball which I suck at. It&#8217;s got amazing graphics and the right controller experience using the accelerometers, but I am useless at it. It&#8217;s definitely the big name game of the initial line-up.

Secondly I got a puzzler called Trism which is a nice and sedate game. I find it a pick up and play type game, so I can have a quick blast when I have a few spare minutes. Also, it is possible to pretend playing puzzle games improves your brain.

Finally, Super Monkey Ball may be the big name, but the best game out for the iPhone is Bejeweled. The controls work perfectly on the touch screen whether you are a double-tap or dragging player. Given the size of the images you&#8217;d expect to make lots of mistakes, but it is perfect, I have not hit a single wrong gem. The music is good and the graphics look as good as running on a desktop machine.

What I have noticed is now I have played some games the battery will get chomped through a lot faster than when I was only listening to music or leaving it in my pocket.
