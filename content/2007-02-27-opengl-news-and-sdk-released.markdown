Volume 3 of the <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> has been released, <a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/vol003/">read it here</a>.

In this volume there is a lot of good stuff.  There is more about the OpenGL process, information about OpenGL ES (the embedded platform), a look at the OpenGL SDK, and plenty more.

The OpenGL SDK has been <a href="http://www.opengl.org/sdk/">released here</a>.  It is not an SDK in a traditional sense but a collection of third-party constributions.  It contains documentation, libraries, tutorials, and tools.
