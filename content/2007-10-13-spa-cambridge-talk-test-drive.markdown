After an extended summer break the <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">SPA Cambridge talks</a> are back.  A change of venue to Anglia Ruskin University has now happened which is much better due to close vicinity to many pubs which was a problem with the Microsoft Research venue.  Thee events are organised by Mark Dalgarno and you can <a href="http://blog.software-acumen.com/">read his blog here</a>.

This month's talk was about Test Driven Development by Ivan Moore.  It was an interactive session requiring a laptop and Eclipse.  Unfortunately I discovered I must have the only copy of Eclipse in existence not set up for Java development (I have used it for Python and C/C++) a bit too late to rectify that.

The exercise was to solve a blocks world problem with test driven development.  We used Java and JMock for this.  I also got to show my Java ineptitude since I haven't used it for 7 years properly, so I was learning on the fly.  To be honest now I go back to Java it is a lot more inelegant than I remember.  At least after all that I managed to get the tests to pass...

The interactive sessions are a bit more fun when you are sharing a computer, especially when all three of us huddled around it have very little practical Java experience.

The next <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">talk will be from Ian Griffiths about WPF</a> (Windows Presentation Foundation) on the 14th November.
