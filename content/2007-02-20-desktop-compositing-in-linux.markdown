The desktop compositing situation in Linux is moving pretty fast.  Compiz is the base, but Beryl, a branch of Compiz, is the one getting a lot of coverage mainly due to its speed of development.

There is an <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=17296">update about Compiz/Beryl from xdevconf07</a> about their relationship.

Additionally there is a variety of articles about some <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=17305">additional usability features</a> in Beryl.
