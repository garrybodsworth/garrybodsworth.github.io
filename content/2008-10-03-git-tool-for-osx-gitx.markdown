There is a new [Git][1] tool out there for the Mac called [GitX][2]. It is a history viewer with a nice looking Aqua interface which makes a welcome change from the look of Gitk. It probably doesn&#8217;t quite reach [qgit][3] but that website has been very quiet for quite a while.

GitX has the following features:

*   Show pretty information for any revision
*   Fast
*   Nice Aqua interface
*   Quickly search for any commit subject / author
*   Explore tree of any revision
*   QuickLook any file in any revision
*   Double click any file or directory in a tree to open that version
*   Auto-updates

I hope that there is at least one fully featured UI for Git eventually that compares to TortoiseSVN because it will make my life a lot easier. This looks like a very string start for the Mac though, although there are loads of UIs out there being developed, but they all normally use different ways of building their own porcelains.
