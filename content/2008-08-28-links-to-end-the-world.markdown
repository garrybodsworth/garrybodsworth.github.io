[The 5 Scientific Experiments Most Likely to End the World][1]  
Just to be a bit paranoid when the [Large Hadron Collider][2] is about to go online.

[The State of the Language: An Interview with Bjarne Stroustrup][3]  
More about C++, its past and its future.

[Open-source gaming goes commercial with Wiz handheld][4]  
Another example of Gamepark Holding&#8217;s handheld gaming devices. There is a great [online community][5] and it has support for loads of emulators mainly thanks to their previous device the GP2X. The Wiz will have an ARM9 533MHz and a 3D accelerator, so it will definitely be able to cope with what will get thrown at it (especially when you consider the GP2X had dual 200MHz processors).

[Repeat tests show iPhone 3G doesn&#8217;t suffer from faulty hardware][6]  
Because real evidence should really trump hearsay and gut feeling.

[TouchKit: Open Source Multi-Touch][7]  
Make your own multi-touch device, with software and the hardware kit. If you are a bit technically able you could create yourself a cool piece of kit.

[20Q The Simpsons Edition][8]  
One Christmas I spent ages trying to see how good one of the 20Q toys was at guessing what I was thinking and I even went so far as to think of &#8220;corpse&#8221; and it came up with &#8220;cadaver&#8221;. With the Simpsons being a slightly smaller search space I can&#8217;t imagine it ever getting any answer wrong.

[Picwing intros social digital picture frame][9]  
A Linux-based computer in a picture frame for digital content, currently in [beta][10].

[IOGEAR&#8217;s Wireless USB to VGA kit extends your monitor sans wires][11]  
I guess this might have something to do with [DisplayLink][12]&#8230;

[Will “TV Widgets” Change the Way You Watch TV?][13]  
It&#8217;s amazing it has taken them this long to realise the whole TV channel does not have to be delivered over the Internet, but you can augment it with widgets. It&#8217;ll just be something else to adblock.

[10 Most Beautiful Plasma Themes for KDE 4 Desktop][14]  
Linux and KDE together looking good.
