Sun have just released a [new version][1] of their open-source virtualisation software, [VirtualBox][2]. For a free tool I think it is pretty great, especially with its very decent user interface on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

The new features for version 2.0 include 64-bit guest support, native OSX user interface, a Qt4 interface, and even a Python programming interface (on Linux and Solaris currently). This release seems a good step forward for the Mac version, so I can play around with VMs on my home computer without needing to spend money on Parallels.

It&#8217;s free, open-source, and does virtualisation, you can&#8217;t complain about having three buzzwords in one sentence <img src='http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />
