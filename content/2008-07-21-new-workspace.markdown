It was my first day at [Camvine][1] today. I thought I&#8217;d show my new set-up since I am very happy with it (although I will work out the best configuration for me as time goes on).

I&#8217;ve got myself a Macbook (with keyboard and Mighty Mouse), but the monitor is the interesting part. It&#8217;s a 24 inch monitor with a resolution of 1920&#215;1200, but it only cost Â£200 from [Dabs][2]. It&#8217;s amazing how cheap technology is getting nowadays&#8230;
