<span style="font-weight:bold;">UPDATED</span>

Damn, I wake up this morning and switch on the computer to discover that AVG are discontinuing the <a href="http://free.grisoft.com/">free edition of their anti-virus suite</a> as of January 2007.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">START UPDATE</span><br />Well, the message as it turns out was a bit misleading.  They are discontinuing 7.1 free edition and are advising the users to update to 7.5 which is still free.  Click the link in the first paragraph to download - incidentally it uses <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> for its user interface.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">END UPDATE</span>

It has been a fairly decent product, especially for the price, and has meant that I don't have to install one of the myriad of Norton Security packages that I own (normally given away free with computer parts).  I suppose I could go and install those, but I am not really pleased with the software when I have used it.  Mainly due to <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> AVG Free Edition has only spotted one virus attempting to get on my PC in the past few years - and this is definitely not from being a poor anti-virus.

Anyway here is a list of free alternatives for all of you in the same position:<br /><ul><li>It seems <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html">Avast</a> is the most fully featured and professional program you could choose.</li><li><a href="http://www.free-av.com/">Avira AntiVir</a> is also a well respected free anti-virus alternative.</li><li>And now an open-source alternative:</li><li><a href="http://www.clamwin.com/">Clamwin</a> - A free open-source anti-virus engine. It is a static scanner... but pair it up with...</li><li><a href="http://winpooch.free.fr/">WinPooch</a> is a dynamic monitoring engine that you can use with ClamWin which gives you all the benefits of dynamic monitoring.</li></ul><br />Well, that is at least a list to be getting on with.  Or you could believe <a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Allchin_Suggests_Vista_Wont_Need_Antivirus/1163104965">Microsoft's Jim Allchin that you do not need Anti-virus in Windows Vista</a>...
