A while back I used to do a lot of illustration, and I just realised that hardly any of it is out there on the Internet any more. So I&#8217;ll be posting some of it interspersed with my usual developer ramblings.

This post is for an illustration that ended up on the back cover of **Transformers: Alignment Volume 1** which was a special story bookending the Transformers comics mythos written by Simon Furman. This magazine was designed by [Graham Thomson][1] and was an exclusive for [Transforce 2001 run by Paul Cannon][2].

I&#8217;ve put up two versions &#8211; one has a simplified background which I think looks much less cluttered, but the WarWorlds you can see flying through space are part of the story. I&#8217;ll scan in the original black and white image as well to show some of the process in the colouring when I can find an A3 scanner. The images on Flickr are 1600&#215;1200.

The image was inspired by this passage in the original treatment by Simon Furman:

> Cybertron, three hundred years after Unicron: 
> 
> Much has changed.
> 
> Led by the insane warlord GALVATRON, the Decepticons have built and mobilised a vast fleet of Warworlds; moon-sized ships with awesome destructive firepower. In order to safeguard Cybertron, the Autobots have relocated their world, using technology appropriated from former Decepticon general Jhiaxus to clone other ‘Cybertrons’ from barren, uninhabited (non-metal) worlds. These decoys serve both to mislead and divide the enemy, but new intelligence has led the Decepticon fleet tantalisingly close to the location of the real Cybertron. A massed Autobot armada engages the Decepticons at Pinea Omicron in an attempt to end the conflict once and for all. Huge losses are sustained by both sides, and OPTIMUS PRIME finally destroys Galvatron… but at considerable cost to himself. Severely wounded, his power reserves decimated, he hovers at death’s door and the Autobots place him in protective stasis.
