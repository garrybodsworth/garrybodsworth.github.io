If you want to watch TV from your [XBMC][1] you can use [mythbox][2] to use your XBMC installation as a frontend for MythTV.

What this does is allows you to watch live and time-shifted television as well as schedule recordings. MythTV is a bit of a pain to set up but once the backend is fully configured then you shouldn&#8217;t need to touch it. The best part for me was the web interface for scheduling recordings because it can show much more information than a TV interface would normally allow.

The quality of the XBMC frontend is much better than the default one that comes with MythTV (which I found counter-intuitive and lacking). The UI for mythbox integrates perfectly and formats everything professionally. The [screenshots][3] are pretty representative of what you get. There have been a few more beta releases since the one I used but even for pre-release software I found it good enough to use every day.

I used this combination for a while, and the only thing lacking for me was the hardware. Otherwise the experience was extremely good. Also don&#8217;t forget if you have nVidia graphics then you get VDPAU acceleration which meant my CPU was not really going much higher than 20%.
