Ubuntu is essentially a layer of abstraction on Debian providing additional stability and usability (niceties I would probably call them) in order to make a public release. Even with this additional layer of checking and development work it is targeted at a specific market and platform. It should work on all computers in a manner of speaking, and it is almost impossible to check all hardware combinations, let alone software packages.

Then you use this already abstracted layer as the basis for an even more specific &#8220;distribution&#8221;&#8230;. When you can limit your hardware targets, you then have to make sure the software is really performant and solid on it.

As the problems become smaller in the grand scheme of things, progress fixing them takes longer, seeming to almost grind to a halt. It also depends on the software you use which uncover bugs in seemingly unrelated libraries, drivers and processes. I&#8217;ve been encountering a lot of these, but this is the wonder of open-source. Solving all of these problems was possible with enough graft because all of the elements were available. This means identifying and communicating with the right communities, and then if you have any fixes getting your changes upstream into their repositories. The problem is though you still have to maintain your own patches because of the trickle down between distributions can take a very long time, and good changes rarely make it into already released software because of the big-bang big-release mentatility. As I have played more I find myself wishing for a rolling release distro&#8230;

But once you have your shiny platform all in place &#8211; how do you keep it up to date. You always find in the pursuit of getting it functioning you have to update manually&#8230;.
