**Computery Stuff**

[The Nintendo gaming world awaits another Mario][1]  
Shigeru Miyamoto&#8217;s hobbies are now top secret because it influences his choice of games to develop. Kind of suggests games development should look outside of its own insular little world of first-person shooters.

[Turn Your iPhone into a Barcode Scanner with ScanLife’s App][2]  
Barcode scanning on the iPhone &#8211; could have some interesting applications.

[Interview with Andrew Tanenbaum, Creator of MINIX][3]  
Does exactly what it says on the tin.

[OpenGL 3.1 promise follows gamer revolt][4]  
I&#8217;m left thinking if some people are so narced by all of this why don&#8217;t they get involved in the process rather than shouting into the ether? Looking at the [Khronos][5] membership I guess they think it is somebody else&#8217;s problem.

[12 Unit Testing Tips for Software Engineers][6]  
I don&#8217;t know about the concurrent code one, see [here][7] for a good write up and solutions.

[Intel releases USB 3.0 controller interface spec][8]  
Should be interesting to see how [DisplayLink][9] exploit the extra bandwidth.

[Tcl/Tk &#8211; Recent Advances][10]  
Tcl/Tk gets theming and so has progressed rapidly in the looks department which is good news for anyone who uses the Git UIs.

[Firefox 3.1 For Developers][11]  
3.1 gives us support for the audio and video tags.

[iPhone Safari Flick Navigation By Example][12]  
The iPhone flick interface in pure CSS.

**Development Applications**

[Editra][13]  
A cross-platform text editor that has support for loads of languages (and even with support for more esoteric stuff like Django templates).

**The Business Of Takeovers**

[Big companies are where small companies go to die][14]  
It&#8217;s all true I tells ya!

**Apple And Designing Stuff**

[How Apple Does It][15]  
A bit of an old article about how Apple approach design and engineering. This segues into the next couple of links:  
[The Great Divide][16]  
[Why Apple doesn’t do “Concept Products”][17]

**Creative**

[Bryan Talbot&#8217;s Grandville][18]  
Images from Bryan Talbot&#8217;s (one of the most talented comics creators on the planet) upcoming graphic novel Grandville. His [Alice In Sunderland][19] is a masterclass in graphics storytelling (in fact anything he has done).

**Random Junk**

[Google Will Eat Itself][20]

> We generate money by serving Google text advertisments on a network of hidden Websites. With this money we automatically buy Google shares. We buy Google via their own advertisment! Google eats itself &#8211; but in the end &#8220;we&#8221; own it!

This may take some time&#8230;

[Darth Thriller][21]  
Michael Jackson + Darth Vader = Funky Moves
