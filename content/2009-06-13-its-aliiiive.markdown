This poor corner of the Internet has been neglected of late, and it is almost time for me to renew my domain. So I have two options &#8211; let it die or pull my finger out and actually post some content. Inbetween [work][1] and a new baby I find spare time a bit scarce (or non-existent).

But the doors won&#8217;t be shutting here because at some point the baby has to sleep at some point in the future and that means I get to use my laptop.
