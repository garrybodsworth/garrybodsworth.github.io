Volume 4 of the <a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/vol004/">OpenGL Pipeline Newsletter</a> is now available.

It goes into more detail about the new OpenGL API on the horizon "Longs Peak".  OpenGL ES2.0 with shader support has now been released.  Also there is an article about the gdeBugger debugger for OpenGL.

The new API looks very interesting, but I'll reserve judgment until I can have a go with it.
