The most exciting thing for me about the new [MacBooks][1] announced today is seeing the manufacturing process. You can watch the [video here][2].

You see I used to write software that did exactly that kind of machining up until about 10 months ago. [CAM][3] programming is not for the faint-hearted. Seeing proper videos online of what CAM software actually does is something of a rarity since most CAD/CAM companies obfuscate their online presence.

In the video you can see lots of liquid coolant being pumped onto the solid block whilst the cutter does the hard work. I&#8217;m just wondering what software is being used to create the toolpaths, especially since there are only a handful of packages capable of doing it, as well as a lot of them use the same algorithms internally. In fact whoever&#8217;s software is doing it should be shouting it from the rooftops, its the closest thing the CAM industry has had to publicity

When you see the &#8220;back&#8221; of the laptop shell you can see the toolpath&#8217;s route around the job. It seems to have a large stepover (the gap between paths). I&#8217;d be interested to know how long each one takes to run the toolpath because [I know someone][4] who is really good at writing this type of software. I&#8217;d also be interested to know whether the software I used to work on would have done the job.
