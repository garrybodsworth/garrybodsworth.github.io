I got to thinking this week, surely there are some computer groups or societies in my area (hopefully filled with people I could learn from).  So off to Google I went and started to search.  I found a couple that looked interesting, although not completely limited to the Cambridge area.<ul><li><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">SPA Cambridge</a> (Software Practice Advancement) - the Cambridge branch of an offshoot of the BCS.  They have monthly talks held at Microsoft Research.  Looks interesting and I think I might check it out.  Here are links for the main <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/">BCS SPA Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.bcs.org/">BCS</a> itself.</li><li><a href="http://accu.org/">ACCU</a> looks like a really interesting group for software development with plenty of focus on C++ in the newsletter archive.</li><li><a href="http://www.camring.ucam.org/">Cambridge Computer Lab Ring</a>.  It aims to build a community in Cambridge based computing.</li><li>There is a <a href="http://www.cambridge-lug.org/">Cambridge Linux Users Group</a>.  Could be interesting for a Linux look at things.</li><li>A user interface focussed group called <a href="http://ukupa.org.uk/">Usability Professionals' Association UK Chapter</a>.  There is an area group - <a href="http://www.ukupa.org.uk/cambridge/">The Cambridge Usability Group</a>.</li><li>There is the <a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/">Code Generation Conference</a> in Cambridge this year.  Also there is an <a href="http://www.international-lisp-conference.org/2007/index">International Lisp Conference</a>.</li><li><a href="http://www.cambridge3g.com/">Cambridge Wireless</a> is a group focussed obviously on wireless stuff with plenty of events.</li><li>A more business focussed group - <a href="http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/">The Cambridge Network</a>.</li></ul>The problem with loads of the conferences is that they are normally very expensive (fine if your work is interested in sending you).  But the SPA Cambridge meetings are free, so I will definitely have to go as there is no excuse (and it looks like I missed some interesting ones in the past year).
