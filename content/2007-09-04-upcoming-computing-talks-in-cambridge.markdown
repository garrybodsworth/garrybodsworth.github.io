There are a couple of talks coming up in Cambridge in the next couple of weeks.  We're lucky here in Cambridge that there is anything like this to go to as I can't find many instances of this throughout the country.

First up we have <a href="http://accu.org">ACCU</a> a group striving for professionalism in programming (and there is a fair amount of emphasis on C++).  They have journals released regularly throughout the year which makes membership pretty worthwhile (also membership gives you access to the entire archive online).

7:00pm Thursday 6th September 2007 - Peter Smith: The Missing Link, the role of a linker within a software development.  You can sign up to the talk at this <a href="http://www.accu.org/index.php/accu_branches/accu_cambridge">link</a>.

Next up is the BCS SPA are going to start there monthly talk programme again after a summer break.  At the moment the talk next week is not known but you can keep an eye out <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SPACambridgeEveningMeetingProgramme">here</a>.

Interestingly there will be a talk from <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">Ian Griffiths</a> about WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) on the 14th November.  He is one of the architects behind the whole new graphics interface in Vista.
