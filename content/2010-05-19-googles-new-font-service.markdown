At [Camvine][1] I spent a small amount of time recently making sure [TypeKit][2] works, so we can use funky fonts in our [WebKit][3] based browser.

Now Google have announced the [Google Web Font API and the Google Web Font Directory][4]. The API webpage is [here][5].

You can view the available fonts [here][6]. Not a huge amount or anything but f it catches on it could explode very quickly.

What with Google pushing 3D web, video, geolocation, fonts, app store, online collaboration (opening up Wave to all), and god knows what else I think they are heading towards completely closing the loop functionality-wise. As far as I can tell you can actually make commercial use of some of these APIs now whereas you were completely unable to do so legally before.
