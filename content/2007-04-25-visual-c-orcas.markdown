Recently public betas for the next version of Visual Studio.NET Orcas (v9.0) were made available.  It is possible to get hold of the free Express versions.

You can download Visual C++ Orcas <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/future/visualc/default.aspx">here</a>.  And all the other Express versions can be accessed <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/future/">here</a>.

The C++ compiler with Orcas is a bug fix of the one available with v8.0 (fixing over 180 bugs).  The new rewritten compiler will be available in the version after Orcas.
