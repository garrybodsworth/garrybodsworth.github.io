Welcome to the Programmer&#8217;s Log (although I do wonder if it should be called Programmer Slog).

This is really a continuation of my previous blog [Garry&#8217;s Bit Patterns][1], but using WordPress, and on my own domain. I did consider importing all of the articles but it is best to start anew. The best content (like the TortoiseSVN Visual Studio integration) will make its way here.

Hopefully I will also be joined by some other programmers who slave at the coal face of day-to-day development, to share some of their pearls of wisdom.

I&#8217;m looking forward to doing some WordPress hacking (expect a few posts about that) and some more artistic designing endeavours. Also expect me to try some web hackery now I have a server to play with &#8211; and I need to get my money&#8217;s worth.

Thanks for reading,  
Garry
