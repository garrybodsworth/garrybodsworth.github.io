Recently there has been a wealth of information about <a href="http://wiki.kde.org/tiki-index.php?page=KDE4">KDE4</a> which is going to be the new version based on <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/whatsnew">Qt4</a> with loads of new technologies.  I thought I'd put all of the recent good links into one handy place.

KDE in Suse Linux 10.2 is reviewed <a href="http://blogbeebe.blogspot.com/2006/12/suse-102-part-3-looking-at-kde.html">here</a>.  It has some really impressive screenshots of version 3.5 which doesn't even have the splendid new features.  It features the new start menu type thing called <a href="http://home.kde.org/~binner/kickoff/sneak_preview.html">Kickoff</a>, check out the link to see it animated.

Bizarrely what kicked off this wealth of information about the progress of KDE4 was someone making a blog post saying there was no progress and no future progress in desktop Linux.  It was completely misguided, but it started an avalanche waking up a dozing beast, one of the KDE developers made this <a href="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2006/12/website-does-not-make-you-smart.html">post</a>.

A list of features targeted at KDE4 can be viewed <a href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2007/01/sneek-preview-of-expected-features-in.html">here</a>.

There is an article about the SVG rendering in applications <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1167723426/">here</a>.

You can view an article about the KOffice 2.0 technologies <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1168284615/">here</a>.

There is now a proper installer for running KDE on Windows seamlessly.  This is detailed in <a href="http://commit-digest.org/issues/2007-01-14/">this article</a>.  Also there is now KDE for Mac (so it integrates properly into OSX and not like those X11 applications).  There is some coverage of this <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1168899755/">here</a>.  Both of these are possible thanks to Qt being GPL on both platforms now at version 4.

Finally there is an article about the new <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1169588301/">job progress user interface</a>.  It looks like it could be quite useful.

Overall, exciting times are ahead for KDE and the Linux desktop.
