The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> IDE (which is cross-platform and designed to have plug-ins written for) has a good C++ module called <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">CDT</a> (C/C++ Development Toolkit).

Recently version <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help33/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/concepts/cdt_c_whatsnew.htm">4.0 was released</a> in tandem with the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20070627_europarelease.php">Europa release of Eclipse</a>.  It has been massively improved and gives much better Windows support.

Now the lead developer of CDT, Doug Schaefer, has started a new project called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdt-windows">CDT For Windows</a> which aims to make it obscenely simple to install and run Eclipse+CDT on Windows.  Check out <a href="http://cdtdoug.blogspot.com/2007/06/introducing-cdt-for-windows.html">his post announcing this here</a>.  This is a great step forward and I hope this works out well.
