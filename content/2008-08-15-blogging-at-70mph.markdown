I&#8217;m in a car travelling at 70mph and I can blog (I&#8217;m not driving &#8211; honest). Welcome to the future. I&#8217;m writing this on a 3G iPhone using the WordPress free app.

It&#8217;s nice and simple to use, even offering photoblogging facilities. I like the pared down nature of it because it simply lets you write. It could do with some tweaking in the how to publish or save drafts department though.

All I need now is my jetpack.
