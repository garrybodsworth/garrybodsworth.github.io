Obviously I have been posting recently about the new native code and MFC updates that will be appearing in Visual Studio 2008.  There is now some official news on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/">Visual C++ Team Blog</a>.

You can see the posts here:<br />* <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2007/11/09/announcing-a-major-mfc-update-plus-tr1-support.aspx">Announcing a major MFC update plus TR1 support</a><br />* <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2007/11/09/channel-9-pat-brenner-overview-of-new-mfc-update.aspx">Channel 9: Pat Brenner – Overview of new MFC update</a><br />* <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2007/11/09/hola-from-barcelona-and-welcome-to-a-major-mfc-update.aspx">Hola from Barcelona…and welcome to a major MFC update!</a><br />* <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2007/11/09/quick-tour-of-new-mfc-functionality.aspx">Quick Tour Of New MFC Functionality</a>

In the new year the native code improvements will be in beta and it will all be released in a service pack early next year.  It'll be interesting to see what the code available will actually be like.

Anyway, now I'll be aiming for a change of subject...
