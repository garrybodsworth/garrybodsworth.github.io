I've noticed a few commercial products have released free merge tools recently.  I'll come onto them after the good open-source ones.

I am a massive fan of <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/">KDiff3</a> which provides a very good 3-way merge and has saved my merging hide more times than I can remember.

<a href="http://www.winmerge.org">WinMerge</a> is definitely the slickest merge tool for Windows, unfortunately it is only a two-way merge.

<a href="http://meld.sourceforge.net/">Meld</a> is an excellent system but although it is cross-platform it really excels on GNOME.  The comparison looks great with the two sides connecting up.

And now some commercial ones...

<a href="http://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html">SourceGear DiffMerge 3.0</a> was released recently.  Looks OK as well and it is cross-platform.

The <a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/products/merge.html">Perforce Merge Tool</a> was recently released for free.  It looks really quite good and powerful.
