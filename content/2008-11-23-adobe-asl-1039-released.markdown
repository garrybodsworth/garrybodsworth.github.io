The latest version of the [Adobe ASL][1] open source C++ libraries was released on November 6th. It&#8217;s a great set libraries that give even more functionality beyond even [Boost][2].

The latest version also works with the latest 1.37 release of Boost and even contains the [Intel Threading Building Blocks][3].

Some of the libraries that are really useful are Move (providing move semantics for your classes), copy-on-write (only copy data when you need to, not by default), ABI safe containers, and the Forest container (for hierarchical data).

There are additional presentations and talks available for download [here][4]. They are well worth having a read through as they present some of the concepts used in the ASL and some good insights into C++.
