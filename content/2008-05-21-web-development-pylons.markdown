I was reading some information about <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a> and watching a few of the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/screencasts">screencasts</a> and I was really impressed about how fast you can create a database-backed website.  One of the good blogs about it is <a href="http://afreshcup.com/">A Fresh Cup</a> where a Microsoft refugee embarks on a career in Rails development.  It pointed to a very interesting article <a href="http://glyphobet.net/blog/essay/228">Rubyâ€™s Not Ready</a> whcih compares Ruby to Python.

Through that article I discovered Pyhton has its own "On-Rails" equivalent <a href="http://pylonshq.com/">Pylons</a> for rapid website development.  Since Python resources out there are so numerous this would be a very interesting platform to build on.  I guess that also means for enterprising C++ developers using Boost.Python they could have some interesting performance improvements.

For the most part Pylons seems about as productive as Rails, as outlined in the <a href="http://wiki.pylonshq.com/display/pylonscookbook/Making+a+Pylons+Blog">tutorial for making a quick blog</a>.

It's pretty easy to try this stuff out on a <a href="http://www.macports.org/">Mac</a> if you have MacPorts installed (and <a href="http://porticus.alittledrop.com/">Porticus</a> to make it extra nice).
