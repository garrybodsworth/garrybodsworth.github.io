Some interesting links&#8230;

[The Big X Window Manager Guide (with Screenshots)][1]  
A comprehensive look at window managers for X, with added screenshot goodness.

[Build a Basic Newspaper style layout with WordPress and jQuery][2]  
Mainly because I still haven&#8217;t got round to designing a new look for this blog.

[nVidia releases more GPU Gems 2][3]  
nVidia have started to release more chapters from the GPU Gems 2 book. Well worth it for anyone with an interest in graphics.

[Joel Johnson interviews Syd Mead Part 1][4] and [Part 2][5]  
Aliens, Blade Runner, and Tron are on his CV.

[Watchmen Trailer][6]  
I love the original graphic novel, it is an example of comics doing what other mediums cannot. The story is merely incidental when compared to the craft and knowledge of the comic book page. The film looks like it will at least be entertaining judging by the trailer &#8211; it&#8217;s set in the 80s after all!
