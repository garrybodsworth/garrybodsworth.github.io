<span style="font-weight:bold;">Synopsis</span>

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a platform for building Windows desktop applications that can take full advantage of the graphical capabilities of modern PCs. Whereas many UI frameworks in the past have merely added yet another layer of abstraction on what was there before, WPF is radically different from its predecessors. This talk will discuss what possessed Microsoft to abandon the strategy of incremental tinkering that has served them well for over 20 years of Windows application development. WPF shifts away from many of the fundamental mechanisms that had been in place since the first version of Windows, and we will explore the new possibilities this creates.
