Two weeks ago I attended the latest <a href="http://www.accu.org/index.php/accu_branches/accu_cambridge">ACCU Cambridge meeting</a> called Closing The Case For Groovy presented by Russel Winder.  It was very kindly hosted by <a href="http://www.displaylink.com/">Displaylink</a> again.

This talk was about dynamic languages concentrating mainly on <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>.  It is a dynamic language which is compiled into JVM bytecode meaning it can interact very nicely with Java.  What was particularly refreshing about his talk was Russel not talking about language wars but how they can cooperate together.  Overall the talk was entertaining and informative especially from the point of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)">Closures</a> which I really needed to learn about.

Obviously the pub visit afterwards was essential.

The next talk will be on Thursday 1st November by Allan Kelly.  If you like technology and development and live in or around Cambridge then these talks are essential.
