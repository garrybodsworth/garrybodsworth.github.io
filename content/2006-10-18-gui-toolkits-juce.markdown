On my trawl through GUI toolkits and my general web browsing I have encountered the name <a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/">Juce</a> from time to time.  It's not just a GUI toolkit, it aims to be as comprehensive as possible.

What stopped me from taking a closer look in the past is that it is a non-native UI, but hey, nothing ventured...

It provides excellent support to essentially a vector graphics based user interface.  It seems really solid and smooth.  The library itself was developed for the audio sequencer application <a href="http://www.mackie.com/products/tracktion2/">Tracktion</a>, and looking more closely at this you can see where the library's real power lies.  Providing you don't want a platform standard GUI toolkit UI you are away, like if you wanted a midi sequencing apllication to look like a keyboard not a standard windows dialog based application.  I'm sure it must be possible to apply a Windows XP/Vista theme with enough effort.

Juce is also on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juce">Wikipedia</a> which covers the main points from the website.  I recommend downloading the <a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/download.php">example application</a> the Juce website as it is interesting seeing how it behaves.  I do find it all a little blurry, but I think that is the theme supplied not the toolkit itself.
