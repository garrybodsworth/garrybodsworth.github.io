[Terminator 3 Movie Poster][1]  
Stunning animated movie poster. I think I should say up front that I am one of those people who think the first movie is the best, but robotic killing machines exterminating mankind is quite entertaining. **Updated to the direct link.** You can access the SWF directly [here][2].

[Young Boris!][3]  
Read the comic of the London Mayor&#8217;s younger adventures.

[id Software C++ Coding Conventions][4]  
It&#8217;s always interesting to see how others do it.

[LLVM 2.4 Released][5]  
The latest version of the Low-Level Virtual Machine adds some nice features. The most interesting part is the C/C++ font-end Clang which looks to be moving along very nicely.

[The Parrot VM][6]  
Never heard of it until recently but it is another virtual machine with some large corporate names involved (like the BBC).

[How To: Max Out Apple TV&#8217;s Potential With Boxee ][7]  
I like my media centres and this looks very nice on the little Apple TV.

[Comparison of Python virtual machines][8]  
With all the love going on Javascript in browsers I feel like Python is being neglected&#8230;.

[git-bz: Bugzilla subcommand for Git][9]  
Automate your interactions with Bugzilla when using Git.

[TortoiseHg][10]  
The Mercurial DVCS shell integration is starting to look mature enough now, and it&#8217;s cross platform.

[How-to: USB remote control receiver][11]  
A very interesting and useful hack.

[New MythTV Interface Preview][12]  
MythTV gets a new lick of paint in the new version.

[Toolholder frustrum consolidation shape][13]  
I remember rewriting huge amounts of this type of code (in fact the original one Julian wrote) to make it do more types of shapes and extend it further. He is much better at it than me though!

[Browsershots][14]  
See what the webpage looks like on a myriad of platforms. It&#8217;s open source too.

[40+ Tutorials for Working with Wacom Tablets][15]  
I discovered I am completely useless using a tablet so I guess its pencil and paper for me.

[LIFE photo archive hosted by Google][16]  
An astonishing amount of pictures now available to browse.

[Max Fleischerâ€™s Super Superman Cartoons][17]  
This stunning animation and design is only 60 years old.

[FEMA Firefighters Manual Covers UFO Attacks, Crashes][18]&#8230;  
&#8230;probably in greater detail than things that might actually happen.

[Early Star Wars Storyboards][19]  
Storyboards are great and this set of Star Wars ones look very dynamic. Here is [the Flickr set][20].

[Daily Mirror archive of strips &#8211; all online! ][21]  
What with the [United Features site also going comprehensive and free][22] the amount of quality online comic strips is going through the roof.
