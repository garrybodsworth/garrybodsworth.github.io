There is an interesting talk on Slashdot about coding <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/07/05/30/1813247.shtml">here</a>.  It's good to see that there is still occasionally some discussions about programming on there.

The article is about <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-clear-code/?ca=dgr-FClnxw01linuxcodetips">Six Ways To Write More Comprehensible Code</a>.  It makes size points:<br /><ol><li>Comment well and often.</li><li>Use sensible names not obscure constants.</li><li>Use variables with descriptive names.</li><li>Do error checking.</li><li><a name="N101BF"><span class="atitle">"Premature optimization is the         root of all evil." - Donald Knuth</span></a></li><li><a name="N101BF">Don't be too clever.</a></li></ol>

The article is a nice little bit about writing better code.  Personally I rate number 5 very highly, in fact I should write an article about writing better code from my point of view.
