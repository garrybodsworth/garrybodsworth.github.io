I've been scouring the Internet for the best way to interview C++ developers.  I'm new at the whole process but I do like finding out what other people have learnt, so maybe I can miss out some of the initial mis-steps.

Having technical questions to ask isn't the only part, but I did find some quite intersting C++ ones <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=60273">here</a> and <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=63546">here</a>.  The thing about these questions is that they are more to start a technical discussion than give a 100% accurate answer.

The best resource I found was more discussion based, where people reveal their own techniques to find the right candidates.  It can be read <a href="http://www.artima.com/wbc/interprogP.html">here</a>.
