A new development version of <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> has been released.  This is in a lead up to version 2.8, which will be the latest stable version.

The new version of <a href="http://wxpack.sourceforge.net">wxPack</a> has not been released yet, but the new version will probably be out soon and no doubt feature <a href="http://www.wxformbuilder.org/">wxFormBuilder v3</a> (the new version of a GUI builder).

If you like GUI building in wxWidgets then the 2.7 development codeline actually seems pretty stable from my tests.  If you are currently using 2.6 you are missing out on integrated <a href="http://www.kirix.com/community/wxaui.html">wxAUI</a> (advanced docking and UI kit) and quite a few other improvements.
