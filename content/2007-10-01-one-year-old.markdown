It's hard to believe this blog has been going for one year as of today.  I can't believe I actually remembered this since I never managed to spot my 100th or 200th post.

It has been quite a year really.  NC Graphics were taken over by PTC meaning I am now with a third employer working on the same codebase (in four separate stints).

Certainly the most popular items on the blog have been the <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/07/tortoisesvn-and-visual-studio.html">TortoiseSVN and Visual Studio integration</a> and recently the <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/08/debugging-stlport-in-visual-studio.html">STLPort debugging in Visual Studio</a>.  Thanks to all the readers and all the comments.

I would promise something for the next year or some manifesto, but if it is as action packed as the previous year I somehow doubt I will live up to it.  All I can promise is  if I learn anything interesting about computers I will share it with the rest of the Internet.

Normal service will now resume.
