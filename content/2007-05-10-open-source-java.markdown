<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2127458,00.asp">Sun announced the open-source Java Development Kit</a> recently.  It's under the GPLv2 license and it looks like they want to capture the open-source community.

This could be a really interesting period since Java may start to gain even more traction as more people become involved in its development.  Hopefully meaning slicker VMs being released.

OpenBSD are currently merging this <a href="http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20070508192340">release into their codebase</a>.  I imagine others will not be far behind.  I hope it means that it becomes well supported on many platforms.

You can see the OpenJDK website <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">here</a>.
