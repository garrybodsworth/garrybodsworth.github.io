The <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> distributed source control system has some Google Summer Of Code Projects.  One of which is the Visual Studio integration and recently there has been a status update on the mailing list talking about progress - <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/bazaar/2007q3/027836.html">read it here</a>.

I think the distributed source control system that catches on will probably be the one which manages to get together the best external tools and UI.  Bazaar seems to have a few projects that are actively developed that could deal with that and make it quite a contender.

Part of the development for this project though is wrapping the API in a Microsoft embeddable way.  An interesting approach but I can think of a few other routes.
