I covered <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/07/llvm-low-level-virtual-machine.html">LLVM briefly earlier</a>.  I did mention Apple were working on a new C front-end called Clang.

Now the C front-end has been open-sourced there is a small website for CFE/Clang <a href="http://llvm.org/cfe/">here</a>.

There is a post about it <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2007-July/009817.html">here</a>.  This is a good step in open-source tools, and hopefully will spur other tool developments on.
