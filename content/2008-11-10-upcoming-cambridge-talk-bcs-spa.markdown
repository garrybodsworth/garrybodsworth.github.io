    The BCS SPA Cambridge talks are about to start again running monthly from November through to June. These are computing talks that are free to attend with a light buffet. The talks are also moving back to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge">Microsoft Research Cambridge</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On November 12th at 7pm <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.software-acumen.com/">Mark Dalgarno</a> is doing his talk <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/WhenGoodArchitectureGoesBad">“When Good Architectures Go Bad”</a>.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      As software evolves its architecture ‘as-is’ deviates from its architecture ‘as-hoped-for’ – the software is said to erode.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Software Erosion can be a problem because:<br /> - the time, effort and risk in implementing further changes increases
    </p>
    
    <p>
      - the effect of further changes becomes harder to predict<br /> - further changes typically cause the ‘as-is’ architecture to deviate further from the ‘as-hoped-for’ architecture – the situation becomes worse.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This session looks at examples of software erosion and explores practices to prevent or slow such decay. Participants should come prepared with architectural ‘war stories’. There will be a couple of group exercises but no test at the end.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    This will be a good session to meet other attendees and to tell your war stories and stories of hope (although I think the bad ones are always more entertaining).
