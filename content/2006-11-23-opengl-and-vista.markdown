Well, that was easy.  OpenGL works seamlessly on a composited desktop with DWM.  I am using the nVidia QuadroFX drivers and it seems okay.

Kind of anyway.  Performance is a little off, especially in debug, but this could be related to any number of things.  Also I am getting lots some weird crashes setting OpenGL colours, but that requires more investigation.

Anyway, it was far from worst case scenario.
