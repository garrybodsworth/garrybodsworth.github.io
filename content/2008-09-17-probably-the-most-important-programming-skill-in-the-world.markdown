**Reading Code**

It&#8217;s not something like being able to crank out a million lines of code in a year, or to construct the most complex algorithms. Being able to read and comprehend other people&#8217;s code is the most important skill you could need.

Very rarely do programmers get to work in a bubble where they only have their own code to deal with, and most have to work on a legacy system of some sort. In such an environment you need to be able to understand the code in order to simply fix bugs, let alone being able to evolve and add features to the system and codebase.

It also segues nicely into another bugbear of mine, Not-Invented-Here Syndrome. NIH is really a side-effect of being afraid of other people&#8217;s code, but when you have the ability to read a wide variety of code, bug fixing in those external areas isn&#8217;t so frightening. The benefits definitely outweigh the risks of using externally developed code thanks to it typically having many man-years of development being invested in it, leading to a maturity that would be very difficult to reach when starting from scratch (unless the quality was so bad there is no choice). Stand on the shoulders of giants &#8211; it helps.

Another nice side-effect is it helps you respect other people&#8217;s perspective. All those things that annoy you about understanding other people&#8217;s code, remember them and filter them out in your own code. It will mean other people can use your code more effectively. Consistent formatting (I don&#8217;t care where stuff goes so long as it is sane and consistent &#8211; things like braces in C/C++), easy debugging, useful documentation, reusable functionality, and easy testing, should always be aimed for when creating code. It&#8217;s even best to think that way in private pieces of code because you never know when it will end up being public.
