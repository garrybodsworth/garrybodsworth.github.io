<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> is a popular development platform, kind of more than an IDE.  It is based solely around plug-ins and provides a good development environment.  At the moment most of its strength is the Java development and its use for embedded systems (see my previous article about SunSPOTs - that used the Eclipse IDE for remote debugging.

One of the projects within it I keep an eye on is the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">CDT</a> project which is a plug-in for C/C++ aiming to be as strong as the Java development.  At the moment it is used a lot for the embedded space, but they want to extend it even further and challenge the <br />Visual Studio IDEs.

The guy heading up the CDT project Doug Schaefer has been blogging about the progress of the project for a while.  In the CDT 4.0 roadmap the plan is to use the Windows SDK and have integrated debugging and the suchlike.  His most recent post <a href="http://cdtdoug.blogspot.com/2006/12/migrating-from-visualc-to-cdt.html">"Migrating From Visual C++ to CDT"</a> shows the progress the project is making.  It is always great to have alternatives and Eclipse certainly could help along that route.  Part of the plan is also to add C# support as well from the Windows SDK.  At the moment I would not recommend using CDT in lieu of VS2005 for Windows application development but if your toolchain is make based you may find this a better alternative.
