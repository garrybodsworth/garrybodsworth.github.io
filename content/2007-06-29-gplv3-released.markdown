GPL v3 has been released today.  You can go and read it <a href="http://gplv3.fsf.org/">here</a>.  There is also the FAQ <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">here</a>.  I'm looking forward to seeing its adoption.

In completely unrelated news <a href="http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2114557,00.html">Prince is going to give his new CD away for free</a> with the Sunday Mail (linked to his upcoming 21 Days tour).  I'm a big fan so I will definitely be checking out the new CD.  Unfortunately the music industry is not so happy and are planning to drop him from record stores(!)  The music industry is proving itself completely mad once more.
