The steady stream of information about KDE4 is still flowing.  

There is a new interview with some of the developers porting KDE to Mac and Windows that can be read <a href="http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/79007/index.html">here</a>.  It covers the near future of being able to run KDE applications natively on all three platforms.

There is a small article <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1170113778/">here</a> about some f the education tools to do with graphing and chemistry.

<a href="http://dot.kde.org/1169902218/">KDevelop 3.4 was released</a> recently as well.
