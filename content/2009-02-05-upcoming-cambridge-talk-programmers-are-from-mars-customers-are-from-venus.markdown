It&#8217;s nearly that time of month again (Is it really 2009? Is it really February?) for a [BCS SPA Computing Talk][1]. This month the talk will be about Agile.

[Programmers are from Mars, Customers are from Venus: A Practical Guide to Working with Customers on Agile Projects ][2]  
[Angela Martin][3]

**February 11th 2009, 7:00pm (light buffet) 7:30pm (talk)**  
Venue: [Microsoft Research Centre Cambridge][4]

Customers have one of the most complex and difficult roles on a project, yet XP and Scrum include very few practices that support the Customer in their role. Over the last five years, we have investigated many projects around the world to identify how Customers succeed in this complex and difficult task â€” discovering not what people think should have happened, but what really happened and what actually worked! By the end of this talk you will have gained:

*   A realistic understanding of the complexity and difficulty of the Customer role.
*   An understanding of the key roles required on the Customer team, both what they are and why they matter.
*   An understanding of the eight practices that enable Customers to sustainably drive Agile projects to successful completion.
