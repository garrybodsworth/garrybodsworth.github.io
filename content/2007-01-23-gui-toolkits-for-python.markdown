<a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> is a great interpreted language for either scripting or proper applications, and I've mentioned it a few times in the past, it really is that good.

I came across a great site about <a href="http://www.awaretek.com/toolkits.html">GUI kits for Python</a>.  It gives you suggestions based on your requirements by filling out a mini form.

<a href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python_gui/">PyGUI</a> - It is planned to be a cross platform GUI library implemented specially for Python.  Currently it has Mac OSX Cocoa and X11 using GTK implementations.

<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter">Tkinter</a> - the default GUI installed with Python.  It provides a thin layer to Tcl/Tk.

<a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a> - I have mentioned this a few times already.  It is the Python bindings for <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> making it cross-platform and with a great depth of features.  You can also use a Python written IDE and RAD GUI designer <a href="http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net/">BoaConstructor</a>.

There are many more listed on the page covering the GUI designers as well as the toolkits.
