Just a quick one...  A little while back I briefly <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/gui-toolkits-juce.html">posted</a> about <a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/">JUCE</a> - a different type of GUI toolkit.  The Register has just posted a <a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2006/12/18/juce_cross_platform/">small review of Juce</a> - definitely worth having a quick read.
