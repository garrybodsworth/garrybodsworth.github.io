The <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/">ASL project</a> is run by Adobe where it is an attempt to create a cross-platform GUI library.  It uses pure C++ with many advanced concepts being used.  The GIL (Generic Image Library) part of the project was recently accepted into the <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> project.

The <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">ASL Wiki</a> has a fair amount of interesting information.  On the <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Supplementary_ASL_Documentation">Supplementary Documentation</a> page there is some interesting links, especially the coding guidelines information.

The <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Papers_and_Presentations">Papers and Presentations page</a> has some interesting C++ tidbits.
