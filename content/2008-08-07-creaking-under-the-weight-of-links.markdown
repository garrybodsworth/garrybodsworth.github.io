Lots of links today&#8230;

[Going Rogue][1]  
Why do people leave the safety of a regular wage to go into independent game development? Well, creativity and satisfaction are two good reasons.

[TextMate Plug-in: ProjectPlus][2]  
Interesting plug-in for TextMate which provides extra functionality including some Git support.

[Mozilla Labs >> Concept Series][3]  
Mozilla are attempting to generate more discussion for future directions with the Internet. The [Aurora Concept][4] is generating the most discussion from the design firm [Adaptive Path][5].

[2008 LLVM Developers&#8217; Meeting][6]  
Lots of presentations and videos from the LLVM development meeting. It&#8217;s a great technology and is getting a good ecosystem around it, and when [Clang][7] reaches production state it will be very interesting.

[Mystery Tales No 40][8]  
In Lost there was a brief glimpse of a comic from the 1950s. Some people got hold of it and have scanned it in and analysed it in the context of Lost. But I love Golden Age comics and the scans are fantastic. The creator credits can be read [here][9] and it features Steve Ditko&#8217;s first ever work for Marvel (or Atlas as it was known then).

[New &#8220;Watchmen&#8221; Posters Echo Originals][10]  
These posters are very good. Stuff like this makes me optimistic for the quality, but I can&#8217;t get carried away.

[Organize your PDF library with iTunes][11]  
I never knew you could organise your documents with iTunes&#8230;

[15 Desktop Blogging Tools Reviewed][12]  
I&#8217;ve never used the desktop ones as the web interfaces have been typically more than adequate, and also switching to WordPress from Blogger was a big leap forward.

[Designers on quest to build $12 computer][13]  
Hacking the Nintendo compatible keyboard computer looks like fun.

[The $10 TV Computer Project &#8211; International Development Design Summit 2008][14]  
When $12 is too much.

[Ars Technica Guide to Virtualization: Part I][15]  
A series about virtualisation and what it really means. It made me remember when my brain finally got the concept of virtualisation (see [this old post][16]).

[Video of Cory Doctorow’s talk][17]  
His talk last month in Cambridge is well worth a watch. I definitely need to watch it again as it was so dense in content that I am sure I have missed something.

[No, your code is not so great that it doesn’t need comments][18]  
I like rants that tell you to comment your code. Just because you can understand the intention it does not mean that others will interpret the information in the same fashion.

[Features Planned for WordPress 2.7][19]  
Some interesting possible features for the next version of WordPress. Integrated one-click plug-in installs would definitely be nice, as well as comment threading.

[What if Linux Took a Vista &#8216;Mojave&#8217; Test?][20]  
An obvious question, but Mojave was a marketing tool rather than a clear scientific test.

[Larrabee: Intel&#8217;s biggest leap since the Pentium Pro][21]  
Interestingly it looks like the chip&#8217;s debut will be as an add-in board (a GPU).

[Firefox 3 features you may not know][22]  
The duplicate tab feature by dragging is something I wish I knew about before.

[KDE 4.0 Style Theme for Firefox 3.0][23]  
Make Mozilla Firefox look more integrated into the new version of the KDE.

[Resolution Independent GTK+][24]  
A patch has been submitted that adds resolution independence to the GTK+ toolkit.

[Mozilla Qt Port is available for testing][25]  
A test for the embedding of Mozilla in Qt.

[Songbird 0.7: Big Improvements for the Little Music Player][26]  
Songbird is a great little music player, and they are still adding loads of great features and have completely revamped the UI(!)

[iChm &#8211; CHM Reader For The Mac][27]  
A good looking CHM reader for the Mac when you are stuck with Windows style help files.

[Feedly For Firefox 3][28]  
Feedly attempts to make using your feeds even more fun. I am still playing with it but it looks nice and allows you to Twitter directly from the UI, unfortunately not for WordPress&#8230;

[Microsoft Misses Windows Mobile Sales Target][29]  
Just because&#8230;

[Get Your War On: The Watch List &#8211; Animated Series][30]  
It is so bizarre seeing clip-art come to life&#8230; I thought the comic series was great &#8211; I&#8217;m waiting with baited breath to see if some of the more extreme content makes it.

[Fans spend over £30,000 on Transformers][31]  
I missed out n Auto Assembly this year because of visiting sunny and hot Barcelona but it sounds like it was a success. Congrats to the AA team.

[Hand Drawn Map Association][32]  
I bet someone creates a plug-in for Google Maps to make it all look hand drawn.

[Knights Templar to Vatican: Give us back our assets][33]  
Is 700 years beyond the statute of limitations?

[Cthulhu fonts][34]  
Interesting fonts from The Old Ones.
