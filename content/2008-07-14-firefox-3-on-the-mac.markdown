[Firefox][1] is my browser of choice on the Mac mainly because I can&#8217;t live without my Add-Ons.

To make Firefox more Mac-like I recommend the two following Add-Ons:

*   [GrApple Deicious (Blue)][2] &#8211; Is a theme for Firefox that makes it look very close to Safari. Simply it looks like a Mac application so you never feel you are using an alien environment.
*   [Fission][3] &#8211; This changes the progress bar for loading pages. It changes the look so that the progress is shown in the address bar, which means you can switch off the status bar for an even more Mac-like experience.

Just those two Add-Ons give Firefox 3 a real boost on the Mac (how shallow &#8211; it&#8217;s the surface experience). In Firefox 3 there have been more changes under the bonnet for better Mac integration with native-look widgets and improved rendering.

It&#8217;s not just on Mac the situation is improved, I have been using it on Windows Vista and to sum it up, Firefox 3 is blazingly fast and looks really quite good. The best feature is the improved speed of Javascript which really makes scripting-heavy websites a pleasure to use and you don&#8217;t seem to get the multiple tabs hanging when something complex is trying to happen.
