There is an interesting <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html">article here</a> about the design architecture for GUIs.  This applies more to the rich clients with database backends, but I think it is more than relevant for designing an application as it would be able to scale in the future much more easily.

The obvious subject it covers is MVC (Model-View-Controller).  The article is kept fairly up to date as well with an update the middle of this year.
