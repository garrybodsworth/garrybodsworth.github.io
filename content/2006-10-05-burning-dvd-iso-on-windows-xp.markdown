I started by downloading the Windows SDK, which had a file extension <span style="font-style:italic;">.img</span>.  After a bit of <a href="http://www.google.com">Googling</a> I found out you can just change the extension to <span style="font-style:italic;">.iso</span>.

Now it was time to burn it.  I found out that the ISO Burning Powertoy doesn't work for DVDs.  The software with the DVD drive was so hatefully bad that it was unusable.

So I searched out the burning engine from DVDDecrypter which has been split off by the developer after all the raids and legal ranglings.  Now it is called <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/">ImgBurn</a> and it was a case of choosing the ISO then hitting the big button to burn.  Oh, did I mention it was freeware as well?  Top notch stuff.
