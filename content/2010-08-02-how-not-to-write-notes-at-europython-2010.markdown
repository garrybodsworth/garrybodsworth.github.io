I was told my write-up of Europython was useless without seeing the actual pictures I was drawing when I should have been writing more notes&#8230;. I wasn&#8217;t necessarily bored, just bitten by the drawing bug once again.

First up I started with a simple Optimus Prime to pass the time.

Then Optimus Prime needed someone to fight, so Megatron popped in.

But Megatron was upgraded into the insane killing machine of Galvatron.

Hot Rod (for some reason channelling David Bowie) is needed to keep Galvatron in check.

The chaos bringer Unicron keeps a close eye on testing in planet form.

A tough looking Iron Man decided to get in on the act.

Then we go back to a slightly better rendered Optimus Prime.

A childhood creation of an old friend is Thunder Supreme &#8211; the city robot.

Judge Dredd pronounces sentence on Twisted.

Death&#8217;s Head slightly sketchy, yes?

Death&#8217;s Head II was fighting at keeping Windows at bay. But I fear he may not be powerful enough.
