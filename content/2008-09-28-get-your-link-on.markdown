The unintended side-effect of what you hear on the news is that it has given comedians and satirists (I&#8217;m not entirely sure I should make the distinction) a wealth of new material. Some of it has been pure genius.

[Get Your War On: Bailout?!][1]  
Get Your War On is a fantastic comic strip that has now become a fantastic online animation. Just beware it is not for the young or impressionable or those with a non-extreme sense of humour.

[Sebastopol man puts code manuals online. The operating manual for your government is now more complete..][2]  
The government should really be doing this.

[Ubuntu &#8211; Five-A-Day][3]  
Ubuntu&#8217;s new proactive approach to bug triage and solutions. When these things work it is fantastic. Other ways this type of problem has been approached in the past are Hackfests and The Bug Hunt where everyone just spend s a few weeks working only on solving bugs.

[VLC goes to nine point two][4]  
VLC gets a shiny new Qt interface.

[Operation Foxbook: Livinâ€™ Small With the HP Mini-Note][5]  
More on living in the cloud (I wonder &#8211; does the &#8216;C&#8217; now need to be capitalised?)

[Full Circle Magazine Issue 17][6]  
Free online magazine about Ubuntu. It looks good for beginners with a getting started in C tutorial and a how to use Gimp article.

[The 14 best Linux distros][7]  
Because you can never have too many Linux distro round-ups.

[Want to try GNOME 2.24?][8]  
Download VMs with Gnome 2.24 to try them out. Pair it up with VirtualBox to not need any proprietary software.

[FIRST LOOK: Korg nanoSeries controllers][9]  
Interesting looking new controllers.

[iPhone OBD-II app][10]  
Use your iPhone to monitor your car.

[The Geek Guide to New Fall TV][11]  
There seems to be an American version of the Eleventh Hour. I&#8217;ll probably check that out as I think I was one of the only people in the UK who really quite enjoyed it.

[CR Sunday Feature: The 50 Things That Every Comics Collection Truly Needs][12]  
I&#8217;m ashamed to say I have less than a 50% hit rate here.

[Octobriana &#8211; more incredibly strange comics][13]  
This comic has a strange history of alleged public domain, but was it all a hoax?
