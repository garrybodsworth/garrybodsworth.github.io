A few days ago I mentioned the <a <br />href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/11/windows-vista-new-start-menu.html">Windows Start Menu mess</a>.  I simply wasn't impressed by it (you can also see the link to the Joel on Software blog post about it).

<a href="http://www.drizzle.com/~lettvin/2006/11/windows-shutdown-crapfest.html">Apparently 24 developers got their hands dirty working on this</a>, and it still turned out the way it has.  I still look at the menu that pops up with the restart, etc. and wonder who let it out the door as it is a simple pop-up menu, not really revolutionary, and it doesn't even have associated icons.

All I can say about the turning off scenario is most people know what to do with a TV or DVD player, why is not that simple?
