Microsoft have just released the beta of the Visual Studio 2008 "Feature Pack" which is an update for the C++ portion of the environment.  The main features are substantial updates to MFC and TR1 library support.

<span style="font-style:italic;">The VC++ 2008 MFC libraries have been extended to support creation of applications that have:
    * Office Ribbon style interface
    * Office 2007, Office 2003 and Office XP look and feel
    * Modern Visual Studio-style docking toolbars and panes
    * Fully customizable toolbars and menus
    * A rich set of advanced GUI controls
    * Advanced MDI tabs and groups
    * And much more!

This feature pack also includes an implementation of TR1. Portions of TR1 are scheduled for adoption in the upcoming C++0x standard as the first major addition to the ISO 2003 standard C++ library. Our implementation includes a number of important features such as:
    * Smart pointers
    * Regular expression parsing
    * New containers (tuple, array, unordered set, etc)
    * Sophisticated random number generators
    * Polymorphic function wrappers
    * Type traits
    * And more!

Note: This feature pack does not include C99 compatibility or support for special math functions.</span>

Certainly for anyone maintaining MFC based products it is a free upgrade tot he look and feel of the program with tons of advantages.

Unfortunately it tries to force you to download Silverlight which I have been avoiding like the plague but the attempts to get you to install it from Microsoft are getting more aggressive.
