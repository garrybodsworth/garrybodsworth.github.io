In my job I develop CAM (Computer Aided Machining) software.  To be honest there are very few decent resources on the web for it and it is a very closed development arena.

There are some people out there trying to change this.  There are two developers (who I used to work with) called Julian Todd and Martin Dunschen who believe in open-ness in development.  They have a great little blog <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/index.php">here</a>.  You can also try out the online version of their <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/">machining algorithm</a>.
