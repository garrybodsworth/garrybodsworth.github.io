Vista has a new <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=196902178&cid=RSSfeed_TechWeb">Superprefetch feature</a> which is supposed to help launch applications faster because it is supposed to predict the future.

Essentially it will give a perceived boost in performance to the user by predicting which applications may be run next and prepares for it.

I don't know really whether this is such a great idea - surely it would be better to help developers make applications that load faster rather than trying to paper the cracks?  And surely this will effect processor performance further?

The application I work on loads in less than a second and is usable and can load substantial files of half a gig of compressed data and be ready to work with in under a minute.  Also, because of the multithreading the program is still usable whilst the loading process is going on.
