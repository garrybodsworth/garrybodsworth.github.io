Here is an interesting <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/06/Cpp/">article about C++ in Visual Studio Orcas</a>.  I get the feeling of deja vu from reading something similar...

Anyway some of the C++ stuff...

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Vista styles support.</span>  Lots of work has been done on MFC to make it use the Vista common controls like file open dialogs and the rest.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">New common controls.</span>  New common controls are available like a split button and network addresses and more.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Resource editor.</span>  It has been sorely in need of some work in recent releases and it looks like it will finally have support for 32bit colour images.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">User Access Control.</span>  Some built in support for UAC through the manifests and the suchlike.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Compile in parallel.</span>  The parallel compilation will be ramped up to allow faster builds, which is always useful.</div>
