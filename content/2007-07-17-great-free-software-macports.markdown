Since getting my Macbook Pro one of the most useful pieces of software I have installed is <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>.  It is a port package for OS X which used to be called DarwinPorts, this is package management much like Linux tends to provide.  This makes it easy http://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gifto get updates and manage the software installed.

At the moment it has over 4000 pieces of software available.  It is ultimately how I am running Python, wxPython, Bazaar and Mercurial.

MacPorts has just <a href="http://www.macports.org/?p=60">released version 1.5</a>.  You can see the changelog <a href="http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/macports/browser/tags/release_1_5_0/base/ChangeLog">here</a>.

What makes it particularly nice to use is the excellent Cocoa interface for it called <a href="http://porticus.alittledrop.com/">Porticus</a>.  It makes it all simple and intuitive and wraps up all the major features.
