On Monday I start my new job at [Camvine][1], so I thought I&#8217;d take the opportunity to do some shameless promotion for the company.

The company is about delivering digital information to network connected displays with the flagship product being [CODA][2]. You have CODAlinks which allows you to connect a display to the network. You have the CODAbox which sends data to lots of CODAlinks and lives on the local network. The final piece is the CODA website where you configure the content you want on the screens.

The advantages of this system is that it is better value than similar systems, and you can expand easily with additional CODAlinks. One major feature is that it is nowhere near as power hungry as equivalent systems which is always a good thing. It is simple to set-up, manage and maintain.

And if anyone knows a good [Marketing & Sales Director][3], there is a vacancy going&#8230;
