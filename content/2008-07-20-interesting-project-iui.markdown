I stumbled across [iUI][1] this weekend. It provides a UI for developing iPhone applications that run in MobileSafari that look the same as native iPhone applications.

It provides the following:

*   Create Navigational Menus and iPhone interfaces from standard HTML.
*   Use or knowledge of JavaScript is not required to create basic iPhone pages.
*   Ability to handle phone orientation changes.
*   Provide a more &#8220;iPhone-like&#8221; experience to Web apps (on or off the iPhone).

There is a great introduction blog post from Hoe Hewitt [here][2]. The library provides all the building blocks to get started quickly with some spiffing looking iPhone specific webpages.

On the project page there is a couple of examples including a [Digg Interface][3] and a [music UI sample][4].

On a related note there is an interesting post on iPhone browser performance [here][5].
