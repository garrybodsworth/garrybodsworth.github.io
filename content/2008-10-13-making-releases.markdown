There is a good [blog post by Linus Torvalds about making releases][1]. Making releases is extremely difficult and the last stretch is always the most difficult to make.

The most interesting part is the relative quietness as the release approaches with respect to commits. As you are heading towards something more stable the verification and amount of work to diagnose and repair takes more time. The scary parts sounds like the deluge of commits immediately after of patches held back due to stability and testing.
