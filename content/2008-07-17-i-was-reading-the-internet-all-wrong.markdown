My way of surfing the Internet up until last week was to go through the links in my bookmarks (hosted on [delicious][1]) and see if there was anything I wanted to read. It&#8217;s a very long-winded approach to surfing the Internet that requires knowing what was there before and aso visting sites that have no updates.

On this blog I made sure I had an RSS feed, but rarely used them myself apart from tracking bug reporting system issues and wiki changes&#8230;

Last week I decided to set up [Google Reader][2] with the websites I usually frequent. From that I have discovered there are about 600 articles per day out there that I might possibly be interested in. Now I can keep track of what I have and haven&#8217;t read, but now I need to remember to bookmark the interesting articles.

It&#8217;s bizarre that I have been using the Internet since 1995-ish, and this is now a fundamental change to the way I use it. I suppose this is part of the content aggregation that now defines services on the Internet.
