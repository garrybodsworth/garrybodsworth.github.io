An interesting article that passed my eyes in the past couple of days was <a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/cpu/valve-multicore.ars">this one</a>.  It is about Valve's approach to multithreaded applications, and it seems that they fought against it for as long as they could.  Since I've worked in industry I've worked entirely on mutithreaded applications and this probably is under the coarse grained model, but it looks like the fine grained model is going to get more important in the next few years and it is something we are all going to have to work out.
