The canonical RSS feed for this blog has now moved to [http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/feed/][1].  I was reusing the Feedburners from my previous blogs, but this is now going to be a permanent redirect to the feed URL hosted by this blog only, and should carry on working.  I don't want to rely on teh Feedburner service that has not been updated for a long time and I'm not convinced it will be around forever.

You can also take it from me that it is a vanilla XML file generated by Octopress which means no traffic analysis (in fact this blog doesn't even have any analytics hooked up to it deliberately).

Sorry for any inconvenience!
