After the great games for Linux made easily available in the [Humble Games Bundle][1], games for Linux are definitely looking up.

The good news today is that there has been an announcement in amongst the Mac articles that soon there will be a [Steam client for Linux][2]. A more in-depth article on Phoronix [here][3].

If this works well on the nVidia 9400M (the ION platform) then it would be really interesting to see what this does for ION nettops. In theory for about Â£150 you could have a fully functioning Linux computer with gaming prowess (although obviously most people would prefer consoles for this).
