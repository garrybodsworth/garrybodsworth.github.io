One of the things I really want to check out over the next few weeks are open-source GUI toolkits.  There are quite a few to choose from and I tend to jump from camp-to-camp on a weekly basis as to which one I find the most interesting.<br /><br />Since I am using Visual C++ 2005 Express, the ones I try out fully will be tested and compiled (if indeed a successful compilation is possible) on that platform.<br /><br />The initial ones I have already had a good go at over the past few weeks are <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a>, <a href="http://www.vcf-online.org">Visual Component Framework (VCF)</a>, and <a href="http://www.torjo.com/win32gui/index.html">Win32GUI Generics</a>.  Some others I have been reading about are <a href="http://smartwin.sourceforge.net/">Smartwin++</a>, <a href="http://upp.sourceforge.net/">Ultimate++</a>, <a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a>, and <a href="http://www.fox-toolkit.org/">FOX</a>.<br /><br />Also I want to write up a bit more of a comprehensive howto on Boost Python, as I quite enjoyed playing around with that.
