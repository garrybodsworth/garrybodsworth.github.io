For a new job, a spring clean.  The blog has been renamed [Fragmented Memory][4] with its own domain.

This blog used to be on [Blogger][1] and then [self-hosted Wordpress][2] and then back to [Blogger][1].  In my laziness about renewing the self-hosted solution I lost most of the content, then I found my backup from just before that implosion.

Now I'm joining the cool kids with static blogging using [Octopress][3] (hosted on [Github Pages][5]) and merged all the posts from my Blogger and Wordpress instances.  This actually amounts to 500 posts which I imagine is pretty out of date.  Expect some posts about how to migrate from these in the future.  I'll be spending some time grabbing the images and other content and hosting it correctly.
