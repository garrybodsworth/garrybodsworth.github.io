Martin Kleppmann of [Ept Computing][1] who I met at a [Software East][2] event is setting up a [co-working][3] space in Cambridge.

On [this post][4] are his slides for a presentation he made yesterday for [CamCow][5].

This looks like an absolutely brilliant thing, so if any of you people working in isolation at home in Cambridge and yearn for human interaction this is for you.
