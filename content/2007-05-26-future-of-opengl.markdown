The <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> website has put up links to a couple of articles about the future of OpenGL 2 and 3.

<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=39846">This article</a> covers the next two versions of OpenGL codenamed Longs Peak (2.x) and Mount Evans (3.0).  Longs Peak concentrates on tidying up the current API, whereas Mount Evans is a rework of the API to deal with the newer concepts in 3D technology.  Mount Evans also dels with the unification of OpenGL with its ES version that is used in low powered handheld devices like mobile phones and games consoles.
