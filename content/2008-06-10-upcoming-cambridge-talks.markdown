Tomorrow there is the latest <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">BCS SPA</a> talk in Cambridge.  This month we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency Injection</a> by Stephen Oakman.  If you're in Cambridge and fancy a computer talk with the obligatory pub-based discussion afterwards, give it a go.

Coming up in July <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> is giving a talk in Cambridge called "Life in the Information Economy" as part of the Cambridge Business Lecture series.  You can sign up <a href="http://www.cambridgebusinesslectures.com/cory-doctorow-on-life-in-the-information-economy/">here</a>.

We were totally, 100 percent wrong, and now the worldâ€™s in turmoil because of it. What does a copy-native economy look like?

He's a science fiction author, blogger and journalist.  If you follow <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">BoingBoing.net</a> you'll have read a lot of his stuff.  He makes his books available under the Creative Commons licence and I would consider him one of the foremost thinkers (and doers) in the modern minefield of information and ownership (he was European Affairs Coordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation).

Comics adaptations of his fiction have been made available under the Creative Commons licence.  Follow <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/06/09/my-new-graphic-novel.html">this link</a> for more information.
