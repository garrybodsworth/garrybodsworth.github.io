An interesting new blog is out there about physics-based animation.  You can go and read it <a href="http://animationphysics.wordpress.com/">here</a>.

It is mainly from a gaming perspective but I think that most of the theory can be applied to engineering as well.  A lot of great theory comes out of the gaming arena and they certainly share ideas a lot more than the engineering arena.
