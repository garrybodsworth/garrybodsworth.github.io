At the beginning of this month at [Camvine][1] we released the latest [version of our website][2] and client software for getting digital content onto screens (okay, digital signage).

This month the [Camvine Twitter Feed][3] has been taken over by the development team. Every (working) day this month there will be a tweet showing an interesting and useful application of the [Coda Digital Signage System][4]. Already we have two up with a live Twitter feed display and how to get your web hosted photos onto the screens.

You can follow Camvine on Twitter [here][3].
