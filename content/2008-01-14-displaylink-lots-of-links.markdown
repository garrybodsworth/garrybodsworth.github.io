Working for a new company is weird.  But it is weirder when the week you join the company is getting tons of CES coverage from Las Vegas.  It seems positive on the whole which is great stuff...

I've been using two connected devices on a Windows PC with Vista and it has been working great for development, I really can't notice much difference from connecting to a VGA connector.  At least it makes it easier for people to actually work out the kind of company I am working for ;)
