<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-announce/2007/msg00002.html">GCC 4.2 has now been released</a>.  The biggest feature is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP">OpenMP</a> for C/C++ and Fortran.  You can read the changes <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.2/changes.html">here</a>.

All this means I'll be keeping an eye on <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a> as they should be releasing an update sometime soon.
