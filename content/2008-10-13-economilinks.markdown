[Krugman Wins Economics Nobel][1]  
Probably the only economist&#8217;s books I have ever read. He is an excellent and insightful writer, and can make something that should be boring into something readable.

[50 Beautiful Movie Posters][2]  
I think the older ones look more interesting as the modern ones need a little time to mature and see if they stand the test of time.

[Using Javascript to Fix 12 Common Browser Headaches][3]  
Especially because you can&#8217;t rely on release cycles or people actually upgrading.

[MakeHuman][4]  
A cool human modelling piece of software. I guess it would be defined as a free version of Poser.

[OpenSimulator][5]  
An interesting simulation engine for creating Second Life-alikes. Or maybe even for Sim-alikes&#8230;

[An Interview With Comic Artist Lee Sullivan][6]  
My artistic hero and inspiration when I was a young.
