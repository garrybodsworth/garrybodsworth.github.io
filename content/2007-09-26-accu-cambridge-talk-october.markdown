It's hard to believe it is nearly October.  The bad part is getting older, the better part though is that the ACCU talk is coming up.  See the website <a href="http://www.accu.org/index.php/accu_branches/accu_cambridge">here</a>.

This month is about dynamic languages and is called <span style="font-weight:bold;">"Closing the Case for Groovy (and Ruby, and Python)"</span> by <a href="http://www.russel.org.uk/">Russel Winder</a>.  And apparently there will be a related <a href="http://www.pythonforrookies.org/">book</a> that may or may not be out in time for it.

Hopefully the week after will have the first <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SPACambridgeEveningMeetingProgramme">BCS SPA Cambridge</a> meeting since the summer as well.
