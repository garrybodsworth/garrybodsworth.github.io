A new version of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost Library</a> for C++ has been released.  Version 1.35 adds 12 new libraries as well as the usual improvements and bugfixes.  Also there is a new look website which is a nice looking refinement with better access to the documentation.  Boost is a great addition to any C++ developer's armament.

I think this is also the first release using all their new tools and processes (Subversion, Trac, website and other stuff) so I think it is possible that future releases will be more frequent with this framework in place, because I think the plan was originally to have a release twice a year.  That might mean there is a possibility of the logging library by <a href="http://www.torjo.com">John Torjo</a> being integrated soon as well as some others.

Some of the work brings the current libraries in line with the new C++ TR1 library standard - mainly to do with threads.

The new libraries are:
