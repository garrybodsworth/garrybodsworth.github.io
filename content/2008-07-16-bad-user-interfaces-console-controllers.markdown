I sometimes think its old age or something but I think modern console controllers are completely useless. I played Grand Theft Auto 4 on the X-Box 360 and realised the controller was useless, you had shoulder buttons, shoulder analogue buttons, a direction pad, plenty of buttons, an analogue stick, and buttons in the centre. They are also all laid out for people whose hands and fingers are a certain size. The PS3 is just as guilty with loads of controls and not much design progression from previous generations, I really struggled with first person shooters.

The problem really is that these controllers are trying to solve all eventualities and not sticking to the &#8220;less is more&#8221; convention. When you are what is defined as a hardcore gamer you are used to it and can&#8217;t understand why anyone can&#8217;t pick these controllers up and use them easily. Also games try to use every button because they are there.

The way I see it in the future is that most games will come with their own controllers. This has a two fold effect, firstly the controller represents the way that you want the user to interact with the game and clearly defines the user experience. Secondly, the controller becomes part of the package you are buying, so you are not getting just software which is a way of rhaving an incentive to actually buy the package.

The Nintendo Wii gets so much of this right. The controllers are simple and intuitive and encourage &#8220;casual&#8221; play because you don&#8217;t have to re-wire your brain for a quick play. Also the controllers are multi-paradigm with more than one component, you can use it as a SNES-like controller, you can use an analogue stick, you can use the accelerometers. The other part of this is that the controllers &#8220;dock&#8221;, for instance Mario Kart has a steering wheel you put the Wii controller inside, as does Guitar Her and its ilk. This also dramatically reduces the cost of manufacturing a custom controller.

My favourite controller is [this][1] though&#8230;
