Ah, Intellisense, the bane of all C++ developers.  I can't tell you how many times my Visual Studio has crawled into a hole and refused to get out or how many times the ncb has been corrupted by some arcane behaviour.

But rather than waiting for Visual Studio 2008 for some improvements the Visual Studio team have been good enough to release an interim patch.  You can read about it <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2007/11/12/performance-improvements-in-visual-c.aspx">here</a>.

Hopefully this will make some developer's lives easier.  You can download the patch from <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/Downloads/DownloadDetails.aspx?DownloadID=9436">this link</a>.
