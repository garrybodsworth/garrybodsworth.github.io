From the contents of <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/08/debugging-stlport-in-visual-studio.html">my previous post</a> I have created an autoexp.dat for download (Visual Studio 2005 only).  <a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/autoexp.zip">You can get it here</a>.<br /><br />Simply copy the extracted file into <span style="font-weight:bold;">C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\Packages\Debugger</span><br /><br />Visual Studio 2008 will work if you follow the instructions in my previous post but the autoexp.dat is a bit different between versions.</div>

I am using 5.1.3.  I haven't looked at 5.1.4 yet, but I didn't think the release notes suggested anything major.<BR/><BR/>I know that certainly with older versions it is completely different because of the use of the "priv" namespace.<BR/><BR/>Garry</div>

This used to work for me until I upgraded to 5.1.4. Can you please tell me which version of STLport you're running?<BR/><BR/>Thanks!</div>

Glad you have found it useful.  The map took quite a lot of tweaking to make it work on the code I had written to test it.<BR/><BR/>The STLPort map item pointers seem to be a pair{T1, T2} but it is cast to one pointer.<BR/><BR/>The good thing about this ability to visualise means the only reason to switch to the Microsoft STL is gone ;)</div>

This post was very useful to me. I was considering using the Microsoft STL during debug so that I would have the visualizers available. Now I won't have to suffer through that! Unfortunately, I was unable to get the map visualizer to work properly, but I am sure that with some tinkering that will be resolved.</div>
