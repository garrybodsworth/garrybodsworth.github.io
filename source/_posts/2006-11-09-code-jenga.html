Imagine a game of Jenga except every fourth piece is booby-trapped.<br /><br />Anyone who has worked on a suitably mature commercial codebase knows exactly what I am on about.  You are severely restricted in what you can change and you are always having to look for unforeseen consequences.<br /><br />That is why it is like a game of Jenga, you remove one piece or replace it but you run the risk of it all toppling down.  I guess that is why clean slates are probably so appealing to programmers, as you reach a state of coding entropy where it is collapsing under its own weight.<br /><br />How many times have you tried to rewrite and replace something that was badly engineered and found that there were numerous side-effects.  Regression and unit testing are great things, but marketing and sales don't care about that, and it all costs money after all.<br /><br />So next time you are banging your head up against a brick wall with what you are working on, it is just Code Jenga.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/1600/jenga.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/320/jenga.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
