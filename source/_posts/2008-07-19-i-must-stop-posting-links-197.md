Some more links&#8230; I didn&#8217;t mean to make it a regular thing, but I&#8217;ll only post a collection of links if I have written a proper post beforehand or it will just turn into a link farm.

[Firebuggin&#8217;][1]  
John Resig will be driving the new [Firebug][2] team at Mozilla so development of it should come along leaps and bounds.

[Dell&#8217;s Ubuntu love-in expands to new laptops][3]  
Dell have made Ubuntu available on even more laptops.

[OpenMoko Train Wreck][4]  
A video demonstrating the OpenMoko user interface. It didn&#8217;t get a very positive review.

[Google Integrates Services Into the New iGoogle][5]  
A look at the new iGoogle interface. Also, near the end is the magic incantation for enabling the beta. I&#8217;ve used it a little and it is really quite good.

[papercraft batmobile: the dark knight gets his car back][6]  
A batmobile made out of paper? It looks absolutely amazing. Full instructions are available.
