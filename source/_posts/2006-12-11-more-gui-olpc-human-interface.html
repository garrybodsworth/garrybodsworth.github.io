<a href="http://www.laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)</a> is an initiative to try and get information technology to those children in the world that do not have it.  Some people think it is a great idea, others don't but the merits of this project I don't think can be measured until it is in full swing.  Hopefully it will be of benefit, after all anything is better than nothing.<br /><br />The <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Human_Interface_Guidelines">Human Interface Guidelines</a> have been available for a couple of weeks.  This covers "Sugar" the laptop user interface and how to develop applications for it.  There is a <a href="http://www.wildgardenseed.com/mike/olpc.html">great blog post from Mike Hearn</a> that extracts the essence of the guidelines.  It looks like there could be some interesting UI features on the little laptop.</div>
