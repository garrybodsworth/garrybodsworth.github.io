[Esquire to geeks: hack our e-paper magazine cover][1]  
Two pages of e-ink paper in one magazine for the normal price. The sponsorship will help pay for it, and I suppose if it works it could set a precedent. Now Esquire are challenging people to hack it into something else.

I bet that these magazines prove hard to get hold of, but I&#8217;ll definitely be up for buying some and then doing some hacking (I&#8217;m sure [Hackaday][2] will have some interesting posts when the time rolls around). I wonder if it would be easy to [connect one to a network][3]&#8230;

[Feedburner Are Looking Into The Zero Subscriber Problem][4]  
I thought I was going mad looking at massive fluctuations on Feedburner (although most of the time it stayed at zero). Fingers crossed this gets solved soon.

[Massive blogging growth in UK][6]  
One in 84 website visits is to a blog, and blogging shall inherit the earth. It&#8217;s probably the frequently updated content that helps, but when does a magazine news site become a blog and vice-versa.

[Watchmen #29 In The US Top Selling Books][7]  
Not bad for a twenty-odd year old &#8220;comic&#8221;. It&#8217;s undeniably brilliant and the book deserves the exposure it is getting.

[TARDIS MAME cabinet makes even Daleks swoon][8]  
MAME + TARDIS = Double-Plus Good

[Delicious Rolls Out Version 2.0][9]  
Delicious rolls out its new URL and swish new look, and it does indeed look good.

[Microsoft FrameIt Turns Web Pages & Feeds into Framed Images][10]  
Delivering content to photo frames by Microsoft.
