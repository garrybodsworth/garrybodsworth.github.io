One of the things we pride ourself with at work is well written code.  In a previous post I have mentioned the code review (also known as peer review) process, but we also use <a href="http://www.gimpel.com/">Lint by Gimpel Software</a> for static C++ code analysis.<br /><br />There was a new article about <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/Test_64-bit_applications.asp">The Problems of Testing 64-bit Applications</a> which is interesting from the point of view that it approaches the problem from a code correctness viewpoint.<br /><br />At the end of the article there is a good selection of links to interesting software, papers and theories.</div>
