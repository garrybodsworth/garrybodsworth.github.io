Microsoft have just released the beta of the Visual Studio 2008 "Feature Pack" which is an update for the C++ portion of the environment.  The main features are substantial updates to MFC and TR1 library support.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">The VC++ 2008 MFC libraries have been extended to support creation of applications that have:<br />    * Office Ribbon style interface<br />    * Office 2007, Office 2003 and Office XP look and feel<br />    * Modern Visual Studio-style docking toolbars and panes<br />    * Fully customizable toolbars and menus<br />    * A rich set of advanced GUI controls<br />    * Advanced MDI tabs and groups<br />    * And much more!<br /><br />This feature pack also includes an implementation of TR1. Portions of TR1 are scheduled for adoption in the upcoming C++0x standard as the first major addition to the ISO 2003 standard C++ library. Our implementation includes a number of important features such as:<br />    * Smart pointers<br />    * Regular expression parsing<br />    * New containers (tuple, array, unordered set, etc)<br />    * Sophisticated random number generators<br />    * Polymorphic function wrappers<br />    * Type traits<br />    * And more!<br /><br />Note: This feature pack does not include C99 compatibility or support for special math functions.</span><br /><br />Certainly for anyone maintaining MFC based products it is a free upgrade tot he look and feel of the program with tons of advantages.<br /><br />You can <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=D466226B-8DAB-445F-A7B4-448B326C48E7&displaylang=en">download it here</a>.  Unfortunately it tries to force you to download Silverlight which I have been avoiding like the plague but the attempts to get you to install it from Microsoft are getting more aggressive.</div>
