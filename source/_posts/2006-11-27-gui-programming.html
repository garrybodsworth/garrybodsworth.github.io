<div class='post'>
It's not often a thread on GUI programming comes up on <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> but there is one <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/11/25/205243">here</a>.  There are probably some useful links in the comments if you dig enough.<br /><br />I dunno, it strikes me there is a lack of discussion about GUIs in general compared to other programming subjects, possibly due to entrenched positions about what everyone personally sees as "best".</div>
