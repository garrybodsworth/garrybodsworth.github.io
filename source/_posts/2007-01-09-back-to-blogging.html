<div class='post'>
After a nice vacation I think it is time to get back to blogging.  I managed to completely miss I posted my 100th entry last year as well.<br /><br />For this year though, looking ahead...<br /><br />More on my journey through the land on Windows Vista.  Much more on GUI toolkits.  An updated Subversion toolbar for Visual Studio 2005.  More open-source software that catches my fancy.  One of the things I'd like to look at more closely is KDE4 because there has been a flurry of recent information.  Hopefully, providing my wife will let me, I'll be getting a new Mac, so hopefully I can wax lyrical about some splendid Apple products.<br /><br />There is probably loads more I can't think of thanks to having a break from computers, but I will be aiming to keep up the post a day average.</div>
