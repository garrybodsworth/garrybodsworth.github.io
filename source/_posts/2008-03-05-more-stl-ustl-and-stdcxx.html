Thanks to a commenter on the <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2008/03/stl-related-rdestl.html">RDESTL post</a> I made yesterday, they pointed me at the <a href="http://ustl.sourceforge.net/">uSTL</a> (I assume pronounced micro-STL).<br /><br />It is a partial implementation of the STL specification.  It reduces code size by making memory allocation a non-templated base class.  As far as I can tell this reduces executable size because of less template bloat.  Whether it is faster or smaller in memory for the containers is another matter.  I suppose by reducing the executable size  cache coherency could be improved leading to some interesting speed-ups.<br /><br />It is for POSIX-based systems, and there is no maintained Windows port (a choice of the developer) although some peole have got it to work on Windows with differing levels of success.<br /><br />And another STL implementation I stumbled across is the <a href="http://stdcxx.apache.org/">Apache stdcxx</a>.  The project was started from a code donation by Rogue Wave who decided to open-source their commercial offering.<br /><br />At the end of 2007 stdcxx made it to an Apache Top-Level Project which means it should be well supported.  And apparently performance s quite good as well.</div>

It's always interesting to have a STL implementation that everybody can understand. If you have already had a look at STL implementation and you haven't a headache you are very talented.<BR/><BR/>Anyway I have ported ustl for windows platforms and windows CE is in progress.<BR/>You can find it here : http://www.smartmobili.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=41&lang=english</div>

The Visual C++ compiler is actually very good at eliminating code bloat from templates (The COMDAT folding compiler option)<BR/>Often, most instantiations of a template end up identical anyway, so merging them into a single object is a fairly obvious optimization.<BR/><BR/>In my experience, that pretty much eliminates the problem entirely on Windows, so the lack of a Windows port of uSTL doesn't seem to be a big deal.<BR/><BR/>By contrast, GCC doesn't (or didn't) perform similar tricks. They had a fairly long discussion about implementing such an optimization on their dev mailing list a while back, and back then, the consensus was that it would compromise standards compliance (because it could mean multiple functions could end up with the same addresses)<BR/><BR/>I don't know if GCC has added this optimization since then, but I doubt it.<BR/><BR/>Which makes uSTL relevant on GCC platforms, but essentially pointless on Windows.</div>
