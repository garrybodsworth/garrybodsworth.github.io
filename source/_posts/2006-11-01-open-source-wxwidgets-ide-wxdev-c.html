In a previous post I have mentioned the splendid free IDE <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">Code::Blocks</a>, but in the dark old days of a few years ago, before Microsoft gave stuff away for free and development was quite an expensive endevour, there existed <a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html">DevC++</a>.  It was a free IDE written in Delphi that provided good library management and also was an IDE for GCC in Windows.<br /><br />Over the years other IDEs have sprung up and essentially overtaken Dev-C++ in terms of features and quality.  Then someone decided to make a branch, one that was going to have integrated GUI editing.  This project eventually became <a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/">wxDevC++</a>.<br /><br />A new version has just been released with even more features from wxWidgets integrated into the GUI editor.  Most importantly it now has support for Visual C++ compilers (v6, 2003, and 2005) which is interesting.  I need to go and check out this IDE in more detail, but it is good to see it is more than alive and kicking.  If you are a wxWidgets developer it is one of the most comprehensive integrated IDEs for developing and looks like it will be going from strength to strength judging from the <a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/changelog.php#610">changelog</a> for this version.<br /><br />And here is a little screenshot with the GUI editor up from their <a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/">website</a>:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/1600/thumbnail.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/320/thumbnail.png" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>

Not to be overly winded, but I think I should recognize your review as being professional quality gary. Excellent work.<BR/><BR/> You have obviously taken some writing courses or have a natural affinity for the art.<BR/><BR/> CAD, RPC, CNC stuff hunh?<BR/> Neat stuff!</div>

On the topic of: visually oriented programming IDEs with GUI designer matrices, U++ another C++ development tool is up and coming rapidly.<BR/><BR/> It is powerful with stramlined template handling for C++ and the code files look like C#'s in size.<BR/><BR/> The com for the control components never seems to go past a sentence's worth of statement.<BR/><BR/> Succint coding is U++ tagline.<BR/><BR/> The only noticable problems with U++ are: the actual coding comes off as a branching of standard C++ bringing with it a culture shock for C++ programmers, the bug report output is a bit on the vague side, the IDE is a bit too strict with the setup of a project, and there are far too few reference resources.<BR/><BR/> Do not be fooled by the short-comings as the resources that do exist are excellent. With the coding you can be comfortable in about thirty days I would say and your off to the races.<BR/><BR/> The U++ IDE is definitely about brevity, precision, speed, more speed, and cross-platform development with mobile computational devices coming up in the near future.<BR/><BR/> Check into U++; you will not be disappointed.</div>

DevC++ was definitely a hallmark in the history of open source IDE technology. Ansi and ISO C/C++ handling as-well-as the Package Manager(PackMan) threw DevC++ to the forefront.<BR/><BR/> wxDevC++ has and will continue to leverage these same powerful frameworks. The look and feel of wxDevC++ is quite similar to Visual Studio products bringing with it a familiarity. Unfortunately the controls are a bit unmanaged and thrown together at the moment.<BR/><BR/> The newer wxWidgets v2.8 recommendations for wxWidget's namespace change is incorporated. Sizer components are however buggy and are of a serious issue within the wxWidget community. Proportions are not handled correctly at all and are paramount within the sizer struct.<BR/><BR/> In conclusion: it would appear that the product is operation with a seriously limited capacity at this point. wxDevC++ does handle generic C++, virtual classes, and references very nicely. This alone says that the product is capable.<BR/><BR/> The development stage of wxDevC++ would realistically put one in the frame of mind that: the IDE is a no holds barred peddle to the metal dev endev. Something this young with this broad a scope would have more serious issues to contend with.<BR/><BR/> the developers of wxDevC++ have been hard at work and have just started on the path. I suspect that the product with such a young and talented staff of developers is going to provide an excellent platform for cross development systems.</div>
