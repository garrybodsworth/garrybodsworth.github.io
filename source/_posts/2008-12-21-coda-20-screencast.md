The main reason I have had my head down of late is that I have been beavering away at work on the next version of our [CODA system][1]. What is CODA? It is a digital signage system from [Camvine][2], where you configure it all through the web and it&#8217;s ease of use.

We are gearing up to release the new web interface in the new year. This will be v2.0 where we leave behind the remnants of the engineering interface and have a full drag&#8217;n'drop experience all with a professional spit and polish. Also we will be rolling out the new client software which will add lots of new functionality.

Now we have released a new [screencast of the new website][3] running with the new client software. You can see how to get a system up and running in three minutes, with things like monitor autodiscovery. The soothing tones of [Michael Dales][4] provide the voice-over.

The first video on the page shows you the general interface, the second video is the set-up in three minutes.

These are very exciting times at [Camvine][5] as this platform is an excellent base to build off as well.
