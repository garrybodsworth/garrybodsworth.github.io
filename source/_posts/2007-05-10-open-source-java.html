<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2127458,00.asp">Sun announced the open-source Java Development Kit</a> recently.  It's under the GPLv2 license and it looks like they want to capture the open-source community.<br /><br />This could be a really interesting period since Java may start to gain even more traction as more people become involved in its development.  Hopefully meaning slicker VMs being released.<br /><br />OpenBSD are currently merging this <a href="http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20070508192340">release into their codebase</a>.  I imagine others will not be far behind.  I hope it means that it becomes well supported on many platforms.<br /><br />You can see the OpenJDK website <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">here</a>.</div>
