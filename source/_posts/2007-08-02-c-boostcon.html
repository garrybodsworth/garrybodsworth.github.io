Back in May <a href="http://www.boostcon.com/home">Boostcon</a> took placein May this year.  I have posted previously about some of the already available talk slides (see the <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Papers_and_Presentations">Adobe ones here</a>).  See my previous post <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/05/boostcon-2007-presentations.html">here</a>.<br /><br />There are a couple of new articles <a href="http://www.artima.com/cppsource/boost_con_07.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.artima.com/cppsource/boost_con_07_up_close.html">here</a> that make interesting reading.  Also an attendee has some write ups <a href="http://blog.emptycrate.com/">here</a>.  Some more slides <a href="http://www.nabble.com/BoostCon-2007-Slides-t3849974.html">are also available</a>.  More write-ups <a href="http://jeffandhoa.com/blog/">here</a>.<br /><br />Fingers crossed one day I'll be able to attend something as interesting as this.</div>
