An interesting new blog is out there about physics-based animation.  You can go and read it <a href="http://animationphysics.wordpress.com/">here</a>.<br /><br />It is mainly from a gaming perspective but I think that most of the theory can be applied to engineering as well.  A lot of great theory comes out of the gaming arena and they certainly share ideas a lot more than the engineering arena.</div>

I think that part of the theory coming from this is that it is thought about from a practical real-world use standpoint.  It is always possible to come up with the ideal solution but I would say it very rarely works in the real world without an extremely small problem domain.</div>

Well, to be fair it's really coming more from an academic computer graphics and film/visual effects standpoint, since a lot of the stuff there isn't really fast enough to be incorporated into real-time games (though might be soon, with GPU's going the way they are). But I definitely agree with your point about theory coming out of the graphics world; there's a lot of smart people in graphics these days, and I think it's more and more plausible that some of what gets developed will feed back into the computational mechanics and fluid dynamics communities.</div>
