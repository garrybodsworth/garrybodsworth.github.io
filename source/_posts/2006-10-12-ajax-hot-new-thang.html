I can't be the only one.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a> has taken off, so I took a closer look at it and realised I have essentially been doing AJAX for years.  I referred to it as XML and Javascript to render a web page (not using XSLT).<br /><br />Maybe I've completely missed the point, but the only difference between what AJAX is now (in simplistic terms) and what I did a while back was the way the XML was being retrieved.  Admittedly my Javascript was way simpler than these new flashy whizz-bang sites, but the same data/view separation was there.  I am pretty sure it was referred to as DHTML (although I think that also encompassed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript">VBScript</a>).<br /><br />I must admit these Javascript platforms are really impressive, especially as the browser support gets better, like with WYSIWYG editors embedded in webpages which is what I am typing this with.  I just realised this post seemed a bit negative, but I think it's all FANTASTIC! (Fast Show fans will know what I am on about)</div>
