It's aliiiiiive!<br /><br />After a few years of hosting my own blog on http://programmerslog.com I have come back to Blogger.&nbsp; This unfortunately was caused by losing the domain which is pretty sad....&nbsp; I have a back up of the few hundred blog posts in a SQL dump but I doubt I will find the energy to extract them(!)<br /><br />What will be on this blog now?&nbsp; Any projects I publish on Github, lots of Python, Linux, coding, and probably my random artistic scribblings.<br /><br />I must say Blogger is looking rather swish nowadays, part of the reason to use Wordpress was for the features, but now I can do pretty much what I want here.&nbsp; Also I don't have to worry about renewing my domain subscriptions or doing software updates...<br /><br />I've reconfigured all my feeds to point to this blog since it is the only active one.<br /> <br />Now I just have to actually write some content...</div>
