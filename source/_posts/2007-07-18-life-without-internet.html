Argh!  The web has been down at work for over 24 hours.  I now realise it is 100% essential for my job.  Google has replaced a certain portion of my brain....  I can't answer any questions without it (okay, a slight exaggeration).<br /><br />One tool I have now found indispensable now is <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>.  Up until recently I have used the Google Browser Sync for using my bookmarks at multiple locations.  The problem I found is I am very selective about what I bookmark as current bookmarking UIs available in IE and FireFox do not scale very well.  Then I get in the situation I haven' bookmarked something and I spend ages on Google tryin to find it again.<br /><br />I decided to move to del.ico.us as there was a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615">new tool for Firefox</a> which replaces the bookmarking system in Firefox, so now I use it exclusively tagging webpages at will.  Obviously the number of bookmarks I have is increasing rapidly especially since I can even tag individual articles.<br /><br />As you can see on the sidebar you can see what I am currently bookmarking and what I have bookmarked.  I have also added the ability to bookmark individual articles quickly if you want.  I tend to find most web technologies a bit hollow (MySpace Facebook and the suchlike) but this is a tool that reallyhelps make the web a better place, and all users of the system are sharing what they know with their bookmarks.</div>
