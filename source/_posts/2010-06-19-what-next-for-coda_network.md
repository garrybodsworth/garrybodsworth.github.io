You can get [coda_network here][1] and read about it in my previous post.

So what am I planning to do next for coda_network? To be honest it is functionally complete from my requirements but there are some less glamorous things that need doing.

*   Finish writing up the unit test suite for proxies, downloads and requests.
*   Add some more example scripts for downloading and the suchlike.
*   Add an example mini_proxy that is half written right now that provides a Python based local proxy that can connect to any of the supported parent proxies.
*   Fix any bugs I find and from any feedback.
*   Try to egage the Python community to get these fixes or something similar pushed upstream.
*   And when I feel really brave &#8211; go have a look at Python 3.
