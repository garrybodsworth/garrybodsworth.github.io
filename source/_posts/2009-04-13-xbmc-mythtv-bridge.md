It seems I spoke to soon, I stumbled across [MythBox][1] just after posting about MythTV. It seems it will let me schedule through XBMC my MythTV recordings and let me watch live TV.

The [screenshots here][2] look really good. And it seems then I will be able to leave behind MythFrontend. I&#8217;m not too sure where the Subversion repository lives, but you get all the python files in the tar.gz, which makes it look pretty hackable.
