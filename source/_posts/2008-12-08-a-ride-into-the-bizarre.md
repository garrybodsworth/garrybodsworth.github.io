When I was at the University of Essex I won the Bowden Memorial Prize in my first year. Nothing too odd about that, but then in a magazine whilst I was at Uni I read an article that mentioned Dr Keith Bowden of the Computer Science Department dying in mysterious circumstances in 1982. My interest was piqued but details were hard to come by.

Even in the whizzy days of the Internet and more public access to archives I seem to only be able to find one article that mentions him. All other links all lead back to either the article or reproductions thereof.

It all relates to the [Strategic Defense Initiative][1] (or Star Wars as it is better known). Apparently the scientists working on it started dying with alarming frequency of dubious circumstances. I don&#8217;t know if it is any more statistically interesting than any other sampling of people over the same period (so I am not peddling some conspiracy theory).

One of the articles can be found here &#8211; [Did 22 SDI Researchers really ALL Commit Suicide?][2] From what I can tell noone ever bothered to actually try and research it and everything just reprints the same thing. It is pretty intere4sting though from the point of view Essex University had someone working on the SDI&#8230;
