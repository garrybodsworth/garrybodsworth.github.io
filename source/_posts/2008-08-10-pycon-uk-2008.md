PyCon UK is a convention for the Python programming language in sunny old Birmingham. This year it is from the 12th to 14th of September and it only costs Â£75 for all three days.

Now I am using Python every day I think maybe I should attend this year. Looking at the talks that are going on it should be an extremely interesting conference. For a start they have [Mark Shuttleworth][1] (of Canonical/Ubuntu fame) and [Ted Leung][2] to deliver the keynotes.

So far the talks scheduled are the tutorials one Friday which include PyQt4, Django, and Google App Engine. The Django talk will be hosted by [Jacob Kaplan-Moss][3] who is one of the benevolent dictators of the project (and creator) and he will be outlining version 1.0 (due in September).

The accepted talks can all be viewed [here][4]. It certainly looks like there is a lot of variety.

Last year [Julian Todd][5] did a talk on [Public Whip][6] and I believe an impromptu one on CAM development. It was a shame to miss those.
