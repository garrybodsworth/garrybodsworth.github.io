Whilst scouring the <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/">Adobe ASL</a> website (which contains an open-source GUI toolkit) I encountered a few interesting links and tidbits of information.  The ASL is written in C++ utilising sections of Boost (part of which now includes Adobe's on GIL library) and the most hardcore of generic programming techniques.<br /><br />The most interesting thing I came across was from Alexander Stepanov, the father of the STL, and writer of books about advanced template programming.  <a href="http://www.stepanovpapers.com/notes.pdf">Alexander Stepanov's Notes</a> is a substantial PDF file (more of a book really) that collates and updates his notes from various lectures including those at Adobe and SGI.  It is not entirely about C++ as such, it is just the example language used is C++.<br /><br />This also lead me to find the <a href="http://www.stepanovpapers.com/">Stepanov Papers website</a> which provides a resource for reading his wide selection of papers.<br /><br />And for a bit more background on Generic programming check out these overviews <a href="http://www.boost.org/more/generic_programming.html">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming">here</a>.</div>
