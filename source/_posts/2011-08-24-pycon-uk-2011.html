Unfortunately I was unable to make it to EuroPython 2011 due to its location (no longer being in Birmingham).&nbsp; The good news is that the same guys who ran Europython in Birmingham have announced <a href="http://pyconuk.org/">Pycon UK</a> in Coventry.<br /><br />For the reasonable price of Â£95 you get two days of Python goodness.&nbsp; As their website says:<br /><blockquote>                     <br />Sessions will include testing, a code clinic,  Django, PyPy, XML, Design and Graphical Programming. There will be an  unscheduled room for dynamic talks and time allocated for sprints. The  weekend will also feature the return of our ever boisterous conference  dinner!</blockquote>I've paid for my ticket already and Python events are always educational and entertaining.</div>
