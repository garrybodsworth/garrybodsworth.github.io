Some good articles about Bazaar can be read here:<br />* Part 1 - <a href="http://ianclatworthy.wordpress.com/2007/06/21/version-control-the-future-is-adaptive/">Version Control : The Future Is Adaptive</a><br />* Part 2 - <a href="http://ianclatworthy.wordpress.com/2007/07/02/it-takes-a-community-to-raise-great-software/">It Takes A Community To Raise Great Software</a><br />* Part 3 - <a href="http://ianclatworthy.wordpress.com/2007/07/11/wanted-rock-solid-version-control/">Wanted : Rock Solid Version Control</a><br />* Part 4 - <a href="http://ianclatworthy.wordpress.com/2007/07/18/version-control-plug-ins-vs-toolkits/">Version Control: Plug-ins Versus Toolkits</a><br /><br />The blogger Ian Clatworthy does work on Bazaar so it obviously has a slant that way, but he makes good points and knows what he is on about.  Or maybe I am biased now after being pleasantly surprised by Bazaar...</div>
