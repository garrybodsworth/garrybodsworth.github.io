On my home Mac I have been using [Porticus][1] to manage packages from [MacPorts][2]. What I discovered today installing packages for work (a fair few) was that about halfway through the day I had reverted entirely to the commandline and I don&#8217;t particularly know how or why but I was a hell of a lot faster at it.

After working in Windows which I have found commandline avoidable. It doesn&#8217;t really work when you are installing lots of programs (each one installs differently, MSIs, copying, and who knows what) and trying to script a system (without reverting to something like cygwin).

As I head down the road of the commandline I realised that I don&#8217;t know enough shortcuts so I&#8217;m going to have to learn more of them to accomplish tasks faster. I think soon I&#8217;ll be using emacs full time&#8230;
