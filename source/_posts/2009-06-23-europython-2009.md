The [EuroPython 2009][1] conference is less than a week away, I have no idea where June went. It should be a great time in sunny Birmingham. I am going to the conference days Tuesday through Thursday.

There are [loads of talks][2] so my brain should be crammed after three days of that. I might also try out doing a lightning talk whilst I am there. although I would have to put some thought into what I&#8217;d talk about.

You can register [here][3] with the three conference days costing Â£190.
