One of the things I really want to check out over the next few weeks are open-source GUI toolkits.  There are quite a few to choose from and I tend to jump from camp-to-camp on a weekly basis as to which one I find the most interesting.<br /><br />Since I am using Visual C++ 2005 Express, the ones I try out fully will be tested and compiled (if indeed a successful compilation is possible) on that platform.<br /><br />The initial ones I have already had a good go at over the past few weeks are <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a>, <a href="http://www.vcf-online.org">Visual Component Framework (VCF)</a>, and <a href="http://www.torjo.com/win32gui/index.html">Win32GUI Generics</a>.  Some others I have been reading about are <a href="http://smartwin.sourceforge.net/">Smartwin++</a>, <a href="http://upp.sourceforge.net/">Ultimate++</a>, <a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a>, and <a href="http://www.fox-toolkit.org/">FOX</a>.<br /><br />Also I want to write up a bit more of a comprehensive howto on Boost Python, as I quite enjoyed playing around with that.</div>

Oh yeah, I remember looking at that and having a big problem wrapping my brain around it because of how big it was.  Certainly if it becomes the basis for their products it is one to watch.</div>

One more toolkit to check out in your GUI series. The Adobe Open Source libraries <br /><br />http://opensource.adobe.com/<br />http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=132417&ssid=10238<br /><br />They certainly use an overall approach that is different from what I am used to seeing.</div>
