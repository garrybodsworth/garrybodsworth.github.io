One of my guilty pleasures is <a href="http://www.sigames.com">Football Manager (and previously Championship Manager)</a>, it is definitely my favourite type of game - open-ended, considered, and graphics are not the most important part - it is gameplay.<br /><br />On the <a href="http://www.sigames.com">SI Games website</a> there is a forum with a programmers corner.  There is a great little post on the forum by Marc Vaughan (lead developer type guy) about designing a management game.  It covers in quite a lot of depth, although it is not completely finished.</div>
