<a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/feature/?id=14952">This article</a> describes the problems ahead for indie developers on the Vista platform.<br /><br />The new Game Explorer feature seems to be the new point of call for games on the system.  Unfortunately the price to get certificated for it can be substantial when someone is coding in their spare time.  Obviously they can still install them as normal applications but it limits whatever people they are trying to sell to.  Unfortunately, intentionally or not the new way of doing things tilts Windows further away from allowing access to the platform.</div>
