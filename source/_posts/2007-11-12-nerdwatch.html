The article du jour on the Internet for any self-respecting nerd is <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/11/11/the_nerd_handbook.html">this one</a>.  It details the characteristics of computer nerds in a lighthearted and serious way.  I guarantee you will see some of yourself in it as you are reading this blog and it is about development and programming (well, it tries to be).<br /><br />I have a "Cave" but I rarely use it now after getting a Macbook Pro so I can be in the same room as my wife whilst using the computer.  The article gets too many things right, although I hope I am more socially adjusted than the article suggests I should be ;)<br /><br />The website <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com">Rands In Repose</a> has plenty of good quality articles from management to interview techniques, so it is also worth going through his archive if that interests you.</div>
