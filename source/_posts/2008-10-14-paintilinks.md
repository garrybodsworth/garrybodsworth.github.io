[Browser Paint Events][1]  
Work out what is being painted and when in your browser.

[PyPy &#8211; Sprint Discussions: C++ Library Bindings][2]  
An interesting thought process on hooking C++ libraries into Python. What I had never heard of was the Reflex package which provides introspection and sounds very interesting.

[Ubuntu Dust Theme][3]  
Make your Ubuntu look extremely cool. This theme is fantastic and clear, and I particularly like the fact that there are no window borders! How this isn&#8217;t the default theme for some distribution I have no idea. Oh yeah, make sure you have the Firefox theme as well to make it look more integrated.

[Vinyl Wall Design][4]  
They have some very cool Space Invaders and Pacman wall decorations.

[iPhone Doodles][5]  
An artist using &#8220;Brushes&#8221; on the iPhone with some really good results.

[The Painted Covers of Norman Saunders][6]  
Beautiful classic painted covers.
