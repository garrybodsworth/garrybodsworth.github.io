I must admit, although I am not very interested in running Microsoft Windows Vista as my own operating system at home, I am interested in understanding the UI technologies that are going to be available in it.  It's certainly necessary to understand it for work.<br /><br />A more interesting application of these new UI features are how the cross-platform toolkits going to incorporate them (and indeed whether some of it is so useless that it shouldn't be incorporated).  I don't think that the toolkits will struggle to keep up since each time operating system UIs try to diverge they always end up converging.  I do think that the way these toolkits expand will show which ones are the best designed (you know, the extra functionalty being less kludgey).<br /><br />There is nother decent blog article about DWM <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/greg_schechter/archive/2006/09/14/753605.aspx">here</a>.</div>
