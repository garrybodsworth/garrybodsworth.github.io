Joel On Software has an interesting little post <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/29.html">about source control</a> and how Microsoft does it (specifically with the Vista codebase).<br /><br />You can see how it can all get out of control, and how it is easy to find yourself stuck as part of a process that doesn't scale, and how this can adversely effect an entire project.  It also shows a lack of modularity since other projects of a large size do not necessarily have similar problems.</div>
