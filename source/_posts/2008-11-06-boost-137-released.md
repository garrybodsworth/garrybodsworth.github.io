This month [Boost 1.37 has been released][1]. It&#8217;s the latest version of the extremely useful peer reviewed C++ libraries that a large portion of has fed into the latest C++ standards.

There is only one new library this time out which is Boost.Proto:

> Proto is a framework for building Domain Specific Embedded Languages in C++. It provides tools for constructing, type-checking, transforming and executing expression templates. More specifically, Proto provides:
> 
> *   An expression tree data structure.
> *   A mechanism for giving expressions additional behaviors and members.
> *   Operator overloads for building the tree from an expression.
> *   Utilities for defining the grammar to which an expression must conform.
> *   An extensible mechanism for immediately executing an expression template.
> *   An extensible set of tree transformations to apply to expression trees.

There are the usual myriad of bug fixes with the other libraries. They are still following their regular release cycles which is a good thing.
