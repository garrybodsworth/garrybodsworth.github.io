Even though Windows Vista has been out a few months the myth that OpenGL is being degraded is still being perpetuated.  Even though it was debunked what seems like at least a year ago the story just seems to have legs.<br /><br />Anyway to re-emphasise that all is well in the land of OpenGL they have promoted the article about <a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/article/vol003_9/">OpenGL on Vista to their frontpage</a>.  Obviously support is still not as robust as the XP implementation, but then again most drivers are lacking at the moment (due to the recency of the release).</div>
