I've mentioned before about the usefulness of <a href="http://www.gimpel.com/">PC-Lint</a> when doing C++ development on Windows.  It closes off a whole class of bugs that can live in a codebase and raises teh minimum standard of development.<br /><br />I came across a really decent article you can read <a href="http://powerof2games.com/node/27">here</a>.  They integrated it into their automated build process and bootstrapped Msbuild to use it.<br /><br />Also, you can't forget that there are some good tools that can make it easier to use.  There is <a href="http://www.riverblade.co.uk/products/lintproject/">LintProject</a> to run Lint across an entire project, and also there is the <a href="http://www.riverblade.co.uk/products/visual_lint/index.html">Visual Lint</a> which is a nice integration into Visual Studio.<br /><br />It would be nice however if somehow it was possible to integrate it completely with the cl.exe commandline.</div>

Hi,<BR/><BR/>It would be nice to have more options on the compiler to help with things like const-correctness, uninitialised data and the suchlike.<BR/><BR/>Admittedly Lint is on version 8.0 but it is on something like revision "v" and there is one for each letter of the alphabet ;)<BR/><BR/>I think that the tool is so simple to use that it kind of transcends the new version needed philosophy.  I imagine if they supplied the integration with lots of products there would be even less versions of Lint out...<BR/><BR/>PVCS 5.3?  Will any of the conversion scripts out there work for that to get to a new revision control system?  The one I have seen works on version 6.8 upwards...<BR/><BR/>Thanks,<BR/>Garry</div>

What I would like is an opensource version of it. Something that has been around so long, you would of thought that the large OS developers would be in need of such a tool and thus a project be born.<BR/><BR/>When I saw the powerof2 article, I had a look at our software cupboard and there was a copy of PCLint7.5 dated 1998. So in 10 years it has advanced less than a single version:-)<BR/><BR/>Then again we are using PVCS5.3 - a horribly broken Windows 3.1 program botched to Win95 while Team Foundation Server sits in the aforementioned cupboard. But that is an article in itself.</div>
