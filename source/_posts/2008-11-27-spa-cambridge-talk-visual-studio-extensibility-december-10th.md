### VSX: Extend Your Development Experience

**Jean-Marc Prieur (Microsoft)**  
**December 10th 2008, 7:00pm (light buffet) 7:30pm (talk)**  
**Venue: [MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge][3]**  
*Event sponsored by Red Gate Software.*

** Synopsis: **  
Microsoft Visual Studio provides a great set of development tools out of the box, but you may be surprised at how much more you can do with its rich extensibility platform. In this introductory session, we will give you a whirlwind tour of what the Visual Studio Extensibility (VSX) platform has to offer and how you can take advantage of it. Whether you are looking to increase you development team&#8217;s productivity, or you are looking for new business opportunities on the Visual Studio platform, this technical session will help you get started.
