[Black Dynamite][1]  
This film looks funk-tastic. Check out the trailer.

[Are we the last of the geeks?][2]  
Obviously it is up to geeks to train the next generation of geeks.

[Linux gains FPS][3]  
Prey gets a native Linux client. It&#8217;s actually a fairly recent game in the grand scheme of things. I think also X3 Reunion for Linux is coming out this month.

[Big Screen Virus Alert Is Worse Than a Big Screen BSoD][4]  
Impressive use of virus checking. At least there is no chance of that in [Coda][5].

[Eclipse Plugin For Mercurial &#8211; Version 1.2 Released][6]  
Decent IDE integration for Mercurial distributed source control.

[ A new concept of wireless handheld device ‘Mintpad’][7]  
A wireless gadgety post-it note. It also plays MP3s&#8230;.

[OpenOffice&#8217;s UI will be getting a refurb][8]  
These types of things promise so much but tend to offer incremental moves forward when they realise the leap is too great.

[First look: can Songbird 1.0 replace iTunes, WMP?][9]  
The Songbird v1.0 release has been covered everywhere, but is it any good?

[Getting OpenID Into the Browser][10]  
The social oriented browser Flock has a new extension for managing OpenID from within the browser.

[Mobieus &#8211; Jodorowsky’s Dune (1)][11]  
Jodorowsky is a demented writing genius bringing us The Incal and Metabarons. Moebius is on a similar level for artwork. Shame they never got to make this film although it would probably have scared the general public to death.

[Philippe Druillet&#8217;s and Moebius&#8217; Approche Sur Centauri][12]  
More stunning Moebius artwork.
