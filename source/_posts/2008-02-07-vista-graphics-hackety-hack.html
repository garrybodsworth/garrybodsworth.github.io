There is nothing more depressing than knowing you have to use a computer loaded up with Vista, especially when developing, because it is a constant battle.<br /><br />But deep in the bowels of the OS there are some interesting things, but they tend to be undocumented.  I'm not a fan of the layering of the GUI, and I always wondered if it was possible to use the base parts of the GUI DLLs which things like WP use as teir basis.<br /><br />Some exceedingly talented and clever developers have spent their brain cycles reverse engineering the completely undocumented dwm and milcore.dll (apart from the thumbnail API).  I'm not a fan of all the managed stuff especially since it mainly resoves down to the unmanaged core DLLs anyway.  Go <a href="http://siwu.info/">check out the blog here</a> with lots of videos of some exceedingly clever things.<br /><br />What is even better is that the developer has released it as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dwmaxx/">open-source</a>.  Hopefully this will provide a basis for more adventurous and useful developments.  With this amount of flexibility available then it should be possible to create something where Vista gets some good productivity gains.</div>
