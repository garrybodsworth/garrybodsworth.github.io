My day job is spent writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing">CAM software</a>.  There is a great little hacking site called <a href="http://www.hackaday.com">Hackaday</a>.  Those two sentences may look completely unrelated but it has some great articles about making your own tools (CNC machines) to do machining.<br /><br />Here is a list of CAM related articles:<br /><a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2006/07/12/how-to-build-your-own-cnc-mill/">How to build your own CNC mill</a><br /><a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2006/11/12/make-a-badass-cnc-mill/">Make a badass CNC mill</a><br /><a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2006/12/08/fab-home/">Fab@Home</a><br /><a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2007/01/01/snowboard-cnc-machine/">Snowboard CNC machine</a><br /><br />Fab@home looks really interesting as it is open-source and it is planned to manufacture itself.</div>

If you find fab@home impressive you might also want to take at look at the RepRap project out of the University of Bath in the UK...<br /><br />http://reprap.org<br /><br />Their soon-to-be released machine is also open source, has a proper plastics extruder presently qualified for polycapralactone which can make usuable, hard objects.  Whereas the fab@home machine costs $2,400 for parts, the RepRap Darwin is on track to cost no more than $400. <br /><br />A spinoff of the RepRap project, Tommelise, is focussed on the American parts environment and uses somewhat different technology and a different control strategy.  It's also an open source specification will let anybody with a few hand tools and primitive woodworking skills bootstrap themselves into 3D fabrication for about $150. Tommelise's extruder is qualified for polycapralactone and is presently being qualified as well for both high density polypropylene (HDPE, the stuff your plastic cutting board is made of) and polypropylene (HPP, the stuff your coffee maker and plastic electric kettle is made of).  You can keep an eye on the Tommelise project at...<br /><br />http://3dReplicators.com<br /><br />Have fun!</div>
