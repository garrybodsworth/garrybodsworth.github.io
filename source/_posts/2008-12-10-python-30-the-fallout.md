Last week Python 3.0 (nee 3000) was released with a big tidy up of the language. Â Reading through the new features [here][1] you can see plenty of shifting stuff around. It&#8217;s an interesting endeavor because you rarely get an opportunity to go back and correct the decay that inevitably happens. Since I am a newbie in the grand scheme of things to Python none of it looks particularly difficult to grasp or even change your code to do. I suppose if you have a large and crufty code base doing scary things it might be an issue.

A lot of bytes have been flying around the Internet either in support or more commonly against the Python 3.0 work. So for the prosecution you have posts like [this][2], posts in the middle like [this][3], or the defence like [this][4]. You do get [tools to help][5] and the [start of some docs][6]&#8230;.

The best thing to come out of the Python 3.0 release discussion is [this blog post][7]. I&#8217;m sure everyone who has had to work on legacy systems will know the monkeys, the cage, and the firehose. It&#8217;s always good to test that the firehose is actually on&#8230;.
