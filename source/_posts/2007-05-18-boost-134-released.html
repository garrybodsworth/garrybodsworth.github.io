The latest version of the <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> Library has been released.  This is version 1.34 and you can read the changes on the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost frontpage</a>.<br /><br />Boost is a fantastic peer reviewed library collection for C++.  It adds power and robustness for C++ programmers, after all we shouldn't need to reinvent the wheel all of the time.<br /><br />There are five new libraries:<br />     * Foreach Library:<br />         BOOST_FOREACH macro for easily iterating over the elements of a<br />         sequence, from Eric Niebler.<br />     * Statechart Library:<br />         Arbitrarily complex finite state machines can be implemented in<br />         easily readable and maintainable C++ code, from Andreas Huber.<br />     * TR1 Library:<br />         An implementation of the C++ Technical Report on Standard Library<br />         Extensions, from John Maddock.<br />         This library does not itself implement the TR1 components, rather<br />         it's a thin wrapper that will include your standard library's TR1<br />         implementation (if it has one), otherwise it will include the Boost<br />         Library equivalents, and import them into namespace std::tr1. Highlights<br />         include: Reference Wrappers, Smart Pointers, result_of,<br />         Function Object Binders, Polymorphic function wrappers, Type Traits,<br />         Random Number Generators and Distributions, Tuples, Fixed Size Array,<br />         Hash Function Objects, Regular Expressions and<br />         Complex Number Additional Algorithms.<br />     * Typeof Library:<br />         Typeof operator emulation, from Arkadiy Vertleyb and Peder Holt.<br />     * Xpressive Library:<br />         Regular expressions that can be written as strings or as expression<br />         templates, and that can refer to each other and themselves recursively<br />         with the power of context-free grammars, from Eric Niebler. <br /><br />Obviously lots of the other libraries have been updated like Boost::Python.</div>
