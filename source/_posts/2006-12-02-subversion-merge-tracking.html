One deficiency we encounter with Subversion is merge tracking.  This means when we merge branches or revisions we have to keep track in a manual or scripted process which has its own overhead.<br /><br />I am pleased to see that <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> now has its own <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/merge-tracking/">merge tracking project</a>, which is in its infancy but when it drops it will make it an even better and more powerful system.  The page has additional links for external merge tracking scripts like <a href="http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py">svnmerge</a>.</div>
