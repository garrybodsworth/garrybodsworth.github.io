I've mentioned this link previously, but there is a great resource for libraries that are freely available.<br /><br /><a href="http://abattoir.wolfpaw.net/personal/gamelibs.php">Free Game Development Libraries</a><br /><br />The list has had a recent update with even more libraries.  I just wish I had time to go through them all...</div>
