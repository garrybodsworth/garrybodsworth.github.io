The past week I have been compiling a list of free (open-source and closed-source) games available for Windows/Mac/Linux.  It is amazing how much there is out there, so I'll probably have to divide it up into multiple posts.<br /><br />There are lots of good quality open-source projects, which makes for lots of source code to eyeball which is really quite cool.<br /><br />But before I start down that road, there is a great blog called <a href="http://indygamer.blogspot.com/">Independent Gaming</a> which has great indy, freeware and open-source games.  The coverage is really comprehensive an has plenty of great reviews.</div>
