Yesterday I ran the Python Programming Dojo in Cambridge. It was my first time running such a public speaking event. We had four people in attendance which made it a bit easier on me after four or five last minute drop-outs.

Basically, it was to cover getting started in Python development from first concepts through to more advanced ones. I can hardly believe I talked more or less continually for six hours(!) I had prepared cue cards so I didn&#8217;t forget any subjects I wanted to cover and had smushed together a load of examples to go with each subject.

One of the most bizarre things was I didn&#8217;t get onto the fact Python had classes until lunchtime at 1pm&#8230;. It was hard to try and cover the basics because everything relied on something else, so I was dynamically juggling the order of the subjects.

The best bit was the interaction where people were coding whilst I was talking and the discussion points and questions came out of that.

I found it really hard to explain list comprehensions because I kind of instinctively knew them, but I had managed up until now to never need to explain them.

The benefits of doing this class were many for me. First, up I had programmed in Python for a while but I just did it and didn&#8217;t really think about why and how much I had used. Organising those thoughts was invaluable. Also, had to do speaking at the front of the room and I think I did okay apart from waving my hands too much and using the word &#8220;mad&#8221; too often in the description of Python features&#8230; The other benefit was I learnt some things as well.

The main Python feature I learnt was the [flyweight][1] pattern feature of Python classes. Basically if you define a variable as part of the class you maximise reuse of that object. If you defined a variable using self, it will be added to the class dictionary. We checked this by writing code which is the best way to learn.

I don&#8217;t know if I will end up running one again or if it is a one-off, but I will try to update my examples and subjects to reflect what I discovered throughout the day (if I actually transfer them to digital format rather than hand-written cards I&#8217;ll post it on here).

Finally, I&#8217;d like to thank [Red Gate Software][2] for supplying refreshments and somewhere to host it, [Mark Dalgarno][3] for organising it, and Clive Tong of Red Gate for making sure we could get in (and not forgetting the attendees).
