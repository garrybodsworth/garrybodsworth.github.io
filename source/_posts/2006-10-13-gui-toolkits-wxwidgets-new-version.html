<div class='post'>
A new development version of <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> has been released.  This is in a lead up to version 2.8, which will be the latest stable version.<br /><br />The new version of <a href="http://wxpack.sourceforge.net">wxPack</a> has not been released yet, but the new version will probably be out soon and no doubt feature <a href="http://www.wxformbuilder.org/">wxFormBuilder v3</a> (the new version of a GUI builder).<br /><br />If you like GUI building in wxWidgets then the 2.7 development codeline actually seems pretty stable from my tests.  If you are currently using 2.6 you are missing out on integrated <a href="http://www.kirix.com/community/wxaui.html">wxAUI</a> (advanced docking and UI kit) and quite a few other improvements.</div>
