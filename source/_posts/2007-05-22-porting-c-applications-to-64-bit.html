A couple of recent articles on the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com">CodeProject</a> cover the porting of applications to 64-bit.  It does mention the datatype problem where the size changes.<br /><br />The first one is <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/Test_64-bit_applications.asp">Problems Of Testing 64-bit Applications</a>.  The second is <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/20ISSUES64BIT.asp">20 issues of porting C++ code on the 64-bit platform</a>.<br /><br />The second one is the more comprehensive and provides practical solutions to the problem.</div>
