The developers here at [Camvine][1] have held on to the [Camvine Twitter Feed][2] for two weeks now with ten examples of cool uses of the [CODA digital signage system][3].

Here is a run-down of the ten so far:  
#1 &#8211; [Get live updates from your Twitter feed displayed on the wall!][4]  
#2 &#8211; [Get up-to-date feeds from popular photo sharing sites on your wall by using photocasts!][5]  
#3 &#8211; [Real time network monitoring at a glance using CODA to display Pingdom reports!][6]  
#4 &#8211; [Get calendars out of the computer and to where they can be seen and matter.][7]  
#5 &#8211; [For very busy people &#8211; put your inbox status on a display in your office!][8]  
#6 &#8211; [Email your wall &#8211; a quick way for getting messages to all!][9]  
#7 &#8211; [Keep abreast of what&#8217;s going on with RSS feeds in CODA!][10]  
#8 &#8211; [Make it easier to track software development projects with CODA!][11]  
#9 &#8211; [Themed random photo mosaics using Flickr tags to generate art on your screens.][12]  
#10 &#8211; [Monitor your website&#8217;s readership stats in real time via Feedburner and CODA!][13]

There are a number of interesting bits of source code to come out of this which I&#8217;ll cover in my next post.
