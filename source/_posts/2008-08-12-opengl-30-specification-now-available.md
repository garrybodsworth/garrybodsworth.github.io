I used to track what was going on in [OpenGL][1] very closely because I was in the CAD/CAM industry and 3D graphics are important there. It doesn&#8217;t seem that the changes were as radical as everyone was expecting as it was mentioned that there was a new object model being designed (I seem to remember [blogging about it][2] nearly two years ago).

You can see the proposed specification from the [OpenGL Pipeline Newsletter 004][3].

Apparently certain developers are furious about it with some very long and vitriolic discussions. If you really want to inflict them on your brain you can see them [here][4], [here][5], and [here][6]. It seems the games developers are making the CAD industry scapegoats for any of the problems with the process.

It may not be the radical change but it is at least incremental, and provides a basis to deprecate and add some functionality. I still like the simplicity of using OpenGL, but then again I was never trying out any of the cutting edge features available on the graphics cards. OpenGL and OpenGL|ES are still being used on the Mac, Linux/Unix derivatives, Nintendo (DS and Wii), Playstation, and the iPhone.

You can check out a summaries [here][7] and [here][8] for the main changes with the full spec [here (PDF)][9].
