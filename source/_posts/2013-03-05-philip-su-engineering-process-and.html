Last week I was representing Bromium at the Hacker News London event, and there was an excellent talk by Philip Su from Facebook's London office. &nbsp;It was about the engineering culture at Facebook and how they have kept it working up to their current 1000 engineers. &nbsp;Whatever you think of Facebook this is a great window into how they have kept the engineering culture thriving and fully operational despite the issues of engineer numbers and the scale of their operations.<br /><br />Also, Philip Su is a really great speaker.<br /><br />&nbsp;  <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" mozallowfullscreen="" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/60896034" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"></iframe><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/60896034">Philip Su: Site Lead at Facebook - Engineering process and philosophy at Facebook</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/hnlondon">HN London</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</div>
