<a href="http://www.codeblocks.org">Code::Blocks</a> is a free open-source IDE written in <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a>, making good use of <a href="http://www.kirix.com/community/wxaui.html">wxAUI</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxflatnotebook">wxFlatNoteBook</a>.<br /><br />If you decide to give it a go make sure you use the <a href="http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=d5fa3b82510a71c14c07404cb09e1492&board=20.0">Nightly Builds</a>, you'll need <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> to decompress the files as well.  The nightly builds are well beyond the last "release" called RC2.  I've found the nightly builds stable and mature.  There are lots of plug-ins and project templates.<br /><br />One of the major plug-ins that has recently gone through a major rewrite is the wxSmith plug-in which is a visual GUI designer for the IDE.  If this turns out to be good or even just average it would give Code::Blocks a major advantage for adoption.<br /><br />Code::Blocks is able to be the IDE for a variety of <a href="http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php?title=Installing_a_supported_compiler">compiler back-ends</a>.  I completely forgot to mention it is cross-platform.  It seems to scale up pretty well to larger projects, and can even convert your Visual Studio solutions.<br /><br />It also provides scripting through <a href="http://www.squirrel-lang.org">Squirrel</a>/<a href="http://wiki.squirrel-lang.org/default.aspx/SquirrelWiki/SqPlus.html">SqPlus</a> (which I've mentioned I like in a previous post).<br /><br />I must confess I am not currently using it, but I am using the Visual C++ Express Edition.  The only excuse I have is that I have Visual C++ set up perfectly for what I want to do.  If you are curious go and check it out, you won't be disappointed.</div>

Yep, this is a pretty good IDE. If you develop with MinGW, this is THE IDE to use. I've never run it on Linux or OSX, so I can't speak for those.<br /><br />But, I'm with you, VC++2005 is my favorite.</div>
