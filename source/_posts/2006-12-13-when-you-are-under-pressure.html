Sometimes at work it just happens you are so under pressure non-stop that any hope for decent practices are out of the window and there is a constant flurry of mounting problems at your doorstep.<br /><br />Joel On Software has a little test to see just how good your work environment is for good coding.  You can see it <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">here</a>.  Go ahead work out where your company lies on the scale, 10 or lower are defined as serious problems.<br /><br />Sometimes these types of problems you can turn around with a bit of hard work.  It is not always possible though - but you have to try.  Joel also has another article about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000332.html">Getting Things Done When You Are A Grunt</a>.  This suggests it is possible to improve standards even if you are not overly experienced or not very high up.  You can also view the related discussion <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=2033">here</a>.<br /><br />It is easy for the process to overtake the coding though - and you must always keep that in check somehow when you open this Pandora's Box - or you can spend your entire time only on that.  This isn't good for you and not good for your colleagues.  I think if you work at a 0 rated place then it must be simple to get a few points added to the rating.</div>
