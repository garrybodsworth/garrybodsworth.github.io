I blogged a while back about the secret MFC features for VS2008 (MFC v9) <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/10/gui-toolkits-mfc-v9-visual-studio-2008.html">here</a>.  The information was going to appear at Microsoft Technet Europe 2007in a talk by Ale Contenti.<br /><br />Well, I think the talk must have now happened as there are a few posts out here on the Internet about it.<br /><br />You can read one <a href="http://blog.kalmbach-software.de/2007/11/07/mfcupdate-mfc-now-has-a-visual-manager-and-will-add-office-2007-ribbon-controls-and-many-more-features/">here</a> and another <a href="http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.m-ri.de%2Findex.php%2F2007%2F11%2F07%2Fmfc-updates-for-visual-studio-2008-and-beyond-mfcnext%2F&langpair=de|en&hl=en&ie=UTF8">translated here</a>.<br /><br />It amounts to lots of good stuff for native C++ developers on Windows:<br />* Docking windows<br />* Tabbed MDI<br />* Office 2007 theme<br />* Ribbon interface (no visual designer yet though)<br />* Lots of new controls<br />* Skins<br />* Vista specific enhancements<br />* And plenty more...<br /><br />I actually can't wait to get my hands on this and have a play, unfortunately we do have to wait until next month for a release candidate as it will be an add-on.  The interesting thing is the visual styles manager which will allow switching visual styles at runtime.<br /><br />Apparently there will be a Channel 9 video soon that should appear <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showforum.aspx?forumid=14&tagid=17">here</a>.</div>
