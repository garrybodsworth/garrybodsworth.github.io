An interesting article came up on <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk">The Register</a> about the Adobe development process.  It covers the approach applied for Adobe CS3 and how it was successful.  Really it was an application of iterative development.  You can read the article <a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2007/03/08/adobe_cs3_development/">here</a>.</div>
