Write a Cocoa application, create a new target and compile it for Windows. Easy as that. The [Cocotron][1] project gives the opportunity for developers to do just that.

There is a good in-depth blog post [here][2]. The developers of [FileMagnet][3] decided they wanted a Windows version and it took them two months with Cocotron and no Visual Studio at all.

What with Objective-J and Cocotron you could program for the web or Windows or Linux and never get too far away from the frameworks of Apple.
