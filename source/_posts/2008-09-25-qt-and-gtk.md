For a couple of weeks I have been playing around with Qt and GTK+ at fairly low levels, attempting to get some low level pixels and other things.

What I discovered on these travels is that Qt is much faster to get up and running (with a simpler build system that works more or less straight away) whereas GTK+ is much more difficult to get started with (unless you are using the packages supplied with your distro).

Then it swings back the other way because with Qt you have less access to the low level functionality or those types of interfaces that are exposed are not quite powerful enough. With GTK+ it certainly seems a bit more configurable in that respect, say for writing a new backend.

A good piece of news about GTK+ is that there is now a native OSX version [GTK+OSX][1].

Also, an enterprising developer has created a new indirect rendering backend with no reliance on an X-server (very handy for testing and the suchlike) which can be found [here][2]. The GTK Indirect Renderer sends the pixels to a Cairo surface so you can wrap them round strange OpenGL things or put them in SDL.
