There has been no blogging for a couple of weeks because I was on holiday in America, then ill.  But now it is time to get back to blogging since plenty has happened in the world of computers during my break.  I have some emails to reply to from the blog and I will get around to those over the next few days.<br /><br />The best thing about going to America was to get a nice new Macbook Pro - one of the new revisions with the LED backlight.  The model I got was the bottom of the range 2.2GHz Core 2 Duo (4MB cache) 15 inch version, which now comes with 120GB of hard drive.<br /><br />The LED backlight has substantially increased the battery life of the Macbook Pros and the picture quality is astounding.  I got the matte look screen as it provides much better colour tones at a lesser intensity.<br /><br />And OS X - I should never have waited this long to switch to anything other than Windows.  It is astoundingly good.<br /><br />There will probably be more Mac content on the blog in the future but I will still be using Windows in other places so I will still be interested in development on that platform, but probably with a more cross-platform slant.</div>

I haven't got around to installing Ubuntu yet.  If it is painless I might give it a go.</div>

Yep - I recently got a MacBook (not pro) as my new laptop. The hardware is not only better designed, but it is also CHEAPER than equivalent spec PCs.<BR/><BR/>And it runs Ubuntu just as well!</div>
