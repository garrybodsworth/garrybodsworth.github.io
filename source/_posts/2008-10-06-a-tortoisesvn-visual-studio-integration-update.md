I&#8217;ve just done a minor update to the TortoiseSVN Visual Studio integration. It&#8217;s nothing too major and if they are already working for you don&#8217;t bother with the update.

The only change is to make the *c:\Program Files\* point at *%PROGRAMFILES%* so if you have a non English Windows or Program Files is somewhere different then you should be ableto avoid fiddling with it. Thanks to [Fabian][1] for the suggestion.

You can download the settings [here][2].
