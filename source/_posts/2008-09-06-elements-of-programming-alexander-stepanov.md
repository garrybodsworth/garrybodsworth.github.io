[Alexander Stepanov][1] (the brains behind the C++ Standard Library) has just posted the latest draft of the first five chapters of his upcoming book &#8220;Foundations Of Programming&#8221; which is co-authored by Paul McJones. You can view the PDF [here][2].

He currently works at Adobe and has a remit for providing the formalisation of generic programming techniques. This work also provides the basis for the [Adobe ASL][3] open-source C++ libraries.

At the [ACCU][4] Conference earlier this year I attended the the Adobe ASL talks hosted by Sean Parent, where he said about giving Stepanov the job of formalising the ideas behind generic programming. You can read my write-up of the talk [here][5]. I found the talk eye opening and interesting and the ideas behind the approach give them a very solid foundation for reusable components.
