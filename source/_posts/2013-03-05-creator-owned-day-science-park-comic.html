<br />Creator Owned Day was started by <a href="http://www.stephendowneygallery.com/2013/02/creator-owned-day-2013.html">Stephen Downey here</a> and its primary purpose is for creators to start new ideas and not simply dream of working on corporate owned comics. &nbsp;You can follow it by on <a href="https://twitter.com/creatorownedday">Twitter @CreatorOwnedDay</a> or the hashtag #CreatorOwnedDay. &nbsp;Also check out the great list of <a href="http://www.amberunmasked.com/2013-creatorownedday/">creator owned comics here</a>.<br /><br />Since I am off work I decided to participate this year, which is great synchronicity otherwise I'd never get around to drawing again. &nbsp;And for some reason rather than just creating a character I went the whole "high concept" route, nothing like over-stretching. &nbsp;Seems I have finished more or less by lunch time.<br /><br />So here it is....<br /><h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Science Park</span></h3><div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garrybodsworth/8530244343/" title="sciencepark by Garry Bodsworth, on Flickr"><img alt="sciencepark" height="500" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8087/8530244343_2a3e6252aa.jpg" width="369" /></a><br /><div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div>A technology park just outside Cambridge located in a hollowed out mountain and deep towards the Earth's crust. &nbsp;Rental rates are pretty good and there are a wide choice of office sizes. &nbsp;The park is privately funded by The L Corporation and their mysterious CEO who lives and works in the penthouse suite at the top of the mountain.<br /><h4>Tenants include:</h4><b>Immutable Corporation</b><br /><b>Motto:</b> We've Always Been Here<br /><b>Employees:</b> 4000<br /><b>Specialities:</b> Computer equipment<br /><b>CEO:</b> Dr Monolith<br /><br /><b>B.I.O.</b><br /><b>Motto:</b> Recreating The Past<br /><b>Employees:</b> 10,000<br /><b>Specialities:</b> Bio-tech<br /><b>CEO:</b> Mr Silence PhD (please contact his PA Mr D Lackey)<br /><h4>Rival Science Parks:</h4>Giant Robo Science Park<br /><b>Advantages:</b> Mobile<br /><b>Disadvantages:</b> Mobile, you might lose your office.<br />Giant Robo Science Park is the latest state of the art giant robot with an attitude problem. &nbsp;Loaded with weaponry enjoys spending its days blowing holes in the hollowed out mountain.<br /><br />Ignore the giant hands, I'm sure that it is just a cloud formation.<br /><br /><h3>Why Did I Do This?</h3>This is always a case of stick to what you know, and my intention was to do something based aroud the technology industry. &nbsp;Judging from what I have created it is not necessarily based on real-life, and the irony of a mountain in Cambridgeshire is extreme. &nbsp;I apologise for the Kirby-isms, the dinosaur was not supposed to look that Kirby-like, I promise I have never read Devil Dinosaur (something I do plan to rectify). &nbsp;The giant robot is also my way of shoehorning my addiction to Transformers in there.<br /><br />What do I want to do next? &nbsp;I hope I can find the time to work on this as it has given me focus for ideas.</div></div>
