Michael Dunn has posted anotehr Vista native API tutorial about <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/winfx/VGPowerMonitor.asp">monitoring the system's power</a>.  It is obviously not as whizz-bang as the first tutorial, but this is excellent stuff as I hope it means C/C++ developers are going to have a real go at messing around with the native API.<br /><br />There is an excellent and massive post from <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/08/10/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-3-_1320_-The-Desktop-Window-Manager.aspx">Kenny Kerr available from this link</a>.  Make sure you check that out as well.<br /><br />I've now installed the Windows SDK (I think they call the Win32 API the Windows API now, but there is no definitive answer as Microsoft want to encourage people to use other technologies).</div>
