A difficulty with any company is keeping up that spirit of innovation when it is established. Different companies approach is in different ways or even not at all, so it is always interesting to hear how they approach it.

One of my favourite articles of recent times (which inspired the title of this post) is [Pixar&#8217;s Brad Bird on Fostering Innovation][1].

There is a great quote from Steve Jobs in the article:

> Jobs told him: “The only thing we’re afraid of is complacency—feeling like we have it all figured out,” Bird quotes his boss as saying “…We want you to come shake things up.”

Brad Bird provides nine lessons, which although are for a creative animation company, are generally applicable. My favourite one is the first lesson, &#8220;Herd your black sheep&#8221;, which involves finding the artists with ideas for making things better, and allowing them to express their ideas.

I think in the world of computer development the lesson &#8220;Perfect is the Enemy of Innovation&#8221; is important, because the quest for perfect perfection takes your eyes off the ball of actually delivering something. Other ideas from the article is to discuss publicly within a team to interconnect everyone&#8217;s strengths, and high morale makes creativity (and by that token productivity) cheap.

&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to protect your success&#8221; is not immediately obvious, but I guess simply trading one-upmanship with a competitor doesn&#8217;t give you any innovation. &#8220;Interaction = Innovation&#8221;, is another about communication by encouraging not just team communication but interdisciplinary communication, people should not be cordoned off in their own little world.

[Google 20% time][2] is the obvious example of attempting to foster innovation. Projects such as GMail, Google News, [MacFUSE][3] grew out of it. It is certainly one of the most talked about aspects of having a job at Google. Recently there have been rumours from places like Valleywag saying that 20% time is being cracked down on with areas like &#8220;Google Mail Labs&#8221; being started to give developers a sandbox for which to experiment with rather than having carte blanche. I think certainly more experienced developers probably find it easier to get more out-of-the-box ideas okayed though, but then again that doesn&#8217;t make such linkable headlines.

Another approach to this was used by Disney&#8217;s Black Rock Studios. They hosted a Minigame Week which was outlined in a two part interview with [Develop Magazine][4] with [part one here][5] and [part two here][6].

The idea within the studio was to spend some time being creative and make a minigame in a week as a team building exercise. This involved the entire company of about 120 people. An interesting part was that it allowed people who don&#8217;t traditionally work together to do so, and they also found leaders that they did not know about before.

The second part of the interview contains a developer&#8217;s diary of the week&#8217;s work. Rather scarily it ends in the crescendo on Friday afternoon presentations which must be nerve-racking to get the demo to work in a week&#8230; It sounds like it was hard work but sometimes these things don&#8217;t tire you out and invigorate you.

Going to conferences/conventions are those kind of invigorating events and I wish I could bottle that feeling. You talk to lots of people get loads of ideas then the feeling gradually dissipates over the following weeks.

I think all of this is more about the people rather than the end product. It has to be kept going even through the difficult times because it is part of the company culture and the moment it stops the goodwill dissipates quickly. These companies have found ways to do it right and I think any application of the the same ideals needs to be tailored for what the company is trying to achieve, hence the minigame for games companies.
