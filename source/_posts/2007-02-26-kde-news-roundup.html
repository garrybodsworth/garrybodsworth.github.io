All very exciting leading up to the eventual release of KDE4 which is shaping up to be pretty impressive.<br /><br /><a href="http://enzosworld.gmxhome.de/">Dolphin</a> has made its way into kdebase.  There is talk of it now becoming the new default file manager.<br /><br />The <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1172083974/">new KDE build system</a> which uses <a href="http://cmake.org/">CMake</a> which is a fantastic open-source project.<br /><br />The third KDE4 development snapshot has been released which has been christened <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1172249109/">Kludge</a> (I don't know if that is better than Krash ;) ).<br /><br />There is a possibility there could be a <a href="http://webkit.org/">WebKit</a> based Qt browser <a href="http://zrusin.blogspot.com/2007/02/browsers-performance-and-interventions.html">in the works</a>.<br /><br />There is a bit of news about Krita, the image manipulation program in KDE, for the upcoming KDE4 <a href="http://www.valdyas.org/fading/index.cgi/hacking/krita/kritashape.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.valdyas.org/fading/index.cgi/hacking/krita/progress_2007_2.comments">here</a>.</div>
