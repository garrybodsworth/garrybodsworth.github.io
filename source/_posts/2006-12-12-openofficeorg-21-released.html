<div class='post'>
The latest version of <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> has been released.  This is now version 2.1 with a host of new features.  You can see all the release notes <a href="http://development.openoffice.org/releases/2.1.0.html">here</a>.<br /><br />The main thrust of this version is to help push the <a href="http://extensions.openoffice.org/">extension technologies</a> (which originally appeared in 2.0.4).  They are trying to encourage the same level of extensions as with Firefox, whether this succeeds or not only time will tell.<br /><br />I've used OpenOffice.org since the betas of version 2 and it has always been solid and consistent, and I never fell into the trap I did with Microsoft Office where page formatting could change randomly.  The features of OpenOffice are more than adequate for all the uses that I have had for it (and it has meant that I don't have to buy an MS Office licence).  I've used it for generating PDFs for printing magazines and it does the job fantastically.</div>
