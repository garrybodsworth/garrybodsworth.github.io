<div class='post'>
During numerous hours of websurfing I stumbled across the <a href="http://oglwfw.sourceforge.net">OpenGL Window Framework</a>.  This is a thin layer on top of OpenGL to make extra nice for C++ developers.  Unfortunately it does not seem to be actively developed.<br /><br />What it provides is a nice C++ interface for OpenGL with respect for making window contexts.  It gives you access to extensions via the <a href="http://elf-stone.com/glee.php">Glee</a> library.  It gives you an enumeration framework for modes and features, and also there are design considerations for multi-threaded programming which is important in this day and age.<br /><br />It's a very tightly focussed library designed for making using OpenGL and creating the windows for it much easier, and it seems to do that pretty well.</div>
