I didn't even realise until just now, 50 posts down and still no idea what I should be concentrating on.  Obviously this blog has a real GUI flavour, but I can't help writing about random computer subjects like media PCs and interesting new things.<br /><br />I still haven't finished my trek through the new world of Vista.  Not only the guidelines, but also getting a more in-depth look at the C API headers and getting some documentation together about it.<br /><br />There are also some GUI toolkits I haven't got round to looking at like the <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/">Adobe Open-Source Libraries</a> and <a href="http://smartwin.sourceforge.net/">SmartWin++</a>.  Also, I still feeel like I need to look at lots of the others in more depth.  And most importantly I want to get some source code out there rather than just talking about it all the time ;)<br /><br />Anyway, here is to the next 50 posts.</div>
