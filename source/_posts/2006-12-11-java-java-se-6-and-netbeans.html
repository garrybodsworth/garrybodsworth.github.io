<div class='post'>
Sun have <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/">released Java SE 6</a> the latest version of Java for use in developing desktop and server applications.  This isn't the GPLed version just yet as the development of version 6 just missed the boat.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.netbeans.org/products/">NetBeans is also available</a> as a free IDE for development.  It is an excellent quality IDE which now has a <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/products/cplusplus/">C/C++ plug-in</a>.  The C/C++ plugin is a bit new so it is not perfect by any means, but has just as much potential as the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">Eclipse CDT</a> project.<br /><br />I am going to try out more Java programming to see how far the GUI was away from looking platform native.  Hopefully, it is not too far away right now.</div>
