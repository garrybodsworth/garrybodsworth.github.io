<div class='post'>
A while back I found a really great website for game development libraries.  What I found was that these libraries are useful for development full-stop.  So go check it out at the <a href="http://abattoir.wolfpaw.net/personal/gamelibs.php">Free Game Development Libraries website</a>.<br /><br />If you are interested in programming you will find some libraries you knew about and some that you never knew existed.  Also along with breaking the libraries down by functionality it also specifies the licence type.</div>
