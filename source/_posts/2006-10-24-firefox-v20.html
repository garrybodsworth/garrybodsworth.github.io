<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> is addictive, and gives a wealth of useful information, like 75% of the readers here use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Firefox</a>.  Firefox 2.0 comes the same week as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0</a> has arrived.  So there are two installation experiences to tell.<br /><br />IE7 starts installation by unpacking the installation to a temporary directory, and then begins some enforced Windows Updates.  Then it begins an unusually long installation (I am still not sure why), overall taking 10-15 minutes.  Then it needs you to reboot.<br /><br />I was going to wait for automatic updates to pick up Firefox 2.0, but I decided to upgrade now.  The installation was a case of blink and you'll miss it.  No reboot.  A minor startup delay of about ten seconds due to checking the plug-ins for updates, and I was away.  The new UI takes a bit of getting used to visually, but I think I will end up preferring it, and it pretty much all works the same.  The tab shading is a bit unnecessary especially since the rest of the UI isn't as shaded.
