[Bar-Camb 2 is this Friday][1]  
An open social wiki-like conference. It should be really interesting to see what subjects appear on the day. Also, I haven&#8217;t got the faintest clue what I could present&#8230;

[ACCU 2009 Conference &#8211; Call For Participants][3]  
A great technical conference run by [ACCU][4]. They (maybe that should be &#8220;we&#8221; since I am a member) are looking for willing victims (speakers) for next year&#8217;s.

[It&#8217;s 1975 And This Man Is About To Show You The Future][5]  
(Scenes From An IBM Slide Presentation)  
Is it genius or madness?

[Moffat talks Doctor Who at Comicon][6]  
Because everyone in the UK is now officially obsessed by The Doctor.

[Damon Albarn&#8217;s and Jamie Hewlett&#8217;s BBC Olympics Monkey][7]  
The new Olympic adverts are all over the BBC now, and Jamie Hewlett has provided something truly worth watching.

[Origin Of Superman Villains &#8211; McCay Style][8]  
Beautiful renditions of the origins of some of Superman&#8217;s rogue&#8217;s gallery by Stuart Immonen. What makes it different is that they are rendered in the style of Winsor McCay&#8217;s Little Nemo in Slumberland. Who said the 90s were a cultural wasteland?
