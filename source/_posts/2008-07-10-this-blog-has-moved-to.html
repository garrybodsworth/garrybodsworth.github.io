<div class='post'>
Hi everyone. <br/><br/>This blog has now moved to <a href="http://blog.programmerslog.com/">Programmer's Log</a> at its own domain using Wordpress.  The content of this blog will remain, but all new posts will be made at the <a href="http://blog.programmerslog.com/">Programmer's Log</a>.  I've already posted a minor update to the TortoiseSVN Visual Studio integration. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading all this time on Blogger.  I have made just over 300 posts and I'm not planning on stopping there, so I hope you can join me. <br/><br/>Oh yes, and don't forget to check out my new employer's website <a href="http://www.camvine.com/">Cambridge Visual Networks (Camvine)</a>. <br/><br/>Thanks again,<br/>Garry Bodsworth</div>
