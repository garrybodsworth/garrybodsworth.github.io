A few months back 280 North released an online presentation presentation tool called [280 Slides][1]. The most impressive aspect of which was the user interface that mimicked a full desktop application in look and feel. At the time they promised that the framework used for this (written in Javascript) was going to be released under an open-source licence.

[Objective-J and Cappuccino][2] have now been released under the LGPL licence. The Cappuccino website is [here][3] with lots of information and documentation.

The framework itself is really designed for writing proper applications in the web browser like GMail and 280 Slides rather than simply adding interactivity to web pages. Objective-J provides the basis of the &#8220;language&#8221; adding more features to Javascript non-invasively, then Cappuccino is built on top of it and is more or less a port of the GNUStep/Cocoa frameworks.

It will be interesting to see other applications written with these technologies and to see how the way applications in the web browser could change with it. If you look at 280 Slides it is really impressive and now I have tried it in Firefox 3.0 it is really quite snappy (when I tried it a while back in Firefox 2.0 it was a bit more sluggish). This also becomes even more interesting with the new Javascript advancements being made by various browsers like TraceMonkey (Firefox 3.1), SquirrelFish (Safari 4.0), and [V8][4] (Google&#8217;s Chrome).
