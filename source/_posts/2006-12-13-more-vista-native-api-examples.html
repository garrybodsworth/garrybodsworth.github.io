<div class='post'>
On the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com">CodeProject</a> there are a couple more articles about using the Vista Native API, which is actually accessing the base API through C++, bypassing the need for .NET.<br /><br />The first article is <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/vista/VGFileDialogs.asp">Using the New Vista File Dialogs</a>.  This is actually written with <a href="http://wtl.sourceforge.net/">WTL</a> in mind, but the ideas are the same whatever you are using, so long as you can access the API.  So you can now add the new Vista file dialogs to your current programs.<br /><br />The second article is <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/vista/VGTaskDialog.asp">Showing Friendly Messages with Task Dialogs</a>.  This exposes the new TaskDialog API which Microsoft want people to use for displaying information to users.  It's all fairly simple, so it is extra Vista in your program for not too much effort.</div>
