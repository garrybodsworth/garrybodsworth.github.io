[Whitix][1] is a new desktop operating system that has just released a [0.2 version][2]. I hadn&#8217;t heard of it until today but it is interesting to see a few other operating systems out there.

It is aimed more at desktop users rather than techies as an ultimate goal. Still, it is early days and requires hacking abilities to be able to use it.

Essentially it is a new kernel written in C with some libraries ported to it to provide other functionality. The kernel itself is based mainly on Unix ideas but has decided to move some bits around to be more intuitive (like /usr/bin/ and the suchlike).

The graphics are based on [xynth][3]. The [screenshots][4] look pretty good.

Obviously, it&#8217;s early days for the Whitix project but it should be interesting to see what it offers in the long term and how it differentiates itself as it matures.
