I only started using [WordPress][1] last week and I have been completely in awe of its features and how much it is a step forward from Blogger.

Now a week later my Dashboard is informing me WordPress 2.6 is out and did I want to upgrade. The new features include:

*   Post revisions &#8211; so you can get wiki-like tracking of changes.
*   Press This! &#8211; So you can blog from anywhere on the web and do instant embedding of Flickr and YouTube content.
*   Gears &#8211; It now makes use of Google&#8217;s Gears to help speed up via caching.
*   Theme previews &#8211; You can try out themes before they are publicly seen on your site.
*   Word count &#8211; for those who want endless statistics.
*   Image captions.
*   Improvements to plug-in management.

I used the [instant upgrade plug-in][2] for WordPress, and it was painless and fast. It is really easy to upgrade now which is fantastic when you are managing your own website.
