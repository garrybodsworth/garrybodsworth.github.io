Lots of comics/movies/cool stuff links building up.

[Dead Snow][1]  
Zombie Nazis in the snow! &#8216;Nuff said.

[LADRÖNN interview [1]][2] and [LADRÖNN interview [2]][3]  
One of my favourite artists doing comics right now. He has a European style percolated through Jack Kirby. His full colour art is a joy and the fact he is working on Metabarons can only be seen as a good thing.

[Alex Cox Interviews Fred Van Lente][4]  
An interview with the creator of Action Philosophers and Comic Book Comics (how has it taken so long for someone to tell the history of comics in comics????)

[PAT MILLS THE GENERAL IN CHARLEY&#8217;S WAR][5]  
He started 2000AD, he writes brilliant comics, I don&#8217;t normally see many interviews with him though.

[Watchmen Collection][6]  
Random artwork from and inspired by Watchmen.

[The Making Of Dune II][7]  
I lost countless hours of my life to this game and I don&#8217;t feel one ounce of guilt.

[Weekend Briefing at MI-6][8]  
Some cool pulp-y James Bond artwork and some not so good artwork.

[Frighteners][9]  
More Oliver Frey artwork &#8211; all kids from the 1980s would recognise his old computer game covers.

[For Science!][10]  
Character designs for the Transformers Animated Series, some classics slightly re-imagined.

[Horror Top Trumps][11]  
Fu Manchu will totally kick the backside of a Sierra Cosworth in your Boy Racer Top Trumps.

[Game Parlor of the Future (1982)][12]  
The predictions are sometimes correct&#8230;
