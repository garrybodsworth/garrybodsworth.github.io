Part of the reason I have been so quiet recently isn't just getting old and turning 30, or even the Norovirus I managed to catch in time to blow the bowels out of Christmas.  The main reason is that I had my head down before starting a new job.<br /><br />Today was my first day at <a href="http://www.displaylink.com">Displaylink</a> which is a rapidly expanding display technology company in Cambridge who are good enough to host the <a href="http://www.accu.org">ACCU Meetings</a>.<br /><br />Hopefully I can now get back to a normal blogging service now all of the upheaval should be coming to an end.  I had a good seven and a bit years working on the same codebase and hopefully have contributed some decent things to those companies.  It was always a shame to say goodbye to <a href="http://www.ncgraphics.net">NC Graphics</a> when PTC took over, but it also helped me to decide to try something new.<br /><br />Now I can't see it as a conflict of interest I should do some CAM blogging although it would never be as good as <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/index.php">Julian Todd's</a> and I would be approaching it from a higher level perspective.</div>
