Here are the details:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Windows Presentation Foundation</span><br /><br />Ian Griffiths Interact Software Limited<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Synopsis</span><br /><br />Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a platform for building Windows desktop applications that can take full advantage of the graphical capabilities of modern PCs. Whereas many UI frameworks in the past have merely added yet another layer of abstraction on what was there before, WPF is radically different from its predecessors. This talk will discuss what possessed Microsoft to abandon the strategy of incremental tinkering that has served them well for over 20 years of Windows application development. WPF shifts away from many of the fundamental mechanisms that had been in place since the first version of Windows, and we will explore the new possibilities this creates.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Speaker Biography</span><br /><br />Ian Griffiths is an independent WPF consultant, developer, speaker and Pluralsight instructor and a widely recognized expert on the subject. He lives in London but can often be found on various developer mailing lists and newsgroups, where a popular sport is to see who can get him to write the longest email in reply to the shortest possible question. Ian maintains a <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">popular blog</a> and is co-author of "Windows Forms in a Nutshell" and of "Mastering Visual Studio .NET".</div>
