I've been using Firefox 3 on the Mac for the past month so I thought I'd share some of my experiences when using it.  There release candidate download page is <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-rc.html">here</a>.<br /><br />The reason I didn't start using it beforehand was because I was waiting for a supported version of the <a href="http://www.delicious.com">Del.icio.us</a> bookmarks add-on as it has become indespensible to me.  You can get this <a href="http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2008/04/firefox-3-delicious-and-you.html">here</a>.<br /><br />I run a few add-ons to make it look more integrated with Mac OSX:<br />* <a href="http://en.design-noir.de/mozilla/locationbar2/">Locationbar 2</a> for improving the recognition of URLs.<br />* <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1951">Fission</a> for the progress in the URL field like Safari.<br />* <a href="http://www.takebacktheweb.org/">GrApple Delicious (Blue)</a> theme which looks very good (and integrated on the Mac).<br />* And don't forget <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865">AdBlock Plus</a> whichever platform you are running on!<br /><br />With all of those add-ons working (you can also force add-ons to work by using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6543">Nightly Tester Tools</a>) I was ready to use Firefox 3.  For a Beta (and now the Release Candidate) it is amazingly stable.<br /><br />The entire program is much more responsive and lighter on the system resources.  The integration and look and feel (with the add-ons) is excellent, although I would prefer if spell-checking with edit fields to be on by default (although there is a hack <a href="http://www.osxdaily.com/2007/06/06/enable-spell-checking-in-firefox-text-input-fields/">here</a>).<br /><br />In general it is a large step forward although I am not using the biggest new feature - the bookmarks replacement "Places".  As usual though the major feather in Firefox's cap is the add-ons and once you have them you find it impossible to use anything else.<br /><br />Also, I am using it on Windows Vista at work and it is fast, responsive and looks much better, although I would prefer not to have the blue tinge to the window.  I'd recommend upgrading now because once you've tried 3 you can't go back.</div>
