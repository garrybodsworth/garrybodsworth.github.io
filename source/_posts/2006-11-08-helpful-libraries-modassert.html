<div class='post'>
Anyone who has programmed in MFC and ATL will have encountered the ASSERT macro.  Due to it being rather simplistic and essentially a one-size-fits-all.<br /><br />I was pleased to see someone has developed a very comprehensive assertion library which makes it into a really useful debugging tool.  I first encountered the project with <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/library/ModAssert.asp">this article on CodeProject</a>.  It allows compile time disabling/compiling out, and also run time diabling.  It also provides levels to give a granularity to your debug output.  Also you can use it to output log information which can be invaluable for debugging (with lots of useful information like threads and so on).<br /><br />The library is fairly large and comprehensive, but since you should compile it out for your final release build it isn't really a problem at all.  It certainly should be useful for C++ developers.<br /><br />The Sourceforge Project is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/modassert/">here</a>.</div>
