[How is Google’s v8 Javascript as an ingame Scripting Language][2]

Tikitag is a RFID tag system that looks very modern and web 2.0.

[Cocoa Touch Tutorial: iPhone Application Example][4]  
A nice quick iPhone application tutorial.

The upcoming version of the image editor for the Mac.

[smush.it][7]  
A web service to help you optimise your images for the web.
