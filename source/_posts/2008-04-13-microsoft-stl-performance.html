On the <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> discussion group there is a discussion started about <a href="http://www.nabble.com/High-Cost-of-MS-"Safe"-STL-for-Release-Builds-td16642449.html#a16642449">High Cost of MS "Safe" STL for Release Builds</a>.  It is an interesting look at the massive differences between "safe" and "non-safe" options in Microsoft STL.<br /><br />I don't think there has been a clear look at the efficiencies and inefficiencies in the MS-STL implementation, especially with the different options (iterator debugging and safe options).  There have been some looks at comparing different STL implementations but it always difficult to do a good comparison, the main problem being comparing the correct "latest versions".<br /><br />Going back a while I was justifying the use of <a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net/">STLPort</a> instead of Microsoft STL supplied with Visual Studio.  Simply, it was a performance thing with both memory and efficiency.  Certainly with the new STLPort visualisers for the Microsoft debugger it is an even playing field for ease of use.<br /><br />You can read those here:<br />* <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/visual-studio-2005-lets-break.html">Visual Studio 2005 - Lets Break Everything!</a> - a bit about how to switch off some of the more annoying "features".<br />* <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/01/development-stlport-versus-microsoft.html">Development - STLPort versus Microsoft STL performance</a> - A quick summary of my observations on the performance in a real-world complex application.<br />* <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/01/more-on-stlport-and-microsoft-stl.html">More on STLPort and Microsoft STL performance</a> - A little more background.</div>
