<div class='post'>
There is an interesting <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html">article here</a> about the design architecture for GUIs.  This applies more to the rich clients with database backends, but I think it is more than relevant for designing an application as it would be able to scale in the future much more easily.<br /><br />The obvious subject it covers is MVC (Model-View-Controller).  The article is kept fairly up to date as well with an update the middle of this year.</div>
