There are a couple of talks coming up in Cambridge in the next couple of weeks.  We're lucky here in Cambridge that there is anything like this to go to as I can't find many instances of this throughout the country.<br /><br />First up we have <a href="http://accu.org">ACCU</a> a group striving for professionalism in programming (and there is a fair amount of emphasis on C++).  They have journals released regularly throughout the year which makes membership pretty worthwhile (also membership gives you access to the entire archive online).<br /><br />7:00pm Thursday 6th September 2007 - Peter Smith: The Missing Link, the role of a linker within a software development.  You can sign up to the talk at this <a href="http://www.accu.org/index.php/accu_branches/accu_cambridge">link</a>.<br /><br />Next up is the BCS SPA are going to start there monthly talk programme again after a summer break.  At the moment the talk next week is not known but you can keep an eye out <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SPACambridgeEveningMeetingProgramme">here</a>.<br /><br />Interestingly there will be a talk from <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">Ian Griffiths</a> about WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) on the 14th November.  He is one of the architects behind the whole new graphics interface in Vista.</div>

I've put up a review of the recent ACCU talk about linkers.  The ACCU talks are definitely the most interesting since they are more technical in nature.<BR/><BR/>The first I've heard of this PTC event was from you just now(!)  I notice there is no mention of Pro/TOOLMAKER...  I don't think developers are part of this event.</div>
