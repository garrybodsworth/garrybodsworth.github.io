I wanted to use WordPress for my blog, hence abandoning Blogspot, but I needed to find a hosting service that would allow me to do so.

I did lots of searching and decided to steer well clear of the cheap&#8217;n'cheerful hosts because I could read too many horror stories about them. Also, I wanted a UK host so support is on the same time zone as my existence as I am one of the strange computer types who doesn&#8217;t work on nocturnal hours.

After much searching I found a smaller company called [Clook][1] which had some good reviews mainly about the service. I bit the bullet and got the shared server package which was reasonably priced (Â£50 + VAT for the year).

What has really impressed me about them is how good their service is. When you have a problem they are quick and responsive and have a real grasp of how to actually fix things. They even helped me sort out the dead-brained error I had made installing WordPress.

The hosting provides all the features you could want when setting up a website with [cPanel][2] and [Fantastico][3]. You have the usual suspects running on Linux, Python, PHP, Perl, MySQL, and you can probably request some custom work if necessary. You also get backups and cron jobs.

So to sum up [Clook][1], they have reasonable prices, excellent service, and provide some compelling features.
