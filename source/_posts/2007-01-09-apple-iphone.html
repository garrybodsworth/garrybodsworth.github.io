The new <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone">Apple iPhone</a> website has gone live.  This website details the new Apple device designed to be your phone, your music player, your camera, your life...<br /><br />The tech specs are:<ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Screen size</span> - 3.5 inches</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Screen resolution</span> - 320 by 480 at 160 ppi</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Input method</span> - Multi-touch</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Operating system</span> - OS X</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Storage</span> - 4GB or 8GB</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">GSM</span> - Quad-band (MHz: 850, 900, 1800, 1900)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wireless data</span> - Wi-Fi (802.11b/g) + EDGE + Bluetooth 2.0</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Camera</span> - 2.0 megapixels</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Battery</span>  </li><ul><li>Up to 5 hours Talk / Video / Browsing</li></ul><ul><li>Up to 16 hours Audio playback</li></ul></ul>The reason this device is not your average phone is it runs OS X.  There had been recent rumblings that Apple were going to have an embedded version of OS X and this is it.  It looks fantastic, I just hope it runs as well as it looks.  Being OS X you get Safari as your web browser, you can use desktop widgets, and it all looks great.  Hopefully this also means that developers can really go to town, with the benefit of Apple's APIs and also being able to do cross-platform development.  Hell, this version of OS X even still supports multitasking.<br /><br />The interface has a keyboard and "multi-touch" the touchscreen user interface that is supposed to be really quite impressive.<br /><br />Enough drooling for today I think.</div>
