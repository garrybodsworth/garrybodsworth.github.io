Nope, I haven't forgot how to type, but it is a new Java Library for game development.  It provides access to <a href="http://www.openal.org">OpenAL</a> and <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> through Java.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lwjgl.org/">LWJGL</a> is designed to allow commercial quality game development in Java and represents many years of development.  It's not a game engine in itself but provides the framework to develop them easily on Java.  It is designed to work on anything with a JVM so it could be used in smartphones and the like.<br /><br />It's interesting from the point of view that this would enable cross-platform development and hopefully give a platform like DirectX.</div>
