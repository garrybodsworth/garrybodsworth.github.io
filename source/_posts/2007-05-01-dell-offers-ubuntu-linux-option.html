Dell has <a href="http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid39_gci1253364,00.html">officially announced</a> they will be making Linux based computers.<br /><br />Dell are going to offer certain computers with the option of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) as the pre-installed OS.  This is a good thing because it will at least guarantee the hardware and support of those platforms will be well catered for in the Linux environment.<br /><br />All in all this is a good thing, and I hope it spurs other computer makers into the same area.</div>
