This evening I attended a [Cory Doctorow][1] talk in Cambridge hosted by [Cambridge Business Lectures][1]. The lecture being about:

> **Cory Doctorow on Life in the Information Economy**
> 
> We made a bet, some decades ago, that the information economy would be based on buying and selling (and hence restricting copying of) information. We were totally, 100 percent wrong, and now the worldâ€™s in turmoil because of it. What does a copy-native economy look like? How do everyone from barbers to musicians become richer, more fulfilled and more civilly engaged in a real information society. And what do we do about the fact that a couple of dinosauric entertainment companies are determined to screw it up?

> Cory Doctorow is a blogger, science fiction writer and journalist. He is an editor of Boing Boing, the 11th best blog in the world (according to Time Magazine). He was the 2006-2007 Canadian Fulbright Chair in Public Diplomacy at the USC Center on Public Diplomacy. He founded the software company Opencola which was later sold to the Open Text Corporation. He also writes regularly for The Guardian newspaper 

All I can say is &#8220;Wow&#8221;. I&#8217;ve never heard anyone speak so fast for so long with so much content. In an hour he covered DRM, three strikes and your out, criminalisation of the customer, and much more. He concentrated also on the strengths of the Internet and not fighting against them one of which being the ability to form strong groups.

The best part is that he offers solutions not just problems, even his own content he generates, blogs, lectures, books, graphic novels, is available under Creative Commons. In the question and answers session he provide excellent answers, especially about software developers in this brave new world.

There was so much content that I think it is going to take a few days for my brain to process it all&#8230;

I&#8217;m pretty sure there will be a video or audio file available online soon so I will update this post with that link then. In the meantime here is a [link to his graphic novel][2] featuring adaptations of his short stories available for free.
