No, I haven't lost all typing skills, it is really called qooxdoo.<br /><br /><a href="http://qooxdoo.org/">qooxdoo</a> (see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qooxdoo">Wikipedia</a>) is an AJAX targetted Javascript user interface toolkit.  It is surprisingly fully featured and shows how far along web-based toolkits have come.  Well, when I say surprising, I mean shocking.<br /><br />The toolkit is LGPL licensed and has a large set of widgets available.  I think the best way to describe it is to send you to the demo page <a href="http://qooxdoo.org/demo">here</a> and I would recommend you look at <a href="http://demo.qooxdoo.org/html/at-a-glance/index.html">this example</a> in particular.  There is no point in looking at the screenshots as playing round with the demos demonstrates its depth of features and how polished they are.<br /><br />The advantages of this kit for web development include the abstraction away of web browser specifics and automatic browser detection.  It has things that are normally only seen in fully fledged desktop environments like drag-n-drop support.  Like I said earlier though I think the demos speak for themselves.</div>

No probs Si.  I found the whole thing astonishing when I found it, then I rebuilt my computer and forgot about it completely until a bit of paper just saying qooxdoo turned up by the computer today ;)<br /><br />If it was possible to make a web browser with no frame and a transparent window it would look pretty integrated with the system (not perfect for XP though at the moment).</div>
