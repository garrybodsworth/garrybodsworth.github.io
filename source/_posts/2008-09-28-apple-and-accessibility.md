[AppleInsider][1] have put up a very interseting article about iTunes and accessibility:  
[Apple makes iTunes 8, iTunes U content accessible to the blind][2]

> Apple has volunteered to work with the state of Massachusetts to make iTunes 8 and the new iPod nano fully accessible, unlocking music, movies, and the free lectures and other educational material in iTunes U to blind users. 

This is fantastic news as accessibility online is extremely important, especially as there is a move away from physical products in certain industries. With the iPod Nano 4G they have added more options with large fonts access and a spoken interface. Pairing that up with a more accessible iTunes will make it the best digital delivery platform for the visually impaired, especially since most other fully targeted solutions look like hell and are normally a few generations of technology behind.
