Microsoft have announced Visual Studio 2008 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/nov07/11-05TechEdDevelopersPR.mspx">will be released at the end of November 2007</a>.  It was announced as part of <a href="http://www.mseventseurope.com/teched/07/developers/content/Pages/Default.aspx">Microsoft TechEd Europe</a> in Spain.<br /><br />A lot of the details about MFC and native development are still shrouded in mystery.  Some of this I have outlined <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/10/gui-toolkits-mfc-v9-visual-studio-2008.html">in a previous post</a>.  Hopefully in the next few days some more information will become public.</div>
