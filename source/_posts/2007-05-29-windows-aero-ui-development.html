There is a new article on the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com">CodeProject</a> about retrofitting Windows Aero UI elements to existing applications.  <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/vista/AeroGlassLegacyWindowsApp.asp">Adding or Retrofitting Aero Glass into Legacy Windows Applications - Stefan Kuhr</a>.<br /><br />It's quite a comprehensive article and means someone else has done the research legwork for you - one of the beauties of the CodeProject.  This is especially useful as the Aero C++ headers have no real documentation as yet.</div>
