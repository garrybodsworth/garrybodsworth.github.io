Well, I now have Vista installed after swapping computers.  Something catastrophic happened with my own computer's motherboard whilst installing Vista.  After a day trying to get the computer to play ball a new BIOS was installed and Vista could also work properly on that computer.<br /><br />So - a word of warning for installing Vista - <span style="font-weight:bold;">upgrade your BIOS beforehand</span>.  I have no idea why the BIOS is incompatible as the computer is only 18 months old, but at least it now works, and I hope this post stops people heading down the same blind alley.<br /><br />The boot process is definitely taking much longer than Windows XP.  Installing most software is also mostly successful.  The ubiquitous <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a> works seamlessly.</div>
