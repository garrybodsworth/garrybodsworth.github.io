Just made my order for the [Humble Indie Games Pack][1]. This is a set of indie games that are up for sale at any price you want to pay with your choice as to how much goes to charity and how much goes to the developers. It looks like they have raised a lot of money for good causes (indie game developers deserve it was well).

All the games work on Windows, Mac and Linux (woohoo!) They are all DRM free and you can install them and run them how you want. The games are [World Of Goo][2], [Gish][3], [Aquaria][4], [Lugaru][5], and [Penumbra][6].

Time to go and install them on the wife&#8217;s Linux netbook &#8211; after all you always need more games on Linux.
