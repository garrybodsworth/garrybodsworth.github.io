Ah, Intellisense, the bane of all C++ developers.  I can't tell you how many times my Visual Studio has crawled into a hole and refused to get out or how many times the ncb has been corrupted by some arcane behaviour.<br /><br />But rather than waiting for Visual Studio 2008 for some improvements the Visual Studio team have been good enough to release an interim patch.  You can read about it <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2007/11/12/performance-improvements-in-visual-c.aspx">here</a>.<br /><br />Hopefully this will make some developer's lives easier.  You can download the patch from <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/Downloads/DownloadDetails.aspx?DownloadID=9436">this link</a>.</div>
