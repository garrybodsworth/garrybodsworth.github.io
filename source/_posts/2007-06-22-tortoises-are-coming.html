<a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/"></a>Before I start I just want to say thanks to all the people leaving comments.  This post actually comes out of what Frabcus has left in the comments about distributed revision control.<br /><br />I've been having a serious look into all the distributed revision control systems out there (well, the free ones at least) not only to understand the concepts of them but to see how easy they would be to use since they tend to lack the UI tools.<br /><br />Interestingly Mark Shuttleworth, Ubuntu founder has been discussing distributed revision control on his blog.  There are four posts <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/123">here</a>, <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/124">here</a>, <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/125">here</a> and <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/126">here</a>.<br /><br />But now to the subject of this post, the Tortoises.  First there was <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/">TortoiseCVS</a> which interestingly was started by an ex-NC Graphics employee <a href="http://www.flourish.org/">Francis Irving</a>.  Then there is obviously <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a>.<br /><br />So for these new distributed systems it looks like they are racing for Tortoise type implementations of user interfaces on Windows which would help to attract Windows developers.<br /><br />There is <a href="http://tortoisedarcs.sourceforge.net/">TortoiseDarcs</a> for <a href="http://darcs.net">Darcs</a>.  This is the most complete implementation for the distributed systems so far.  There are some good <a href="http://tortoisedarcs.sourceforge.net/screenshots/screenshots.html">screenshots</a> on the TortoiseDarcs website.<br /><br />For <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> (run by Canonical of Ubuntu fame and what Mark Shuttleworth was talking about on his blog) there is <a href="http://www.hl.id.au/Projects/tortoisebzr/">TortoiseBzr</a>.  It is using TortoiseCVS as a base to expand from.  There is also a placeholder on the wiki for Visual Studio integration.<br /><br />For <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a> there was an announcement on their mailing list that someone has started on <a href="http://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2007-April/012923.html">Tortoise-hg</a> and they ave a small set of functionality.  It hasn't been publicly released yet, but hopefully soon.<br /><br />There is no TortoiseGit being looked at, but I think the Windows support requires work before that step is taken I suppose.</div>

I don't know what frabcus is talking about.  I made a test repository and tested directory merges, and it seems to work fine.  Are you using "git mv" to perform the directory renames?  If not, that's your problem.</div>

The thing is I think Git is perfect for Linus,but tat does not make it necessarily so for general use.  Watching teh presentation that Linus gave at Google it seems the merge problems are able to be the patch submitter's problem rather than the maintaner's, so the miantainer only ever does simple merging.<BR/><BR/>Garry</div>

Thanks for the link to Mark Shuttleworths blog. <BR/><BR/>I'm a bit stunned that Git can't properly handle merging directory renames! Everyone until now has claimed that Git's merge support was perfect - it seems like a major defect to me.<BR/><BR/>So that, combined with not being a proper library that is portable to other operating systems, sadly rules out Git.</div>
