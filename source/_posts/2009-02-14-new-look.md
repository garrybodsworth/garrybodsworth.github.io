I decided it was time for a new look so I grabbed the [iNove][1] theme for WordPress. I&#8217;ve made a few minor hacks for it which I will publish in due course (although I&#8217;ve got no idea what license these themes are available under. The changes I&#8217;ve made are the code tag now using different formatting, different font for the title, and making the hover on the subscribe link show the number of subscribers on Feedburner.

The website for the guy that supplied this theme is [here][2].

I&#8217;ve also now installed [WP-Codebox][3] to make posting code much easier and configurable.
