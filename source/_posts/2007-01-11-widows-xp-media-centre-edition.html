I've now finally got around to installing Windows MCE on my media centre after fooling around with <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/">Media Portal</a> as my media centre software.<br /><br />My media centre is based on a cheap AOpen XC-Cube with a cheapo Sempron 2600+.  Amazingly it works pretty well the only problem being the transition animations are not too smooth occasionally when running at the highest possible resolution (1280x1024x32bpp).<br /><br />I've been quite impressed with the software.  It is much smoother to set up then the open-source ones I have used in the past, but I don't particularly want to use something because it is the path of least resistance.<br /><br />In general the smooth set up and the smooth operation has been better than I expected.  It now works much better with the MCE infra-red keyboard and control, the stand-by operation is much smoother and wake-up ability much better.  Maybe the drivers installed for MCE since it does not necessarily use the same drivers as XP Home/Pro make it more stable?<br /><br />Still after installing it you have to download one round of updates, then 78 updates, then another 13 (at least).  That takes ages - yawn.<br /><br />I'm actually quite impressed by the associated operating system - it is XP with a lick of paint and extra features.  I have no idea why Microsoft didn't use it as an opportunity to release a new version of the OS at the consumer level since MCE is only really for manufacturers.  All manufacturers seem to be using MCE ahead of XP Home anyway now.<br /><br />Overall it has been a very good experience and my wife is finding it easy to use, that is always a good yardstick.</div>
