[Fantastic Plastic: 20 Essential Works of LEGO Art][1]  
LEGO art is simply brilliant! I love the Escher piece.

[Browse the Artifacts of Geek History in Jay Walker&#8217;s Library][2]  
This has some serious nerd cool. And some lucky people get to see it by invitation.

[Blue Screen of Death in unexpected locations][3]  
It&#8217;s amazing some of these have happened. At least at [Camvine][4] we won&#8217;t see any, unless we design a webpage to look like it.

[Lua in Lightroom][5]  
Adobe Lightroom is very interesting. The core is written in C++ (thanks to some of the work done by the Adobe Software Technology Labs) and the program logic is written in Lua. I seem to remember some mention of this at the [Sean Parent talks][6] at this year&#8217;s [ACCU][7] conference. It&#8217;s a great use of mixing languages.

[A 20-year game of Telephone][8]  
A look at the claims of the industry about the effects of IP infringement.

[RDESTL][9]  
An interesting STL influenced library.

[13 Great Free Backup Programs for Windows, Mac, and Linux][10]  
Because backing up is good.

[10 Most Beautiful Looking Linux Desktop][11]  
[10 Finger Licking Linux Desktop Themes][12]  
Does exactly what it says on the title.

[First Atom-based nano-ITX board?][13]  
Soon we will have Atoms on the head of the pin&#8230;.
