Here in the UK we had an episode of The Money Programme broadcast on the BBC called <a href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/b00c6sdc.shtml">Bill Gates: How a Geek Changed the World</a>.  Follow the link to see it on the iPlayer.<br /><br />An interesting part of this is <span style="font-style:italic;">Steve Wozniak: How it began</span> which is highlighted and can be watched on the BBC News site <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7464704.stm">here</a>.  It's certainly nice to think of a time when the computer business wasn't all about taking over the world.  It's a brief video from how he got involved in computers, through starting Apple.<br /><br />It's nice to see some programmes on TV that look at computing, in fact I'm amazed at the lack of ones about the history of computing.  Although we may be getting a dramatisation featuring <a href="http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/06/leo-dicaprio-at.html">Leonardo DiCaprio as a co-founder of Atari</a>...</div>
