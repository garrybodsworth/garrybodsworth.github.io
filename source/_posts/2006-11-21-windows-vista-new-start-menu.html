<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a> has a little post about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/21.html">"Choices = Headaches"</a> about UI design.<br /><br />It looks at the start menu and the number of choices to shut down a computer.  I personally was even more concerned about the bad design presenting it to the user (and to a lesser degree there were far too many options), in fact XP did it better.  I realise that there are lots of options, but initially I missed where <span style="font-style:italic;">Restart</span> was.<br /><br />Simply cutting down the number of options is not enough I feel, someone should have sat down and actually used the design that they have foisted on the user.</div>
