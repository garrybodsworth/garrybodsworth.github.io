On my Internet travels I walk randomly through following links until I find something interesting.  That is what I have done:<br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/11/10/the-office-2007-ui-bible.aspx">The Office 2007 UI Bible</a><br /><br />This is a series of many blog posts that look into the reasoning behind the new Office 2007 UI.  It covers the history of office GUIs, the new design, and how to extend that design.  There are lots of interesting points but it will take a long while to get through!</div>
