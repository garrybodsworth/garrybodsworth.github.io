At [Camvine][1] where we liberate your content from the tyranny of computers to let you splat it onto screens for all to see, we have a few openings. We&#8217;ve got the [codapod][2] end of the delivery which is the hardware that pumps out the pixels to your screen, right the way through to the [web service][3] which controls the screens and the content.

We are looking for two people, a [software developer][4] and a [customer liaison/support/QA][5].

I can vouch that the software development side is fun and challenging. There is a lot of scope for doing exciting things and coming up with new and clever solutions.

If you&#8217;re interested or know someone else who is interested then get in contact at the addresses in the ads.
