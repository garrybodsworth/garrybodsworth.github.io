A couple of interesting articles about programming:<br />* <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2007/asshole-driven-development/">What kind of development do you participate in?</a><br />* <a href="http://www.chrylers.com/top-ten-of-programming-advice-to-not-follow">Top Ten Programming Advice Not To Follow</a>.<br /><br />All this makes me realise I haven't done any top tens - I'll have to rectify that as I feel left out.<br /><br />Next up I am planning some a post about <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a>.</div>
