Part of the reason blogging has been so light in recent months is that work has been taking up more time than usual.  Now at least it is official.<br /><br />The company I work for, <a href="http://www.ncgraphics.net">NC Graphics</a> has been acquired by <a href="http://www.ptc.com">PTC (Parametric Technology Corporation)</a>.  You can see the press release <a href="http://www.ptc.com/appserver/wcms/standards/textsub.jsp?&im_dbkey=51168&icg_dbkey=21">here</a> and some additional information is available <a href="http://www.ptc.com/company/ncgraphics/index.htm">here</a>.<br /><br />Obviously it is all only of interest if you know me, but at least it will explain what I am doing when I change my blog summary.  Fingers crossed it will be a good move.  This has all been very tightly kept under wraps so it probably surprises quite a few people.  It has been surprising that noone in this entire period has asked me about it since CAM really is quite a small industry.<br /><br />And on a related note - Julian Todd and Martin Dunschen are ex-NC Graphics employees with a CAM blog linked to on the side panel to your right.</div>
