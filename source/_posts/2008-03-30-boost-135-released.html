A new version of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost Library</a> for C++ has been released.  Version 1.35 adds 12 new libraries as well as the usual improvements and bugfixes.  Also there is a new look website which is a nice looking refinement with better access to the documentation.  Boost is a great addition to any C++ developer's armament.<br /><br />I think this is also the first release using all their new tools and processes (Subversion, Trac, website and other stuff) so I think it is possible that future releases will be more frequent with this framework in place, because I think the plan was originally to have a release twice a year.  That might mean there is a possibility of the logging library by <a href="http://www.torjo.com">John Torjo</a> being integrated soon as well as some others.<br /><br />Some of the work brings the current libraries in line with the new C++ TR1 library standard - mainly to do with threads.<br /><br />The new libraries are:<br /><h3><span class="link"></span></h3><ul><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/asio/index.html">Asio</a>:</span> Portable networking,         including sockets, timers, hostname resolution and socket iostreams, from         Chris Kohlhoff.       </li><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/bimap/index.html">Bimap</a>:</span> Boost.Bimap is a         bidirectional maps library for C++.

There is a CMake build system available but not "official".<BR/><BR/>http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/CMakeConfigAndBuild<BR/><BR/>That might be a bit better.</div>

Boost 1.35 appears to be a big step (especially the networking module), but I cannot not get it to compile universal libraries or static libraries yet. Disappointing to say the least. I wish they used a less opaque build system so I could figure out how to hack it and make it work.</div>
