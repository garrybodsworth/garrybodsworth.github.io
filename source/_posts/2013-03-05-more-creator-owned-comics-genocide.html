Before I gave up drawing around 17/18 (nearly 18 years ago) I was working on a strip that I was hoping to be published in a new Lee Davies (he of the old UK fanzine Mondo) publication. &nbsp;So I came up with a whole series bible and a set of comic strips in this universe. &nbsp;Unfortunately part of the reason for giving up on comics was the publication never started and&nbsp;I didn't think I was good enough (looking back I was a little harsh on myself).<br /><br />I had all these pages gathering dust for nearly 20 years(!) &nbsp;Noone else has seen them apart from me when I was drawing them. &nbsp;Apart from Transformers fanzines I seem to have not successsfully managed to publish any comics, so I have loads of strips in varying states of completedness. &nbsp;Please bear in mind this was done in 1995-ish so such wonders of computers I was using but manually pasting up because it was another year before I had a suitable DTP package.<br /><br />For <a href="http://www.stephendowneygallery.com/2013/02/creator-owned-day-2013.html">Creator Owned Day</a> I've decided to scan them in. &nbsp;Without further ado is <b>Genocide: Duostar</b> unleashed on an unsuspecting world!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garrybodsworth/8531823504/" title="Genocide: Duostar Page 01 by Garry Bodsworth, on Flickr"><img alt="Genocide: Duostar Page 01"

that I completely re-wrote and re-drew when I wasn't happy with it and after getting a script critique. &nbsp;This is a lot splashier and influenced by US comics, but the version above was much tighter and more 2000AD which is far closer to my sensibilities.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garrybodsworth/8530702613/" title="Early Duostar Comic Strip Page 01 by Garry
