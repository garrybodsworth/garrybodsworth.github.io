My dad gave me a Linksys Wireless router (WRT54G) and it looks ug-leeee, so I never used it and bought a more stylish looking one which turned out not to work properly to the point I got so annoyed I threw it away.<br /><br />So I dug out the WRT54G and plugged it in.  It worked flawlessly until today when my two router network decided to eat itself.  Eventually after much resetting I got it all up and running again, but I discovered that with heavy network traffic like P2P (and probably my surfing habits) it can crash due to keeping a record of everything for five days.<br /><br />A quick websearch lead me to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRT54G">Wikipedia Article on the Linksys WRT54G</a> and reading that I realised exactly what I had.  The company had opened up the firmware and there were a variety of open source versions available.  I then read this <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/faq.php#Special_note_for_users_with_Linksys_WRT54G_GL_GS_routers">FAQ for utorrent</a> where it describes what firmware it recommends and how to avoid overloading the router.  Never being afraid of destroying hardware I installed <a href="http://www.thibor.co.uk/">HyperWRT Thibor</a> on the router (there is a decent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperWRT">Wikipedia page for HyperWRT</a> as well).  Once it rebooted I saw how many extra features are in there now.  Needless to say I am buying only Linksys routers from now on...</div>
