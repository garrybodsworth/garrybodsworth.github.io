It has been a while since I have said anything about upcoming talks in Cambridge.

[The original Apprentice is coming to town &#8211; Cambridge Business Lectures][1]  
**10th November 2008 5.30pm**

> Tim Campbell, the winner of the first series of The Apprentice, is coming to Cambridge. Tim will talking on “Much sugar is a good thing: the power of mentoring”.
> 
> Tim stands out from other Apprentice contestants &#8211; and winners &#8211; as being a man of substance and depth as well as charisma. Since leaving Amstrad, he’s set up two ventures. Most recently, his Bright Ideas Trust gives advice and funding to young people to help them get their ideas off the ground.
> 
> Tim will be talking at Robinson College, Cambridge at 5:30pm on Monday November 10th. The event is free, but you need to [book a place][2].

I&#8217;m really interested to see what life after what essentially amounts to a &#8220;reaity&#8221; TV programme is like, because it sounds like he has accomplished some really good things. Unfortunately his era at Amstrad was recent so I guess no questions about the CPC464&#8230;
