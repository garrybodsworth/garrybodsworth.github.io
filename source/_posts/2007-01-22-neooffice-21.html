In the <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/01/mac-osx.html">previous post</a> I mentioned <a href="http://www.neooffice.org">NeoOffice</a> - the Mac-based version of <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a>.<br /><br />In the first quarter 2007 there are plans to release version 2.1.  This is going to integrate the changes from OpenOffice 2.0->2.1, which includes new scripting and lots of improvements.  Not only that it will also have support for Office 2007 documents, and execution of VBA scripts in Excel documents.<br /><br />Overall it looks like NeoOffice is pressing ahead with substantial improvements and features.  It's good to see that Mac OSX has an accomplished office suite outside of Office for Mac.</div>

I believe <a href="http://openoffice.screencast-tutorials.com/index">Plan-B for OpenOffice.org should be helpful for NeoOffice users</a> as well. <a hef="http://openoffice.screencast-tutorials.com/auth/register">Register and try it out</a> and let me know.</div>
