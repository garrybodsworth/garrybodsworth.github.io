At the beginning of this year I started my new role at a stealth start-up called Bromium.&nbsp; What can be said about it is we are building a next generation virtualisation product for security.&nbsp; The exciting thing is that we are now only four days away from the public announcement about what we have been working on.&nbsp; This will be at the at the GigaOM Structure conference in San Francisco where our CTO <a href="http://event.gigaom.com/structure/speakers/#simon_crosby">Simon Crosby</a> will be doing a talk called "Secure Everything" (<a href="http://event.gigaom.com/structure/schedule/">schedule here</a>).<br /><br />It's been an interesting and hectic time here at Bromium.&nbsp; Lots of good news in the past month.&nbsp; We should be in a new office by the end of this month with lots more space.&nbsp; A new <a href="http://mynameismwd.org/index.php?id=872">Director Of OS X Products</a> going to start soon in the Cambridge office, which now means two-thirds of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/naughton/2515581935/in/photostream">Shed dwellers from Camvine</a> have ended up at Bromium.&nbsp; We also have several new people starting over the next month, which is great news because they are all extremely talented.<br /><br />I've spent a lot of time over the past few months doing job fairs and interviews as we try to build a strong Cambridge team.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.siliconmilkroundcambridge.com/">Silicon Milkround in Cambridge</a> was not as successful as we would have hoped, but we got a few interesting things out of it.&nbsp; The <a href="http://siliconmilkroundabout.com/">Silicon Milkround</a> in London was a roaring success with some crazy amount of CVs and contacts (I think the figure was 40-50) and if you were there you might have seen me do a two minute pitch for the company.&nbsp; These events I swear were some of the hardest work I've ever done, but really fun and satisfying, I can guarantee I slept well afterwards.&nbsp; We spent a lot of time sorting through all, this has meant I've done about 20 interviews over the past month which is a good way to fry your brain.<br /><br />At Bromium it feels like we can't use the term brogrammers which has been co-opted by others.&nbsp; And to prove that I am not I got minus 165 on <a href="http://areyouabrogrammer.com/">Are You A Brogrammer?</a><br /><br />If you are a developer, test engineer, or an OS X developer and fancy the challenge of your career drop me a line or mail <a href="mailto:jobs.uk@bromium.com">jobs.uk@bromium.com</a> - we are still <a href="http://www.bromium.com/careers.html">hiring</a>.<br /><br />After the 20th June it will be an exciting prospect to actually tell people what I've been working on!</div>
