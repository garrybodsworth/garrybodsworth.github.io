Since going back to standard XP Pro I thought is there a way of making it look a bit more modern.  I didn't fancy messing round with the theming DLLs and using what essentially amount to substandard themes.<br /><br />I thought how about getting the MCE2005 UI on Windows XP Pro (not a recreation of it but the actual one).  A few minutes Googling gave me my answer, Microsoft New Zealand had accidentally released the Royale theme, unfortunately they pulled it soon after.  Luckily this being the Internet the cat can never go back in the bag.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-Enhancements/Themes/Royale-Theme-for-WinXP.shtml">MCE2005 Royale theme</a> for Windows XP is available at the link.  You just need to run the installer and it puts it in the right place.<br /><br />For those that like things a bit darker there is a Royale Noir theme leaked from Microsoft that did not make the cut into MCE2005.  You can download the files <a href="http://plaza.ufl.edu/psrivats/Luna2.rar">here</a>.  You need to install this after the Royale theme.  Extract it to c:\WINDOWS\Resource\Luna Noir.  Then double-click on the luna.msstyles file, this will then give another sub-option to Royale on the Appearance tab in display settings.</div>

Finally today I snapped.<br /><br />No more Vista for me I am going back to Windows XP and hopefully a working life of sanity.  I had been at work for two hours and accomplished nothing but fighting with Windows Vista for uninstalling, installing, and rebooting.  Even then I didn't manage to finish what I was trying to do.<br /><br />So then I snapped.  I decided to go back to Windows XP.  No more deathly slow animations or silent marches of death through the UAC for me.  I have no idea if Vista is a good consumer OS, but it is awful for developers who have to constantly install, reboot, update, use large amounts of files, do incremental building, and other such things.<br /><br />I can't see a service pack rectifying the problem, maybe in three years it will be usable if the XP lifecycle is anything to go by.<br /><br />It was noticeable working on Vista then coming home to XP simply how much faster XP is.  It is not anything to do with slowness drawing to the screen or the length of animations.  It all comes down to things like context menus, and security running in the background that makes simple tasks like starting a program or switching applications into a waiting game.  Nothing ever "locks up" as something is always moving and interactive, but it rarely lets you do a series of quickfire operations or run multiple IDEs without groaning.  Don't even get me started on rebooting breaking C++ precompiled headers.<br /><br />Well, this three month hell is over...</div>

I had to make sure the application I work on runs well on Vista.  It was the best way to ensure this.<BR/><BR/>Unfortunately I paid the price with my own sanity.  People are already commenting I am much more relaxed running XP ;)</div>

Three months? I'm impressed.<BR/>I lasted four or five days before I gave up and went back to XP...<BR/>It's interesting to see I'm not alone though... ;)</div>

I started by downloading the Windows SDK, which had a file extension <span style="font-style:italic;">.img</span>.  After a bit of <a href="http://www.google.com">Googling</a> I found out you can just change the extension to <span style="font-style:italic;">.iso</span>.<br /><br />Now it was time to burn it.  I found out that the ISO Burning Powertoy doesn't work for DVDs.  The software with the DVD drive was so hatefully bad that it was unusable.<br /><br />So I searched out the burning engine from DVDDecrypter which has been split off by the developer after all the raids and legal ranglings.  Now it is called <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/">ImgBurn</a> and it was a case of choosing the ISO then hitting the big button to burn.  Oh, did I mention it was freeware as well?  Top notch stuff.</div>

In my last company I redesigned every icon in the system from a 16 colour pallette into full 32-bit alpha-blended glory.  I also wrote the support functions for cool looking disabled and hover (hot) looks.<br /><br />In total I think that was 250-300 icons.  Probably more.  I didn't follow any guidelines apart from my own consistency of design.  To be honest the Microsoft Guidelines were very difficult to follow if you wanted to produce a substantial number of toolbar and tree view icons.<br /><br />There are a few guidelines out there now:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwxp/html/winxpicons.asp">Windows XP Icon Guidelines</a></li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/UxGuide/UXGuide/Resources/WhatsNewInVista/Aero.asp">Windows Vista Icon Guidelines</a> - still not implemented.</li><li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGIcons/chapter_14_section_2.html">Apple OS X Icon Guidelines</a></li></ul><br /><br />The reason I am writing this today is that Apple have recently added a style guide for their icons, and it is part of their <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGIntro/chapter_1_section_1.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000894-TP6">Apple Human Interface Guidelines</a> which is essentially an online book and is very in-depth.<br /><br />I find it interesting that OS makers can chastise the applications for not being consistent and so on, but without providing developers with the information and tools to go and do it, they surely can't be surprised...  Hell, you can't even edit 32-bit icons in Visual Studio or even through an add-on.</div>
