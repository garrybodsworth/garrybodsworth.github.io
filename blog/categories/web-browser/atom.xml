Argh!  The web has been down at work for over 24 hours.  I now realise it is 100% essential for my job.  Google has replaced a certain portion of my brain....  I can't answer any questions without it (okay, a slight exaggeration).<br /><br />One tool I have now found indispensable now is <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>.  Up until recently I have used the Google Browser Sync for using my bookmarks at multiple locations.  The problem I found is I am very selective about what I bookmark as current bookmarking UIs available in IE and FireFox do not scale very well.  Then I get in the situation I haven' bookmarked something and I spend ages on Google tryin to find it again.<br /><br />I decided to move to del.ico.us as there was a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615">new tool for Firefox</a> which replaces the bookmarking system in Firefox, so now I use it exclusively tagging webpages at will.  Obviously the number of bookmarks I have is increasing rapidly especially since I can even tag individual articles.<br /><br />As you can see on the sidebar you can see what I am currently bookmarking and what I have bookmarked.  I have also added the ability to bookmark individual articles quickly if you want.  I tend to find most web technologies a bit hollow (MySpace Facebook and the suchlike) but this is a tool that reallyhelps make the web a better place, and all users of the system are sharing what they know with their bookmarks.</div>

I realised the other day how many Google products I was using...<ul><li>Analytics</li><li>Blogger</li><li>Browser Sync</li><li>Calendar</li><li>Google</li><li>Mail</li><li>Notebook</li><li>Page Creator</li><li>Personalized Homepage</li></ul>Also I use the search and now the code search.<br /><br />And now I have just signed up for:<ul><li>Spreadsheets</li><li>Writely</li></ul>It's great all these things are free and freely provided, but now I think I am getting too reliant on it all...  Admittedly I only use some of the things I am signed up to, and signed up to other things just to try them out.<br /><br />But I wasn't going to discuss my addiction to trying things out.  Something occurred to me when I was looking at the new <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Office</a>, browsers are providing all this functionality, but we are still using an ancient paradigm.<br /><br />Microsoft are releasing Internet Explorer 7.0 very soon, and it is attempting to catch up with Firefox by adding features like tabbed browsing, but it is just playing catch-up to an idea that was born before all of the AJAX applications started leaping out of the woodwork.<br /><br />As these AJAX applications become more prevalent the web browser starts to become a hindrance.  Do you use multiple tabs or do you use multiple windows, and how do you arrange and manage those windows (especially since they all have the same taskbar icon)?  Are the bookmark user interfaces moving with the times?  The web browser needs a rethink for these new uses as it is still designed more for viewing static data (and now that is only part of its repetoire, a specialisation of its more generalised use).<br /><br />Most web browsers have their rendering engine a different layer, so that is easy to break out.  Do these applications become a separate window?  Do we get a new kind of application launcher?  I've never really put much thought into it as until recently I never saw the web as a platform.<br /><br />Certainly I am finding the current browser technology very limiting as tabbed browsing, multiple windows, bookmarks are not allowing me to use all of these new applications to their maximum potential.  Just having GMail and Blogger open in web browsers is harder than it should be to manage as I have to do a double take on the task bar or think before switching tabs.<br /><br />Maybe the web browser needs a rethink, or maybe my ideas aren't so outlandish...  The main web browser application is some sort of navigator/task bar and the pages are shown in their own easily recognisable windows, perhaps even without borders as they currently exist.  I suppose some of these ideas are being integrated into these new "sidebars" in operating systems, but do they go far enough and take the new AJAX applications into account?</div>
