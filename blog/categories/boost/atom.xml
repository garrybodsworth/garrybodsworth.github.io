    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
A new version of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost Library</a> for C++ has been released.  Version 1.35 adds 12 new libraries as well as the usual improvements and bugfixes.  Also there is a new look website which is a nice looking refinement with better access to the documentation.  Boost is a great addition to any C++ developer's armament.<br /><br />I think this is also the first release using all their new tools and processes (Subversion, Trac, website and other stuff) so I think it is possible that future releases will be more frequent with this framework in place, because I think the plan was originally to have a release twice a year.  That might mean there is a possibility of the logging library by <a href="http://www.torjo.com">John Torjo</a> being integrated soon as well as some others.<br /><br />Some of the work brings the current libraries in line with the new C++ TR1 library standard - mainly to do with threads.<br /><br />The new libraries are:<br /><h3><span class="link"></span></h3><ul><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/asio/index.html">Asio</a>:</span> Portable networking,         including sockets, timers, hostname resolution and socket iostreams, from         Chris Kohlhoff.       </li><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/bimap/index.html">Bimap</a>:</span> Boost.Bimap is a         bidirectional maps library for C++. With Boost.Bimap you can create associative         containers in which both types can be used as key, from Matias Capeletto.       </li><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/circular_buffer/index.html">Circular Buffer</a>:</span> STL         compliant container also known as ring or cyclic buffer, from Jan Gaspar.       </li><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/function_types/index.html">Function Types</a>:</span>    Boost.FunctionTypes         provides functionality to classify, decompose and synthesize function, function         pointer, function reference and pointer to member types. From Tobias Schwinger.       </li><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/fusion/index.html">Fusion</a>:</span>    Library for working         with tuples, including various containers, algorithms, etc. From Joel de         Guzman, Dan Marsden and Tobias Schwinger.       </li><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/gil/doc/index.html">GIL</a>:</span>    Generic Image Library,         from Lubomir Bourdev and Hailin Jin.       </li><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/interprocess/index.html">Interprocess</a>:</span>    Shared         memory, memory mapped files, process-shared mutexes, condition variables,         containers and allocators, from Ion Gaztañaga.       </li><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/intrusive/index.html">Intrusive</a>:</span>    Intrusive         containers and algorithms, from Ion Gaztañaga.       </li><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/math/doc/sf_and_dist/html/index.html">Math/Special         Functions</a>:</span>    A wide selection of mathematical special functions from         John Maddock, Paul Bristow, Hubert Holin and Xiaogang Zhang.       </li><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/math/doc/sf_and_dist/html/index.html">Math/Statistical         Distributions</a>:</span>    A wide selection of univariate statistical distributions         and functions that operate on them from John Maddock and Paul Bristow       </li><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/doc/html/mpi.html">MPI</a>:</span>    Message Passing Interface         library, for use in distributed-memory parallel application programming,         from Douglas Gregor and Matthias Troyer.       </li><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/system/index.html">System</a>:</span>    Operating system         support, including the diagnostics support that will be part of the C++0x         standard library, from Beman Dawes.       </li></ul></div>

There is a CMake build system available but not "official".<BR/><BR/>http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/CMakeConfigAndBuild<BR/><BR/>That might be a bit better.</div>

Boost 1.35 appears to be a big step (especially the networking module), but I cannot not get it to compile universal libraries or static libraries yet. Disappointing to say the least. I wish they used a less opaque build system so I could figure out how to hack it and make it work.</div>

Back in May <a href="http://www.boostcon.com/home">Boostcon</a> took placein May this year.  I have posted previously about some of the already available talk slides (see the <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Papers_and_Presentations">Adobe ones here</a>).  See my previous post <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/05/boostcon-2007-presentations.html">here</a>.<br /><br />There are a couple of new articles <a href="http://www.artima.com/cppsource/boost_con_07.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.artima.com/cppsource/boost_con_07_up_close.html">here</a> that make interesting reading.  Also an attendee has some write ups <a href="http://blog.emptycrate.com/">here</a>.  Some more slides <a href="http://www.nabble.com/BoostCon-2007-Slides-t3849974.html">are also available</a>.  More write-ups <a href="http://jeffandhoa.com/blog/">here</a>.<br /><br />Fingers crossed one day I'll be able to attend something as interesting as this.</div>

<a href="http://www.boostcon.com/home">Boostcon 2007</a> (the conference about the splendid C++ library <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a>) happened on the 14th-18th May 2007.<br /><br />I've been keeping an eye out for any papers/presentations that will be made public from it.  Fingers crossed someone will sort out the general public with copies of all the presentations and notes.<br /><br />Good news though since on the <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com">Adobe ASL</a> Wiki, Sean Parent one of the dead clever guys at Adobe has posted his presentations.  One of which is the keynote address.<br /><br />The first one, the keynote, is about the possible future of software development - concentrating mainly on generic programming and how we can use it to reduce errors.  You can download it <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Image:Boostcon_possible_future.pdf">here</a>.<br /><br />The second is about the Boost Poly library.  You can download this <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Image:Boost_poly.pdf">here</a>.  This is also by Sean Parent.<br /><br />On a related note I will hopefully be doing some in-depth posts about the Adobe ASL soon as I am finding it very interesting going through the documentation.</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
The latest version of the <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> Library has been released.  This is version 1.34 and you can read the changes on the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost frontpage</a>.<br /><br />Boost is a fantastic peer reviewed library collection for C++.  It adds power and robustness for C++ programmers, after all we shouldn't need to reinvent the wheel all of the time.<br /><br />There are five new libraries:<br />     * Foreach Library:<br />         BOOST_FOREACH macro for easily iterating over the elements of a<br />         sequence, from Eric Niebler.<br />     * Statechart Library:<br />         Arbitrarily complex finite state machines can be implemented in<br />         easily readable and maintainable C++ code, from Andreas Huber.<br />     * TR1 Library:<br />         An implementation of the C++ Technical Report on Standard Library<br />         Extensions, from John Maddock.<br />         This library does not itself implement the TR1 components, rather<br />         it's a thin wrapper that will include your standard library's TR1<br />         implementation (if it has one), otherwise it will include the Boost<br />         Library equivalents, and import them into namespace std::tr1. Highlights<br />         include: Reference Wrappers, Smart Pointers, result_of,<br />         Function Object Binders, Polymorphic function wrappers, Type Traits,<br />         Random Number Generators and Distributions, Tuples, Fixed Size Array,<br />         Hash Function Objects, Regular Expressions and<br />         Complex Number Additional Algorithms.<br />     * Typeof Library:<br />         Typeof operator emulation, from Arkadiy Vertleyb and Peder Holt.<br />     * Xpressive Library:<br />         Regular expressions that can be written as strings or as expression<br />         templates, and that can refer to each other and themselves recursively<br />         with the power of context-free grammars, from Eric Niebler. <br /><br />Obviously lots of the other libraries have been updated like Boost::Python.</div>

    <updated>2007-04-26T22:16:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.fragmentedmemory.com/blog/2007/04/26/gui-toolkits-notus</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
This is a GUI toolkit that I had never heard of or seen until yesterday.<br /><br /><a href="http://notus.sourceforge.net/">Notus</a> is a GUI toolkit based on the ideas of generic C++ programming, according to the website it is an attempt to create a domain model.<br /><br />It hasn't been developed for a very long time now (over a year) according to the website but looking at the CVS logs there were changes six months ago to the source code.<br /><br />It is by no means a finished article but it has some interesting ideas (although it looks like it could e incredibly complicated thanks to lots of templates).  It is not as comprehensive as the other library that uses the same concepts <a href="http://www.torjo.com/win32gui/">Win32 GUI Generics</a>.<br /><br />The demos are quite simple and a few years out of date, but it seems to at least work.  It is a shame that none of the Boost-ified GUI libraries seem to have caught on, or at least been carried on.</div>
