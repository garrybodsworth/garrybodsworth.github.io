Finally, I am getting around to an update to the TortoiseSVN Visual Studio Integration.  The catalyst for this is the release of Visual Studio 2008 (formally codename Orcas) Beta 2, and making sure I can still play with Subversion through the IDE.<br /><br />I have made a new distribution ZIP file with a few more configurations inside.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/Subversion.zip">Download it here.</a></span><br /><br />It has a few more features than before including some for dealing with conflicts.  The distribution itself has a few more files so you can decide whether you want to just have the menus, toolbars or context menus.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1xvreyfQ6ns/Rq5I_talWbI/AAAAAAAAAAM/55l1sNrJM7o/s1600-h/Toolbar.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1xvreyfQ6ns/Rq5I_talWbI/AAAAAAAAAAM/55l1sNrJM7o/s320/Toolbar.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093088487962663346" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Supported operations</span><br /><br />The following Subversion/TortoiseSVN features are covered in the integration:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Commit</span> - Commit the files to the repository</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span> - Update the current working version</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">History</span> - Get the history for the selected file</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Diff</span> - Get the diff compared to the base version</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Blame</span> - Find out who committed the crimes in the file</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Revert</span> - Undo changes</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modifications</span> - Check to see if any files have been modified</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit Conflicts</span> - Edit the conflicts that arise from merging/updating</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Resolve</span> - Mark the file as resolved for conflicts</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Repository</span> - View the repository on the server</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Project History</span> - Get the history of the entire project</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Solution</span> - Add the solution being edited to source control</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Branch/Tag</span> - Perform a branch or tag operation on the current working copy</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Settings</span> - Set up TortoiseSVN</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">SubversionInstall.vbs</span><br /><br />This simply installs a set of External Tools into Visual Studio for common TortoiseSVN operations.  It can be installed on versions above Visual Studio.NET (version 7.0).  Currently it is configured for Visual Studio 2008 (version 9.0), to make it work on other versions change the variable "strVisualStudioVersionNumber" as outlined in the file's comments.<br /><br />Also, if you have installed TortoiseSVN in a non-default location, make sure that you change the variable "strTortoiseSVNBin" to the correct binary path.  Make sure that the backslashes are doubled up.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">SubversionMenu.vssettings</span><br /><br />This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.<br /><br />This adds a menu to the IDE for TortoiseSVN with the appropriate icons.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">SubversionMenuToolbar.vssettings</span><br /><br />This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.<br /><br />This adds a menu for TortoiseSVN as well as a toolbar using the appropriate icons.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">SubversionMenuToolbarContexts.vssettings</span><br /><br />This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.<br /><br />This adds not only the menu and toolbar, but also adds the items to the appropriate context menus for files and solutions.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">SubversionMenuToolbarContextsVS2005.vssettings</span><br /><br />This provides the menu, toolbar and context menus for TortoiseSVN in Visual Studio 2005.<br /><br />Unfortunately there is no good solution for file renaming (I always do it through Windows Explorer) since this integration uses the External tools and allows for it to work in Visual Studio Express.</div>

Hey<BR/> <A HREF="http://www.blogger.com/profile/06424543930869218613" REL="nofollow">Bluehorse</A> uninstall is not that difficult after removing all the registry you must set ToolNumKeys=2 you will find this in External tools only.<BR/><BR/>This means no need to remove registry entry just keep playing with the ToolNumKeys.<BR/><BR/>:)</div>

Hello, regarding uninstall, editing the registry is a pain and not simple in this case, I end up with 21 grayed out menu items 'External command' in Vs2008 in the Tools menu. Would be absolutely great if you could include an uninstall script.<BR/><BR/>Would also be nice if the svn commands could be grouped into a submenu.<BR/><BR/>Great approach anyway :)<BR/>2 cents</div>

Gary, thanks for your work. On start up, I still get the error,<BR/><BR/>"The project MyProject.vcproj appears to be under source control, but the associated source control plug-in is not installed on this computer. Source control will be disabled for this project."<BR/><BR/>Even though the toolbar seems to work. Can you help me understand why that might be? I installed the seetings for VS2005. Thanks!!</div>

Would you be able to write better installation steps? As you say what the files are but not how to actually install it. <BR/>What do I do with the .vbs? does it need to go into a project? Why not put it together more, even an exe would be better.<BR/><BR/>Cheers<BR/><BR/>Andrew</div>

Ok. this looks like a good alternative to VSS but am a little stuck...<BR/>Am setting up a LAN environment, the TortoiseSVN in on another machine.<BR/>I mapped the tortoisesvn to a local drive and chaged the path accordingly but all i have is grayed out menus...and all of them are a premade menu, kind of cluttering things. Can someone help me?<BR/><BR/>For the guys that have this working, has anyone tried a LAN setting?</div>

I installed your setting files and also installed tortoiseSVN but i can add the solution to the repository, i can't commit the solution. It gives me this error "C:\Documents and Settings\gilbert\Belgelerim\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\denemeninkrali is no a working copy. Can't open file: C:\Documents and Settings\gilbert\Belgelerim\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\denemeninkrali\.svn\entries: System cannot find the path". So i checked the document over and over to make sure if i make something wrong but everything was ok. What should i do now?</div>

In the screenshot, it displays a separate toolbar for Subversion.  When I installed this, however, it just dropped all of the options into the pre-existing Tools toolbar, in a rather unattractive manner.  Did I do something wrong, or is there an easy fix for this? Thanks.</div>

Hello jorge,<BR/><BR/>I've tried opening the settings file in wordpad, i've found out that the related directories is hard coded as "c:\\program files\\"... What I did is I replaced the directory string into the target directory of tortoise SVN, and it just works fine. Hope this helps.</div>

Sorry, forgot to say how to add it to the context menus.<BR/><BR/>Right click on the toolbars backgrounds and select "Customize".  From the list in the toolbars tick "Context Menus" - this option is hidden when not in Customize mode.<BR/><BR/>From the new toolbar select "Project and Solution Context Menus".  The "Item" context menu is for an individual file, and the "Solution" is for the solution.  You can probably ignore the rest.<BR/><BR/>To add one of the external tools you need to know which External Tools number maps to the TortoiseSVN command - you can see this in "Customize" mode when looking at the "Tools" menu.  On the "Commands" tab on the "Customize" dialog select "Tools" then drag the items named External Command (number) to the menu/toolbar.<BR/><BR/>Hope this helps.</div>

I have no problems creating the additional external tools for item Commit/Update, but am at a loss on how to assosiate them with the context menu. The only thing missing is the actual ID for the command. I could copy and paste the rest in the settings.<BR/><BR/>Personally I use Tortoise directly from Explorer, however, I have coworkers who are more into the good old VSS UI and would like the icon overlays. I downloaded the Ankh source yesterday and skimmed through the filenames looking for a n instant clue where to look for the overlays, but didn't have the time to look more into it. I guess figuring it out when I have the time shouldn't cause too much trouble creating a simple addin with the functionality of using the correct overlay.<BR/><BR/>However, I like the simplicity of the integration (no coding) and expect to use it frequently.<BR/><BR/>Thank you for your work so far.</div>
</div>

<div class='author'>Garry Bodsworth</div>
<div class='content'>
In order to have a commit/update for an individual file you would need to create a new commit/update command that uses $(ItemPath) and $(ItemDir).  Then you can easily add these to the context menus.<BR/><BR/>Doing the icon overlay is not necessary for me as I use Check For Modifications infrequently.  What I prefer about this integration is that it is a very thin layer wrapping the functionality that really does not get in the way.  I never really care what I've edited or anything like that until I commit.  I've changed the way I work with source control now in comparison to my days battling with VSS, it is actually almost a case of I don't need to even think about the source control.<BR/><BR/>If you want a more comprehensive VSS style integration I recommend having a look at AnkhSVN:<BR/>http://ankhsvn.tigris.org/<BR/>This could also give you a hint at how to do icon overlays ;)</div>

I wouldn't mind having an additional context menu for Commit/Update/etc for individual files/folders. I tried fixing it myself, but couldn't figure out how to refer to commands (or find the id for a command).<BR/><BR/>I've also started looking into a way of making solution explorer use overlay icons from Tortoise/Explorer, but VS extensibility isn't my area ;o) <BR/><BR/>So far I have found this integration to be very sweet ;o)</div>

<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> is always a great choice for source control, and in the summer it looks like there will be an update to version 1.5 with some fairly major features.<br /><br />The most important of these features is the merge tracking which is detailed in <a href="http://blogs.open.collab.net/svn/2007/05/the_subversion__1.html">this blog post</a>.  It is not a problem for a simple life of development, but when you are maintaining multiple branches with multiple requirements and they all need to know what revisions have an haven't been merged you really need to know what is going on.  With Subversion up until the upcoming 1.5 you would just have to be conscientious and meticulous.<br /><br />There is a list of all issue reports that are <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/buglist.cgi?component=subversion&issue_status=NEW&issue_status=STARTED&issue_status=REOPENED&target_milestone=1.5&target_milestone=1.5-consider">targeted for Subversion 1.5</a>.<br /><br />Also for Subversion resources there is a great blog <a href="http://svn-dev.blogspot.com/">here</a> which has more about what the developers are planning (or would like to ideally include).  You can see the Subversion roadmap <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/roadmap.html">here</a>.  There is also an issue list for what <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/buglist.cgi?component=subversion&issue_status=NEW&issue_status=STARTED&issue_status=REOPENED&target_milestone=2.0">could be potentially included in 2.0</a>.  Oh and finally <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/status">the plans for TortoiseSVN</a> in relation to Subversion 1.5.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Edit:</span> Thanks to hwright for the comment that <a href="http://jc.ngo.org.uk/~nik/planet-subversion/">Planet Subversion</a> is an aggregator for Subversion blogs.

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/07/tortoisesvn-and-visual-studio.html">See the update here.</a></span><br /><br />Hi there everyone,<br /><br />Here is an update to the TortoiseSVN integration into Visual Studio 2005.  This update is a fairly major change since this will only have the changes to external tools, menus and toolbars.  This means when you import these settings you get a new menu at the top of the screen (with icons), a new toolbar with proper TortoiseSVN icons, and context menus for solutions and files.<br /><br />You can download the <a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/SubversionToolbarsAndMenus.zip">new settings file here</a> (it is 9k in size compressed).  All you need to do is go to your Tools menu and choose "Import and Export Settings" and follow the instructions.  Ensure the tick box for which settings to import are all ticked.<br /><br />Here are the original posts from the Subversion integration (and old files are still available).<br /><ul><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/subversion-and-tortoisesvn-programmers.html">Subversion and TortoiseSVN - A programmers best friend</a></li><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/subversion-tortoisesvn-integration.html">Subversion : TortoiseSVN Integration into Visual Studio</a> - A vbs script that will add Subversion to your external tools in Visual Studio 2003 and 2005.</li><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/subversion-tortoisesvn-integration_03.html">Subversion : TortoiseSVN Integration into Visual Studio.NET 2005 Again</a></li><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/tortoisesvn-vsnet-2005-good-stuff.html">TortoiseSVN + VS.NET 2005 = Good Stuff</a> - The original vssettings based integration with additional screenshots that still apply.</li><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/tools-for-tortoisesvn.html">Tools for TortoiseSVN</a> - Some recommended tools for TortoiseSVN.</li><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/updated-visual-studio-2005-express-and.html">Updated Visual Studio 2005 Express and TortoiseSVN Integration</a> - The first update to the vssettings implementation.</li></ul><br /><a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/SubversionToolbarsAndMenus.zip">DOWNLOAD SETTINGS FILE</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Edit: </span> Now there is a yet another update - this is now 7k.  This makes a minimum of changes to your IDE as humanly (or inhumanly) possible.  There is still a deficiency in the .vssettings that messes up the build toolbar comboboxes, but this seems unfixable in the current format.<br /><br />Oh, and don't forget to leave some comments as to whether this new stuff is all working for you (along with the new "Add Solution To Repository" functionality.</div>

Just a quick question. The article mentions "Context Menus". Are you talking about context menus that show up when right clicking a file or folder in the solution explorer? Because if that is the case, Eventhough I get everything else working fine, I cant see any context menus. Thanks for such a nice solution man!</div>

This is for TortoiseSVN, not TortoiseCVS.  It is probable that a similar solution can be used for that source control system.<BR/><BR/>Check out TortoiseSVN at http://tortoisesvn.net<BR/><BR/>The latest version of the Visual Studio settings is here:<BR/>http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/07/tortoisesvn-and-visual-studio.html</div>

I have done as per your setting, but i am not getting file wise Update/Commit/Get Lock/Release Lock/Revert. So i can get same way like i am doing it in VSS. It will be great if someone can solve this issue. And i am only interested in VS2005, Subverion, TortoiseSVN & vssettings. Not at all interested in any other tools. I think Garry's Bit can solve this. Please help me.</div>

If you want to get complete Subversion integration in Visual Studio please have a look at <A HREF="http://www.visualsvn.com/" REL="nofollow">VisualSVN</A>. It wraps TortoiseSVN UI too but provides also seamless support for file operations (renames, moves etc.) and shows status in Solution Explorer. Costs just $49.</div>

Hi there,<BR/><BR/>Just to answer a couple of previous questions:<BR/><BR/>There is no internal way to resolve a conflict at the moment.<BR/><BR/>It is impossible to add icons to the front of folders since it uses the "External Tools" feature so it can work easily with the Express Editions as well as the Professional ones.<BR/><BR/>If the command being run is wrong (Dotsfuscator) it is possible the order your External Tools is incorrect or when you imported the settings they may not have all been applied.</div>

This looks promising however when I try to execute the "Update" command from the Subversion menu it seems to launch DotFuscater and not do anything else?</div>

I've just started using the whole SVN/Tortoise/VS2005 stuff... it seems to me that you can't do a checkout from within VS and need to do it from Tortoise directly.  I just used Tortoise to check out to a working dir then opened up in VS and it seemed to work.<br /><br />Coming from an eclipse/CVS background what would be nice is the "decorators" in VS that tell you that you're working with a checked out file.  That is in vs if you change a file, you get a red exclamation mark to remind you that you need to commit your changes.  I might be asking a bit much here though :)<br /><br />Regards,<br />Anthony.</div>

No problems, glad it works for you now.  Just out of interest are you using Professional or Express?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Garry</div>

Weird. When importing the settings file again, I selected the "External Tools List" checkbox and now everything shows up ok. Thanks :)</div>

They are external tools, so if the executable is not in the place it expects then it is possible that it can't find it.  Is it also disabled on the external tools menu?<br /><br />The settings make the assumption TortoiseSVN is in the default installation location.  If this is the case then do a search and replace on the settings file for:c:\\program files\\TortoiseSVN\\bin\\tortoiseproc.exe<br />And replace it with the location that yours is installed (keeping the double slashes).<br /><br />If that is not the case then try reimporting the settings as VS2005 has this wonderful knack of getting confused when loading settings.<br /><br />Garry</div>

Hi,<br />I've imported the settings and everything seems to be ok, but toolbar is greyed out and the menus don't appear. What am I doing wrong?<br /><br />Thanks for working on this :)<br /><br />Cheers, Jordan</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/07/tortoisesvn-and-visual-studio.html">See the update here.</a></span><br /><br />I've made an update to the TortoiseSVN integration for Visual Studio 2005.  This is from a comment by Dean about adding a solution to the repository.  This has been added to the menu, toolbar, and context menu for solutions.<br /><br />Unfortunately this update has only been tested on Visual C++ 2005 Express for the moment as this is all I have to hand, but I am pretty sure these settings should also work for Visual Studio full versions (see the link at the end of this post).  I'll update the Visual Studio 2005 Pro versions at some point during the week, or discover I don't need to and only maintain one file (which would mean not going grey as fast).<br /><br />You can read the original article <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/tortoisesvn-vsnet-2005-good-stuff.html">here and see some screenshots as well</a>.<br /><br />You can download the .vssettings for Visual Studio <a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/SubversionSettingsVC2005Express.zip">here</a>.</div>

In order to make my TortoiseSVN as useful as possible, I use some external tools to maximise productivity.  It took a while to find the right set up but I am happy with it now.<br /><br />For merging with a three-way diff when there are conflicks I found <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/">KDiff3</a>, which seems to not be considered as sexy or well-known as most other tools.  But it does the job admirably with plenty of powerful features.  Certainly it does not look fully Windows-native, but that should not put you off if you want to use this powerful tool, and after all it is very rare that Subversion wants me to do a three-way diff.<br /><br />For standard diffs I use <a href="http://winmerge.org/">WinMerge</a>.  Simply it is the best Windows based diff and merge tool I have ever used.  It is powerful and intuitive, but is unfortunately limited to two-way diffs.  If it did do the three-way diffs I would not be using KDiff3.<br /><br />For viewing patch files (unified diffs) I use <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a> which has nice highlighting, but it very rare that I will have a need to look at these patch files.<br /><br />After installing TortoiseSVN, install KDiff3 as it sets up your TortoiseSVN environment for you.  Then install WinMerge and choose <span style="font-style:italic;">"WinMergeU.exe"</span> as the diff viewer.  Then install Notepad2 and set it up as the unified diff viewer.  Doing it in this order means that you can let KDiff3's installation set up the bindings, and then configure the other ones by had as KDiff3's commandline isn't overly simple for TortoiseSVN.</div>
