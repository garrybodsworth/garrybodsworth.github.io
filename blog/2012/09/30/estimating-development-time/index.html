It has been a crazy week where at the beginning nothing existed and on Friday the project was demoed live with all the functionality working. &nbsp;In this compressed five day lifecycle it brought into sharp clarity &nbsp;many aspects of software development. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve always been able to estimate project length but there was no science in it, I always operated on gut feeling and put in healthy margins of error.<br /><br />I was one of the cogs in this project but before I go into breaking down the project there were some other factors helping this development be a success:<br /><br /><ul><li>Someone leading the project who made sure requirements were locked down and made sure there was no feature creep (within reason).</li><li>Testers were on from day one, planning how to test and then seeing through all manner of test regimens.</li><li>Working with smart people.</li><li>Good tools for source code management, documentation, and bug tracking.</li></ul><div>The thing that was really scary for me as a project was how my time broke down:</div><div><ul><li>1 day coding</li><li>2 days integration</li><li>2 days testing and polishing</li></ul><div>The critical aspect here is I spent one day out of five working on pure code and design. &nbsp;This should be apparent to developers that coding is not the only task in delivering software projects. &nbsp;By getting something that was working in half a day also gave other people something real to code against rather than trying to hope integration would happen.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>The next bit was two days of integration, this involved tidying up the code for deployment, working out installers, dependencies and so on. &nbsp;Then also it was a case of working out how all of this will work seamlessly for the end user. &nbsp;This also involved working out how certain bits of the operating system would work when you don&#8217;t have user contexts to depend on that run as administrator, because after all most devs have their machines configured like this. &nbsp;Having this installer is critical for running proper end to end tests and ensuring the end-user will get the best experience.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then we&#8217;ve got testing, this is unit-testing (well actually not a lot of that in a way), functional testing, and integration testing. On a tight deadline some of this is manual and not fully automated.</div><div><br /></div><div>In amongst all this it was a case of making sure documentation was available for all aspects of the project, from end-user, through development and API right through to testing documents and lists of tests.</div><div><br /></div><div>I suppose this thing that people reading this is if you work out how long it will take you to code, multiply that by five.</div></div>
