<p>I&#8217;ve been having to write a lot of C code recently, and it makes me pine for some features of C++ because of the verbosity of some portions of code. It made me consider what really changes the way you code in C++ on comparison to C.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are features like inheritance, but that really just manages the function overriding that is implicit.  There is templates whilst discounting template meta programming is just a glorified way of avoiding code duplication.  There is obviously the more aggressive type checking which is handy but doesn&#8217;t really change that much about your coding style.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what is this feature?  Destructors.  Immediately by adding that feature you change the way you can code and also by avoiding some C verbosity you avoid memory leaks.  This opens up the whole realm of RAII and the code scoping rules start to take on a different life because you can execute code when objects begin to fall out of scope and are freed.  This code then kind of discourages gotos (I really hate those) because you are relying more on the stack unwinding than remembering to malloc/free.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> I reckon if I had destructors for the C code I have written in the context of structs then I could have had a lot less code.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

Developing on ARM is a minefield.&nbsp; Each platform is different (even if they look the same) and you are lucky if any of the software is not covered by NDA or some prohibitive SDK cost for experimentation.<br /><br />People have obviously heard of the Raspberry Pi but mid-to-lat 2011 there was anotehr project starting with a company called <a href="http://rhombus-tech.net/">Rhombus-Tech</a> where they wanted to create a proper CPU card and also have all the software GPL compliant.&nbsp; This is exciting because you can then get the hardware and with the software available create what you want to.&nbsp; They went around trying to find the hardware that could potentially have GPL compliant software.&nbsp; The project has become a CPU card that uses the legacy PCMCIA form factor but re-tasks it entirely for a pluggable processor.&nbsp; The spec is called the <a href="http://elinux.org/Embedded_Open_Modular_Architecture/EOMA-68">EOMA-68</a>.<br /><br />Enter the Allwinner A10, a seriously cheap piece of kit ($7 per chip in volume) which is a Cortex A8 with MALI 400 graphics, DDR3 memory and has a BSP capable of decoding 2160p video.&nbsp; The company behind it Allwinner want to be GPL compliant and have been providing source code for the kernel and the other bits.&nbsp; The A10 has started to appear in tablets and set-top boxes and the fully integrated platforms are very cheap.&nbsp; I picked a capacitive touch 7 inch tablet off eBay for £86 including next day postage.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.cnx-software.com/2012/03/20/allwinner-a10-cortex-a8-based-hackable-mele-a1000-android-stb/">Mele A1000</a> set top box is the platform of choice that people have started to pre-emptively use whilst waiting for the Rhombus Tech project to take off and it costs about £80.<br /><br />The Rhombus Tech spec for the Allwinner A10 is <a href="http://rhombus-tech.net/allwinner_a10/">here</a> and you can sign up for <a href="http://rhombus-tech.net/allwinner_a10/orders/">preorders for the alpha/beta/release boards here</a>.<br /><br />So the real exciting bit about this is potentially all the software is out there to construct a decent Linux distribution to build toys and products on.<br /><br />The main kernel development and tidying up is occurring <a href="https://github.com/amery/linux-allwinner">here</a> and is even being rebased on the 3.3 kenel as well as the Android one.&nbsp; The u-boot repository for getting it booting is <a href="https://github.com/amery/uboot-allwinner">here</a>.&nbsp; There is a partial code dump for the hardware video decoding <a href="https://github.com/amery/allwinner-a10-video">here</a> although it looks like it is some of the user space code.&nbsp; There are some repositories of core Android libraries <a href="https://github.com/arpandeb">here</a> and there are some board files for the Allwinner <a href="https://github.com/arpandeb/allwinner_board_files">here</a>.&nbsp; It looks like in the board files there is the OpenGL ES 2.0 and EGL shared objects <a href="https://github.com/arpandeb/allwinner_board_files/tree/master/crane-common/egl">here</a>.<br /><br />There are also a couple of good articles about building a custom Android for Allwinner A10 based appliances - <a href="http://arpandeb.com/03/2012/tech-guides/how-to-build-custom-rom-for-allwinner-a10-based-android-tablets-a-tutorial-and-guide.html">part 1</a> and <a href="http://arpandeb.com/03/2012/android-how-to-guides/how-to-build-custom-rom-for-allwinner-a10-based-android-tablets-part-ii.html">part 2</a>.&nbsp; There are also lots of resources for board hacking at the <a href="http://rhombus-tech.net/">Rhombus Tech</a> website and also some on the <a href="http://elinux.org/Hack_A10_devices">Embedded Linux wiki</a>.<br /><br />So if you fancy some cheap ARM development its worth signing up on the <a href="http://rhombus-tech.net/allwinner_a10/orders/">orders page</a>.<br /><br />Now I need to get hacking on that tablet&#8230;.</div>

These are some other random highs and lows from the Camvine experience, lifting the veil on some bits and pieces.<br /><br />What would I have rather have done with those three-and-a-half years?&nbsp; Nothing else.&nbsp; It&#8217;ll be in my blood for a while longer.<br /><br /><b>HIGH</b><br /><br />We did the Cambridge Tech Demo Night.&nbsp; Quentin had prepared lots of slides to cram into 7 minutes, and I was going to simultaneously do a full unboxing from scratch (with no cheating) simultaneously to how how easy it was to set up.&nbsp; Unfortunately projector connection failure caused us to throw out the slides and Quentin fired up a web browser on some Windows machine that was part of the University network that by default was controlling the projector.&nbsp; He talked, fired up the browser and I started unboxing and connecting cables, within about three minutes we were connected, registered and uploading content to the display.&nbsp; The projector failure was the best thing to happen to us because we showed the product end-to-end in such a short period, we even got a standing ovation - scary and heartwarming stuff.<br /><br /><b>LOW</b><br /><br />I was always asked to evaluate a new hardware platform, which I would get working.&nbsp; Then I was always expected to support it without any hardware because £200 was too much to keep a small PC around.&nbsp; Unfortunately for other things like Windows licences the company was able to pour money down the drain.<br /><br /><b>HIGH</b><br /><br />We had a crazy test rig.&nbsp; It involved a full server in a Xen VM with two NICs so there was a fake Internet hanging off the back of it.&nbsp; This was always our saviour, we insstantly knew if software updates or networking were broken because we had the physical hardware dangling off the back, not some mock representation.&nbsp; This obviously couldn&#8217;t save all problems but it meant the customers rarely saw a broken release.&nbsp; It was horrible and verbose, but I saw the power in it being an integral part of the software development.<br /><br /><b>LOW</b><br /><br />Not only did we have the major SSD failure of 2011, we had them replaced.&nbsp; Then they died again, but this was a quick hotswap because we did not trust the management services we were paying for any more.&nbsp; What I also discovered was the server grade Intel drives were actually cheap&#8217;n&#8217;nasty Crucials for consumers.&nbsp; Because of the work I did reducing the database load we were completely fine back on spinny disks.<br /><br /><b>HIGH</b><br /><br />Working on Linux full-time.&nbsp; Working on Mac full-time.&nbsp; Going nowhere near Windows.&nbsp; And making sure my Macs and Linux machines had awesome decals.<br /><br /><b>LOW</b><br /><br />Stopping working on the Mac.&nbsp; I realised I was using a VM with Linux the whole time on my Mac so I got myself an Asus U36JC which was an awesome laptop that I had configured perfectly for Linux.<br /><br /><b>HIGH</b><br /><br />Rewriting the network stack to be pure Python.&nbsp; The code is all here https://github.com/garrybodsworth/coda_network - this means NTLM proxies worked, streaming worked, and all the intricacies of networking worked as they were supposed to.&nbsp; Although I never got an official document to say I could open-source it, I did it anyway.<br /><br /><b>LOW</b><br /><br />The Windows player.&nbsp; As alluded to we had to have a Windows player and the whole feature creep and ignoring my initial specification documents helped make it a disaster.&nbsp; To be honest, I have no problem with a windows player, but it took two developers for over a year and it never got released in the end.&nbsp; If two developers had been working full time on the thing we were actually selling then I think it would have been a huge win all round for the customers because all the features needed would have been done.<br /><br /><b>HIGH</b><br /><br />Having an iOS player.&nbsp; This did get released.&nbsp; Michael Dales did excellent work on one day a week to get this done in a realistic timescale.&nbsp; I think technically it was a damn good idea and something to promote, unfortunately the comany itself didn&#8217;t know what to do with it so it languished in marketing purgatory.<br /><br /><b>LOW</b><br /><br />Battling with ATi binary drivers, that was massively hard work, but I eventually had it so it could stay up for a significant period of time before the ASIC locked.&nbsp; The main culprit was the XVBA decoding seemed to cause memory to eventually go mad.&nbsp; The nvidia drivers had their fair share of issues like breaking vsync rendering for rotated displays which meant I ended having to make everything a surface in clutter and rotate that(!)&nbsp; Adobe Flash support was similarly problematic mainly because of the underpowered CPUs we were using.<br /><br /><b>HIGH</b><br /><br />Programming the initial 35 batch of CODApods on my own in the shed on a Friday with Tron playing on the TV above my desk.&nbsp; Tron was being played through a CODApod of course!<br /><br /><b>LOW</b><br /><br />Being forced to evaluate hardware from people that were basically chancing it and were realistically years away from having a fully working system.&nbsp; I ended up sinking way too much time into that.<br /><br /><b>HIGH</b><br /><br />The people who I feel embodied Camvine, Quentin, Sarah, Michael, and Thomas, without them there would have been no company to try and build.&nbsp; John Naughton was also integral to the initial spirit.<br /><br />And all the other people in no order and if I forgot anyone slap me round the head in the pub - Brian Boakes, Martin Waddell, Joseph Newman, Jonathan Thackray, Richard Morrison, Tomasz Wojciechowski, William Baer, Rob Berwick, Nick Brook, Dan Clemens, Allison Holloway, Steve Hales, John Martyn, John Naughton, Diego Barrow, saafad Khan, Emily Poulton, Breton Saunders, Justin Drake, Glenn Moodie, and Adam Brunning.</div>

Maybe I could also call this &#8220;what was i doing for the last three-and-a-half years?&#8221;&nbsp; Today could really be described as the final day of Camvine&#8217;s existence, even though I left at the end of December (something I would rather not have done, I&#8217;ll explain later) this is something immensely dear to my heart, so I thought I would weave my thread through it&#8217;s patchwork.&nbsp; So, what was Camvine?&nbsp; It was an Internet connected digital signage system where you could control your displays anywhere around the world through your web browser.<br /><br />I was working at DisplayLink, a company set up by Quentin Stafford-Fraser, but wasn&#8217;t enjoying my work, so I was looking at startups for a good challenge and found a startup founded by Quentin Stafford-Fraser&#8230;&nbsp; The weird thing was I had never met him, but thought it would be an interesting challenge.&nbsp; I still have no idea what made them take a chance on me, although my profile on the website called me a veteran, which definitely made me feel old.&nbsp; I think one of the major factors was that I at least had an idea of how the hardware worked, you see the first product of CodaBox + CodaLinks was based on the ethernet nivos from DisplayLink.&nbsp; They were an interesting proposition, very low power and low cost, but also not massively capable pieces of hardware, so one small low powered Intel Atom powered central machine could run up to 20 displays.<br /><br />So I joined Camvine mid-2008 and I ended up working in <a href="http://twitpic.com/3hp4ey">&#8220;The Shed&#8221;</a> which is<a href="http://twitpic.com/3nt06z"> a studio</a> at the bottom of a garden in Cambridge, where ndiyo and DisplayLink also started.&nbsp; It was my first chance to do commercial Python development and it was an exciting free-flowing environment.&nbsp; We even had Fun Fridays where we could work on stuff not on the roadmap, quite a few cool features came out of that single day of the week, unfortunately some did not get integrated like transitions code I had working quite sweetly on the CodaLinks.&nbsp; The website was really awesome evolving into a drag and drop user interface for controlling your displays and content modelled on the iTunes style UI.<br /><br />Around that time my wife fell pregnant with our first child, you would think that startup life and children do not mix, but I went head-first into it all and it was immensely rewarding.<br /><br />Soon, we are heading towards a &#8220;The Pivot&#8221;&#8230;&nbsp; The team needs introductions, we have Quentin Stafford-Fraser, CEO, ideas, maverick, like Hannibal in the A-Team.&nbsp; We have Michael Dales, CTO, uber-hacker.&nbsp; Thomas Hunger, developer, the brains.&nbsp; Sarah McKeon, the office manager, the glue that holds the company together and keeping it running (every company needs a Sarah).&nbsp; And me, lowest rung on the ladder.<br /><br />Not long after me a sales and marketing director joined the company whose expertise was in the advertising arena, so we started to target advertisers.&nbsp; Whilst CodaLinks were in interesting esoteric proposition for communicating they were not what the advertising industry craved which is tons of rich content (read: Flash) and high definition videos.&nbsp; The advertising industry and digital signage are not a good place to be, but I&#8217;ll come onto that.&nbsp; So now we hit the pivot point around April 2009, which incidentally is the month my daughter was borrn.&nbsp; We grab some Asus EeeBoxes and decide to use an Intel Atom N270 based system and start writing code for it (partially based on porting our playback code for the CodaLinks).&nbsp; I start hitting the base platform with coding hammers (we were based on Ubuntu so we stauck with that) and we ended up with a Jaunty franken-distro set up mainly by me and Thomas.&nbsp; By September we are shipping EeeBoxes to a potential customer needing to get rid of an unmanageable legacy system, the weird thing was I had this Acer Revo sitting on my desk and I couldn&#8217;t get the damn thing to boot Linux on a USB key, then somehow I worked out how to make it work by altering the heads/sectors on the key (I&#8217;m sure I blogged about it at the time).&nbsp; It had an nvidia ION as the GPU which was very interesting, for a start thhe binary drivers were much better than the Intel ones at the time (I was one of the original users of the KMS drivers trying to get it all working), also it had the ability to do video decoding on the GPU.&nbsp; Because the driver quality was so good it blew the Eeeboxes out of the water with the same CPU, so this became our hardware platform in what seemed like overnight, unfortunately we did have to write off about 20 Eeebox units at the expense of the company, embarressing on my part, but totally the right decision.<br /><br />Sales and marketing decided the new product should be called the CODApod, urgh, horrible name!&nbsp; Internally I called it the incredicoda which not only sounding quite unhinged is really easy to grep for in source code, as a developer this is important.<br /><br />The advertising industry is rubbish for digital signage, they want everything perfect, which is surprisingly difficult to achieve.&nbsp; You end up having to trade things on multiple axes which are robustness, speed, quality of output, and accuracy.&nbsp; You can throw more staff at solving these issues but that is not an option at some startups like this running on a shoestring.&nbsp; One of the things you can&#8217;t explain no matter how hard you try is that displaying a web page is not a no=op, you have to download resources, start rendering, get some more resources, render some more, then you might be complete ready for display.&nbsp; Even with everything cached in memory that is not a no-op.<br /><br />The most important thing to get the software shipped just 5 months after deciding on this was a robust software update, then things could be fixed in the field remotely.&nbsp; I had made software update more robust since joining Camvine, and continually strived to make it unbreakable.&nbsp; We evolved the software over the next six months into something quite impressive with hardware accelerated codecs (we paid Fluendo to finish development of VDPAU), newer, better web browsers and robust PDf viewers.&nbsp; Unfortunately a bombshell hit in December 2009 when Thomas Hunger decided to leave for the bright lights of London.&nbsp; The months that followed were a blur, me and Michael were support and development, answering the phone and support requests as well as me developing the client hardware and him on the website.&nbsp; It was simultaneously awesome and horrible, horrible volume of work, but I think we were a well oiled machine with just two people in the shed.&nbsp; We stuck our headphones in and got our heads down and moved forward as well as maintaining all that was there.<br /><br />Some more people joined, Quentin stepped down as CEO, and we got a new CEO.&nbsp; The next bombshell for me was losing Michael as CTO.&nbsp; I was profoundly gutted, not only was it amazing to work with him, I consider him a good friend.&nbsp; His reasons for leaving, I will leave up to him, but losing him as CTO and protector of the Camvine faith is the worst thing to ever happen to the company.&nbsp; It took me a while to realise that he should have become CEO (although obviously he would not want that job), but that would have been what was right and proper for the company.&nbsp; I had a crazy idea that I should take over website development and hand CODApod development over to someone else, since I knew the most about the system and Camvien was proving to be very poor at hiring, even not allowing me to advertise on some of the places I wanted to.&nbsp; Michael left October 2010, and the handover was an unmitigated disaster.&nbsp; I was forced to work on attempting to make a playlist perfect for an advertising potential customer, who was never going to put their money where their mouth was.&nbsp; I was doing this instead of doing a decent handover, luckily Michael was still available one day a week.<br /><br />I got my head down and obsessed about the website.&nbsp; Christmas was a nightmare because I was now the only thing between our website and total oblivion, especially with issues like the server going up to load 30 at 8:30am every morning.&nbsp; I ended up by March 2011 restructuring pretty much all the deployment to use nginx, gunicorn, and Fabric, the tools of the modern Django coder.&nbsp; The databases were split onto new machines, the load balancing worked pretty great.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the CODApod was essentially dead.&nbsp; The company had decided that they wanted a Windows CODA player, so this would now suck two man-years of effort into a black hole as it was never officially released.&nbsp; During this time the only development on the CODApod was what I did in what i laughably called my &#8220;spare time&#8221;, also the CODApod software had to be ported to work on as many hardware platforms as possible (ATi, nvidia, Intel Core) where there were no scheduled developer resources.&nbsp; I was doing all this whilst also running and developing and being on-call for the website.&nbsp; I felt really sorry for the customers knowing no client side developments were happening that could improve their hardware further.&nbsp; Somehow I managed to have a release of CODAsoft available two months after starting work in my spare time, and I kept it up to date until the day I finished.&nbsp; It worked flawlessly on Intel graphics (945 through to I think Ivy Bridge), ATI (open-source and binary drivers with hardware acceleration) and nvidia (everything the binary driver supports and with hardware acceleration).<br /><br />We left the shed in 2011.&nbsp; A very sad day for me.&nbsp; The weird thing was the physical seperation matching the logical seperation of the company actually was a great thing that was not appreciated by some people.&nbsp; By moving into one huge space things started to bleed into one another and there was an immense lack of self-control by certain roles.<br /><br />The moment I knew I had to leave Camvine completely and utterly was Father&#8217;s Day 2011.&nbsp; We were out in the middle of nowhere with me, my wife, daughter and father-in-law, and there was basically no phone reception.&nbsp; I got an odd phonecall and discovered the servers were down and attempted to debug what was going on through a phone call and intermittent data coverage.&nbsp; Basically we were screwed.&nbsp; For a bit of context, I was forced to outsource database management to someone else in order to alleviate my workload, and we ended up with two SSD based servers with master-slave, back-ups and database dumps every day.&nbsp; Everything failed, but it had been failing for a month.&nbsp; Hard drives?&nbsp; Broken serving corrupted data silently.&nbsp; Backups of the HDs?&nbsp; Failing silently.&nbsp; Database dumps?&nbsp; Failing as well.&nbsp; What happened was they decided to upgrade a backup program which caused the mysql process to restart, which is where all hell broke loose.&nbsp; I managed to get in the office at 5pm Sunday and was there reconstructing enough of a business to open doors again the Monday morning otherwise we should have just shut up shop.&nbsp; I have no idea how I did it, but enough was workking by 1am and Quentin was great moral support.&nbsp; The next two weeks of 14 hour days involved recreating as much data as possible which was almost everything, which was something to at least be proud of.&nbsp; The thought of this still makes me feel sick.&nbsp; The write rate of the web service was blamed as it was doing something like 50 per second, so I rewrote portions and got it down to 0.5 per socond.&nbsp; This was not the problem and it happened again but the recovery procedure was much more robust in that instance.<br /><br />The real kicker - it happened after we have a Pingdom report with one month being 100% uptime.<br /><br />I said I wanted to leave but I was convinced to stay by being told that things will be worked out to make my workload more manageable.&nbsp; Needless to say this never happened, and I got a payrise which was definitely not what I wanted.&nbsp; What I wanted was Camvine to succeed and I wanted to have a healthier relationship with my work which was continually getting more and more as time went on.&nbsp; I was forced out not by a specific person but the system I was working under, with four developers being wasted on professional services and the Windows player, it required way too much heavy lifting.<br /><br />So I started to look, and ended up at a great start-up called Bromium.&nbsp; This all took longer than I would have liked.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I handed in my notice, I found that period was made to be immensely uncomfortable.&nbsp; At least I had Italian Spider-Man to brighten the days.&nbsp; I finished December 2011 with my DNA all over the place, massive amounts of website and codapod source.<br /><br />So what did I use to build the CODApod?&nbsp; Ubuntu, GTK, WebkitGTK, poppler, clutter, connman, Python, and lots more.&nbsp; I was really proud of the clutter Python based desktop compositor I wrote.&nbsp; If people tell you Python is too slow they are wrong, 60 FPS every time.&nbsp; The whole thing used process abstraction for robustness so bits could fail easily without taking the whole system down.&nbsp; Everything failed gracefully.&nbsp; People told me they could tell it was a Camvine system because of the smooth tickers (using OpenGL textures).<br /><br />The website was all Python and Django.&nbsp; I&#8217;m really glad I took that on, because I discovered I love website development and I think I did a really half decent job, apart from the database disaster of 2011.&nbsp; The site was dealing with 1 million requests per day and didn&#8217;t break sweat on very modest hardware.<br /><br />One month after I left it was announced Camvine was going into administration.&nbsp; This was a massive shock to me since I didn&#8217;t know it was on the cards and thought there was 6 months money still in the bank.&nbsp; Subsequently on seeing some financials the bloodletting had to happen and the company was never going to turn the corner to profitiability.&nbsp; I find it annoying myself because I did not want to take out too much money from the company so made sure my wages were kept at the low-end whch most people see as idiotic, but I see as my commitment and investment in the company.&nbsp; I made sure I helped people as much as I could to find more work and to help out in any way I could, after all it felt like a piece of me still.<br /><br />In administration it feels like people are dividing up a piece of me.&nbsp; I care immensely about the product and what the company could have been capable of.&nbsp; The codapod is the almost as old as my daughter and the time I have sepnt working on Camvine beyond what is contractually obligated is time I haven&#8217;t spent with my daughter.&nbsp; I still wouldn&#8217;t trade it (apart from the horrible ending) as technically I feel I have done great work and I have grown immensely.<br /><br />The pain I feel that people are trading my code without me with is huge and I look forward to not being near to it in the future because maybe the distance will let me move on.</div>

Today I&#8217;ve just uploaded a fork of <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/%7Ejch/software/polipo/">polipo</a> to my Github account.&nbsp; it is a caching proxy server which works really well with a tiny amount of resources. It is primarily driven by Unix development so it has a version that works on Cygwin and a version that is not considered complete or tested that can use the Mingw toolchain.<br /><br />I wanted to get it working with Visual Studio and I stumbled across some work <a href="http://code.google.com/p/polipovc/">here at polipovc</a> where someone got it working with Visual Studio.&nbsp; It is a code dump rather than a series of patches, so I took the <a href="https://github.com/jech/polipo">polipo git repository on Github</a> and forked it.&nbsp; I then applied the changes as a series of patches making minimal changes in each one and tried to normalise it with the project coding style.&nbsp; I also created a solution for Visual Studio 2010.&nbsp; It compiles for 32-bit and 64-bit (but just ignore the swatches of warnings).<br /><br />The on-disk cache seems to not be working properly right now so I might look a bit more closely into why that is the case.&nbsp; To be honest the directory checks need to be factored out.<br /><br />You can see my <a href="https://github.com/garrybodsworth/polipo">polipo github repository here</a>.</div>

Perhaps I should have titled it &#8220;The Tale Of Two Tablets&#8221;.&nbsp; A few months ago I picked up myself and Asus Eee Note, the main selling point to me was the integrated Wacom digitiser making me believe this could be a useful sketching device.&nbsp; Unfortunately the software on it was a custom operating system based on Qt (framebuffer) and was pretty deficient from a sketching point of view.&nbsp; So I offloaded the thing off on eBay&#8230;.<br /><br />Then I heard about the new version of the <a href="http://www.improvelectronics.com/">Boogie Board</a> which is less of a tablet, more of a paper replacement, but it would have a saving capability for pictures.&nbsp; All for the price of £100 + VAT.&nbsp; The Boogie Board RIP has a 9.5 inch area for drawing on and can even capture those renderings. The way the display on previous boogie boards worked was impressive in that it only consumed power to blank the display, and putting pressure on the display caused an image to be formed.<br /><br />I did wonder how on earth they would have taken that technology and been able to capture the images.&nbsp; But the guys at Improv Electronics are much smarter than that, it looks like the way it works is there is a separate digitiser to the screen, so it is kind of like a graphics tablet where you can see the image you are also drawing.&nbsp; You have to wake the digitiser to start using it and press the Save button to store the file.&nbsp; The digitiser stores the file in a vector-based PDF leading to some quite nice images.<br /><br />The primary reason to get hold of it was for sketching and note-taking.&nbsp; Also, I wanted to actually be able to use the device on Linux, and since when you connect it, it just appears as a mass storage device meaning a win there compared to other connection mechanisms (like in the Eee Note).<br /><br />The device itself is light and flimsy in the best possible way, making it easy to hold and also you don&#8217;t worry too much about protecting the device rather than actually using it.&nbsp; The battery apparently lasts for a week on a charge, but I have no idea the amount of charge my device is currently holding because it has no indicator.&nbsp; This is not necessarily a problem because the device is ludicrously stripped down and simple, so I see it has having an incredibly simple UI.<br /><br />The only criticism I have about the device is more subtle than most people would notice.&nbsp; Because the digitiser and display are separate devices they seem to work at different resolutions.&nbsp; The digitiser is highly accurate by the look of it generating cleaner and thinner lines, but the reactive display generates thicker less accurate lines.&nbsp; This may also be due to the design of the pen nib.&nbsp; The pen itself is required to capture input, and I found it comfortable to use.<br /><br />Overall the Boogie Board Rip is a cool little device good at the job it was designed to do.&nbsp; I&#8217;m still trying to work out the best way it will be my digital sketchpad but it is the device I have seen get closest to what I want (in fact if they did a really large A3 version that would be awesome).&nbsp; The guys at Improv Electronics have done an excellent job.<br /><br />You can buy them in the <a href="http://gbp.improvelectronics.com/">UK from Improv Electronics</a> for £120 including VAT.<br /><br />This is a picture comparing the PDF output to theactual display - you can see finer lines on the image compared to the screen where some lines bleed into one another.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6iTt5FIWg6s/TsQr5GlQ8WI/AAAAAAAAABY/6Y0DCgnWjds/s1600/boogie1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6iTt5FIWg6s/TsQr5GlQ8WI/AAAAAAAAABY/6Y0DCgnWjds/s320/boogie1.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />And some quick two minute sketches of Rodimus and Megatron. <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2aP1SvcOtCs/TsQsp_xwrNI/AAAAAAAAABg/953HRJp_5Es/s1600/rodimus.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2aP1SvcOtCs/TsQsp_xwrNI/AAAAAAAAABg/953HRJp_5Es/s320/rodimus.png" width="237" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--AoVIjaBCXY/TsQtMapbKiI/AAAAAAAAABo/iu6BuIpxl60/s1600/megatron.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="226" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--AoVIjaBCXY/TsQtMapbKiI/AAAAAAAAABo/iu6BuIpxl60/s320/megatron.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /></div>

I saw that a project called <a href="http://www.openelec.tv/">OpenELEC</a> (Open Embedded Linux Entertainment Centre) got released released recently.&nbsp; What is interesting about it is not so much the fact that it is a fast booting XBMC distribution, but the fact that it is an embedded Linux system for x86 platforms with minimal size and uses the latest components.<br /><br />I can vouch for the most important thing when dealig with media is having the latest graphics dependencies on Linux.&nbsp; You tend not to have long-lived stable releases and most issues and advances are done in the day-to-day development.<br /><br />The source code is available on Github <a href="https://github.com/OpenELEC/OpenELEC.tv">here</a>.&nbsp; Going through I can see it has Python, GTK+, and Python gobject bindings, Linux 3.1rc10 kernel and lots more.&nbsp; Even though it is a cut-down minimal system it doesn&#8217;t lack handy things like ssh and a text editor.<br /><br />The final images are a mere 100MB or there about in size.&nbsp; There are scripts to create the USB install key and it even has an automated update system.&nbsp; There are optimised builds for ION and AMD Fusion as well as a few other platforms.<br /><br />If you want an XBMC computer then I can think of more heavyweight ways to get it, but if you want it to boot in 10 seconds and you don&#8217;t need to cusomise it too much then this would be a really good choice.<br /><br />To me it looks like an ideal platform for trying out different media type applications (say kiosks or other media centres) with not a huge amount of code as the base system looks pretty solid.&nbsp; I reckon something like Clutter&#8217;s <a href="http://media-explorer.github.com/">Media Explorer</a> could be quite good on it.</div>

Now with EuroPython being held outside the UK, the PyCon UK takes on more significance.&nbsp; Run by the same guys and now relocated to Coventry this year was a triumph.&nbsp; Something like 200 people attended for the weekend log conference which is pretty impressive.<br /><br />The venue was excellent.&nbsp; The most important aspect was all meals were supplied at the venue (and were all very tasty).&nbsp; This meant that people tended not to drift off and hopefully that helped the mingling.&nbsp; Some of the rooms were a little small but nobody seemed to forsee how well attended the weekend would be with lots of last minute tickets.<br /><br />The topic that dominated the entire conference was computing and education.&nbsp; Specifically the useless nature of ICT courses and the complete lack of the next generation of coders coming through.&nbsp; The obvious technology on show and being discussed was RaspberryPi.&nbsp; There was also the BBC CodeLab host attempting to evoke those old feelings of the BBC Model B.&nbsp; Basically the conclusion comes down to there is no will in government for changing the nature of computing in schools and it will require hackers in number making the changes piece by piece themselves.<br /><br />The Coding Dojo was a lot of fun using the task of Maze Generation.&nbsp; We managed to lash enough together five minutes form the end and I think we surprised ourselves by it working.&nbsp; Also the web development open forum was good, maybe I spoke too much in that&#8230;.&nbsp; and I managed to get a demo of <a href="http://camvine.com/">Camvine</a> in there.&nbsp; There was also three thought-provoking and entertaining keynotes.<br /><br />As always the people there made the conference.&nbsp; The team who ran it all did a sterling job, even better than their previous EuroPythons.&nbsp; Team 4 in the Code Dojo did a great bit of work, Matt, Safe, Adrian, and Menno.&nbsp; I also got to speak to the keynote speaker Allison Randal at the meal, in fact the whole table was entertaining.<br /><br />So my recommendation, even if you don&#8217;t use Python much, is to go to PyCon UK next year because I am pretty sure you will learn something or meet some really interesting people.</div>

The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> project has got a lot of coverage today thanks to the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/aug/28/ict-changes-needed-national-curriculum">article in the Guardian</a> written by <a href="http://memex.naughtons.org/">John Naughton</a>.<br /><br />The fundamental problem has never been the lack of cheap hardware.  Even in this day and age it is not the lack of quality freely available tools.&nbsp; A kid who has the propensity to be a hacker nowadays would invariably have Linux installed with the myriad of tools available, and also doing that they would have the knowledge it should work fairly easy on other computers running roughly the same operating system.<br /><br />The Raspberry Pi is attempting to invoke the feeling of the BBC Micro in an attempt to get kids programming again, because in the near future we are going to be in a very precarious situation with our engineering ability in this country.<br /><br />First of all why did the BBC Micro succeed? It is very hard to compare to today with the abundance of computing hardware just in your pocket.&nbsp; Part of it was almost every classroom across the land had one of these and the children who could work out how to operate them hunted 1s and 0s in packs.&nbsp; There was a communal aspect to it as the children would have to share, listen, and take it in turns.&nbsp; Also, there was the TV programme <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Live">Micro Live</a>, which was needed to get a chunk of publicity.<br /><br />My first programming was done on BBC Micros at school in the East End of London and at friends houses as we couldn&#8217;t afford one at home. So, I for one know their importance and probably a majority of my friends and colleagues had similar start.<br /><br />When I was at University Linux was just starting to gain some traction and the work of the FSF got us GCC and the mix of other tools.&nbsp; But on Windows I was still trying to use DJGPP and there was no chance of getting more complex things working with an open (free and Free) toolchain.&nbsp; Children coming up in that age must consider it the computing Dark Ages.<br /><br />So I come back to my first statement that cheap hardware has never been the problem.&nbsp; The people getting excited about it are 30+ developers like me who think - &#8220;Oooooh, cheap commodity ARM platform, that I can hack in lots of ways&#8221;.&nbsp; My immediate thought was to make it into an immensely cheap network connected digital signage system.&nbsp; And this is probably because ARM is still a minefield and a static and well supported platform would be desirable.<br /><br />I am not trying to negate the good work done by Raspberry Pi as it could be amazing if it is the Trojan Horse.&nbsp; What do I mean by that?&nbsp; The hardware becomes the makeweight for all the real important stuff that needs to happen if we are truly going to educate the next generation of programmers.<br /><br />What is needed?&nbsp; Community, publicity, documentation and traction.&nbsp; Community because this goes beyond the single classroom of my youth.&nbsp; You need IRC, social networking and tools for more permanent sharing (like <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>).&nbsp; This then ties into documentation, it would need to be good up front but also allow for the people to evolve it, so much like a wiki.<br /><br />Just social media publicity would not be enough, you would really need a TV programme to generate it, but then this is where the social media would tie in.&nbsp; For the programme they would have to show the users best contributions so there is an incentive to produce and produce something good.&nbsp; After all how many people sent a picture into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartbeat">Hartbeat</a> in the hope of getting into the gallery? It&#8217;s the closest computing could get to the X-Factor&#8230;<br /><br />The most important part will always be changing the educational system to get children learning how computers to make computers work for them rather than simply going through the commercial Word Processor/Spreadsheet operating.&nbsp; I suppose this is where the documentation does come in, but I think there will need to be more.&nbsp; If someone could show educators a curriculum that they could prove worked then that might get the traction required.&nbsp; That would be a tough proposition and also I am unsure about whether there are enough technical skills in the educational sector to deploy such a thing.&nbsp; Maybe it would require people from industry coming in and mentoring&#8230; <br /><br />In the end I am hoping that the Raspberry Pi hardware is the Trojan Horse for something much more fundamental.</div>
