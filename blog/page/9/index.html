<div class="post-content"><p>I spent over seven years working in the CAD/CAM industry. It&#8217;s a very archaic industry with virtually no open-source building blocks available, and those that are tend be be extremely old or not even useful.</p>

<p>There are a few green shoots of open-source out there. First up there is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wildcat-cad/">wildcat-cad</a> which is an attempt to create an open-source 3D solid modelling kernel and associated tools.</p>

<p>There is also <a href="http://code.google.com/p/heekscad/">heekscad</a> which is a modelling program using the <a href="http://www.opencascade.org/">OpenCascade</a> solid modelling kernel (GPL licensed I believe). There is also a CAM add-on for heekscad called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/">heekscnc</a> with a lot of associated libraries providing some good functionality.</p>

<p>An additional program is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/voxelcut/">voxelcut</a> which allows for a solid machining simulation to see what damage you&#8217;ll do to your hardened steel.</p>

<p>One of the libraries is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/libarea/">libarea</a> which is for area-clearance algorithms in CAM. This is normally one of the most closely guarded secrets in commercial CAD/CAM so it is interesting to see an open implementation.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/libactp/">libactp</a> is an adaptive clearance toolpath which originated from <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk">Freesteel</a>. They&#8217;ve got it integrated into heekscnc so you can try it out for yourself.</p>

<p>You can keep track of a lot of this stuff through <a href="http://heekscnc.blogspot.com/">Dan Heek&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>

<p>Another unrelated program is <monocam> which uses C-sharp as a development language and has soem interesting algorithms like the drop cutter which provides the basis for most 3D machining algorithms.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I decided it was time for a new look so I grabbed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/inove">iNove</a> theme for WordPress. I&#8217;ve made a few minor hacks for it which I will publish in due course (although I&#8217;ve got no idea what license these themes are available under. The changes I&#8217;ve made are the code tag now using different formatting, different font for the title, and making the hover on the subscribe link show the number of subscribers on Feedburner.</p>

<p>The website for the guy that supplied this theme is <a href="http://www.neoease.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also now installed <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-codebox/">WP-Codebox</a> to make posting code much easier and configurable.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>The developers here at <a href="http://www.camvine.com">Camvine</a> have held on to the <a href="http://twitter.com/camvine">Camvine Twitter Feed</a> for two weeks now with ten examples of cool uses of the <a href="http://camvine.com/products/coda">CODA digital signage system</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a run-down of the ten so far:</p>

<h1>1 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/Q0Zq">Get live updates from your Twitter feed displayed on the wall!</a></h1>

<h1>2 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/xHU0e">Get up-to-date feeds from popular photo sharing sites on your wall by using photocasts!</a></h1>

<h1>4 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/m6vOc">Get calendars out of the computer and to where they can be seen and matter.</a></h1>

<h1>5 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/4vgVvo">For very busy people &#8211; put your inbox status on a display in your office!</a></h1>

<h1>6 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/11yca">Email your wall &#8211; a quick way for getting messages to all!</a></h1>

<h1>7 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/og5T">Keep abreast of what&#8217;s going on with RSS feeds in CODA!</a></h1>

<h1>9 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/VIgH0">Themed random photo mosaics using Flickr tags to generate art on your screens.</a></h1>

<h1>10 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/NV3O4">Monitor your website&#8217;s readership stats in real time via Feedburner and CODA!</a></h1>

<p>There are a number of interesting bits of source code to come out of this which I&#8217;ll cover in my next post.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>For the CODA app <a href="http://camvine.com/products/coda/support/hints/using-coda-track-your-websites-performance-feedburner">Using CODA to track your website&#8217;s performance with FeedBurner</a> I knocked up some code which gets your <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">Feedburner</a> statistics through the Awareness API with a simple bit of PHP.</p>

<p>Since the migration of Feedburner to Google&#8217;s Adwords for Feeds is in full swing I found I had to make sure I supported both methods. So the most interesting <a href="http://camvine.com/files/feedburner.php_.txt">piece of information in this MIT Licensed piece of code</a> is the retrieving of statistics from the API (which is still available after the Google migration). I&#8217;m not a PHP expert or anything (in fact it was my first bit of PHP I have ever written from scratch).</p>

<p>Here is the code which does the Feedburner API retrieval into some PHP variables:</p>

<pre lang="PHP" line="1" file="feedburner.php" colla="+"><?
// Get the blog type because some are still hosted on Feedburner whilst others
// are migrated to Google.
// Options are: "google" and "feedburner"
$blogtype = $_GET["type"];
// Get the blog name for the Feeedburner API.
$blogname = $_GET["blogname"];
// We default to Feedburner if the "type" parameter does not exist.
$base_url = "http://api.feedburner.com/awareness/1.0/GetFeedData?uri=";
if ($blogtype == "google")
    $base_url = "https://feedburner.google.com/api/awareness/1.0/GetFeedData?uri=";
// Query the Feedburner API and parse the statistics.
$xml = simplexml_load_file($base_url . $blogname) or die ("Unable to load XML file!");
$subs = $xml->feed->entry['circulation'];
$hits = $xml->feed->entry['hits'];
$reach = $xml->feed->entry['reach'];
?>

<p>But within there is a little bit of code we call <a href="http://github.com/mdales/codaflickrtags/blob/33b9135d9e68a29a20da6fc85c462f43678e0bc4/feedbutcher.py">FeedButcher</a> which is a very simple piece of Python code which carves up feeds.

<div class="post-content"><p>It&#8217;s nearly that time of month again (Is it really 2009? Is it really February?) for a <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">BCS SPA Computing Talk</a>. This month the talk will be about Agile.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/APracticalGuidetoWorkingwithCustomersonAgileProjects">Programmers are from Mars, Customers are from Venus: A Practical Guide to Working with Customers on Agile Projects </a><br/>
<a href="http://www.martinitconsulting.com/agile/home.html">Angela Martin</a></p>

<p><strong>February 11th 2009, 7:00pm (light buffet) 7:30pm (talk)</strong><br/>
Venue: <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge">Microsoft Research Centre Cambridge</a></p>

<p>Customers have one of the most complex and difficult roles on a project, yet XP and Scrum include very few practices that support the Customer in their role. Over the last five years, we have investigated many projects around the world to identify how Customers succeed in this complex and difficult task â€” discovering not what people think should have happened, but what really happened and what actually worked! By the end of this talk you will have gained:</p>

<ul>
<li>A realistic understanding of the complexity and difficulty of the Customer role.</li>
<li>An understanding of the key roles required on the Customer team, both what they are and why they matter.</li>
<li>An understanding of the eight practices that enable Customers to sustainably drive Agile projects to successful completion.</li>
</ul>
