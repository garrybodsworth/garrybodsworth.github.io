<div class="post-content"><p>I decided it was time for a new look so I grabbed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/inove">iNove</a> theme for WordPress. I&#8217;ve made a few minor hacks for it which I will publish in due course (although I&#8217;ve got no idea what license these themes are available under. The changes I&#8217;ve made are the code tag now using different formatting, different font for the title, and making the hover on the subscribe link show the number of subscribers on Feedburner.</p>

<p>The website for the guy that supplied this theme is <a href="http://www.neoease.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also now installed <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-codebox/">WP-Codebox</a> to make posting code much easier and configurable.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>The developers here at <a href="http://www.camvine.com">Camvine</a> have held on to the <a href="http://twitter.com/camvine">Camvine Twitter Feed</a> for two weeks now with ten examples of cool uses of the <a href="http://camvine.com/products/coda">CODA digital signage system</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a run-down of the ten so far:</p>

<h1>1 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/Q0Zq">Get live updates from your Twitter feed displayed on the wall!</a></h1>

<h1>2 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/xHU0e">Get up-to-date feeds from popular photo sharing sites on your wall by using photocasts!</a></h1>

<h1>4 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/m6vOc">Get calendars out of the computer and to where they can be seen and matter.</a></h1>

<h1>5 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/4vgVvo">For very busy people &#8211; put your inbox status on a display in your office!</a></h1>

<h1>6 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/11yca">Email your wall &#8211; a quick way for getting messages to all!</a></h1>

<h1>7 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/og5T">Keep abreast of what&#8217;s going on with RSS feeds in CODA!</a></h1>

<h1>10 &#8211; <a href="http://bit.ly/NV3O4">Monitor your website&#8217;s readership stats in real time via Feedburner and CODA!</a></h1>

<div class="post-content"><p>For the CODA app <a href="http://camvine.com/products/coda/support/hints/using-coda-track-your-websites-performance-feedburner">Using CODA to track your website&#8217;s performance with FeedBurner</a> I knocked up some code which gets your <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">Feedburner</a> statistics through the Awareness API with a simple bit of PHP.</p>

<p>Since the migration of Feedburner to Google&#8217;s Adwords for Feeds is in full swing I found I had to make sure I supported both methods. So the most interesting <a href="http://camvine.com/files/feedburner.php_.txt">piece of information in this MIT Licensed piece of code</a> is the retrieving of statistics from the API (which is still available after the Google migration). I&#8217;m not a PHP expert or anything (in fact it was my first bit of PHP I have ever written from scratch).</p>

<p>Here is the code which does the Feedburner API retrieval into some PHP variables:</p>

<pre lang="PHP" line="1" file="feedburner.php" colla="+"><?
// Get the blog type because some are still hosted on Feedburner whilst others
// are migrated to Google.
// Options are: "google" and "feedburner"
$blogtype = $_GET["type"];
// Get the blog name for the Feeedburner API.
$blogname = $_GET["blogname"];
// We default to Feedburner if the "type" parameter does not exist.
$base_url = "http://api.feedburner.com/awareness/1.0/GetFeedData?uri=";
if ($blogtype == "google")
    $base_url = "https://feedburner.google.com/api/awareness/1.0/GetFeedData?uri=";
// Query the Feedburner API and parse the statistics.
$xml = simplexml_load_file($base_url . $blogname) or die ("Unable to load XML file!");
$subs = $xml->feed->entry['circulation'];
$hits = $xml->feed->entry['hits'];
$reach = $xml->feed->entry['reach'];
?>
</pre>

<p>But within there is a little bit of code we call <a href="http://github.com/mdales/codaflickrtags/blob/33b9135d9e68a29a20da6fc85c462f43678e0bc4/feedbutcher.py">FeedButcher</a> which is a very simple piece of Python code which carves up feeds. We needed it to get pictures out of feeds for our Flickr app.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s released under MIT license so if anyone else can find a use for it/improve it &#8211; have fun.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/APracticalGuidetoWorkingwithCustomersonAgileProjects">Programmers are from Mars, Customers are from Venus: A Practical Guide to Working with Customers on Agile Projects </a><br/>
<a href="http://www.martinitconsulting.com/agile/home.html">Angela Martin</a></p>

<p><strong>February 11th 2009, 7:00pm (light buffet) 7:30pm (talk)</strong><br/>
Venue: <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge">Microsoft Research Centre Cambridge</a></p>

<p>Customers have one of the most complex and difficult roles on a project, yet XP and Scrum include very few practices that support the Customer in their role. Over the last five years, we have investigated many projects around the world to identify how Customers succeed in this complex and difficult task — discovering not what people think should have happened, but what really happened and what actually worked! By the end of this talk you will have gained:</p>

<ul>
<li>A realistic understanding of the complexity and difficulty of the Customer role.</li>
<li>An understanding of the key roles required on the Customer team, both what they are and why they matter.</li>
<li>An understanding of the eight practices that enable Customers to sustainably drive Agile projects to successful completion.</li>
</ul>

<div class="post-content"><p>A little while ago I <a href="http://blog.programmerslog.com/?p=274">posted</a> about having problems getting my nVidia GeForce 6600GT AGP working on Ubuntu. I tried everything that a sane person would and then some. I tried Nouveau, Ubuntu&#8217;s various versions in their repository, and the ones direct from nVidia. The closest I had to working was the beta 1.80 which kept crashing&#8230; When 1.80 was officially released I tried that and that did not work at all with a completely black screen (like the other official version I tried).</p>

<p>Anyway, my solution was to order from Play an <a href="http://www.play.com/PC/PCs/4-/7871884/Play-Value-ATI-Radeon-HD-2600-Pro-512MB-PCI-E-Graphics-Card/Product.html?cm_mmc=Froogle-_-PC-_-Components-_-Play%2BValue%2BATI%2BRadeon%2BHD%2B2600%2BPro%2B%2F%2B512MB%2B%2F%2BPCI-E%2B%2F%2BGraphics%2BCard&amp;source=5066&amp;engine=froogle_pc&amp;keyword=Play+Value+ATI+Radeon+HD+2600+Pro+%2F+512MB+%2F+PCI-E+%2F+Graphics+Card">ATi HD2600 Pro</a> for £30. It&#8217;s even got 512Meg on board which is a huge amount of memory. The main reason for this was an eye on the future for proper open-source support, that although is not currently comprehensive will improve in the future.</p>

<p>So I plugged the card in after cleaning out all remnants of all nVidia drivers, rebooted and it worked straight away. I enabled the closed-source ATi drivers and got all eye candy working as well. Ultimately I will use the RadeonHD driver that is open source in XOrg repositories, but it isn&#8217;t quite complete. You can also keep track of available features in a handy table <a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now I am happily able to use Ubuntu at 1920&#215;1200 with useful 3D features like Expose and desktop expose.</p>
