<div class="post-content"><p>There is a good post called <a href="http://blog.ibeentoubuntu.com/2008/08/appliancising-of-free-software.html">The &#8220;Appliancising&#8221; of Free Software</a> which talks about how free software is helping to make appliances of computing equipment and the diversification of the &#8220;standard&#8221; software. Perhaps not the best description but the post itself brought up some interesting points.</p>

<p>The way I see it is that the loudest complainers (who probably don&#8217;t even use free software) complain that there is too much choice in free software. Basically when you create a computer &#8220;appliance&#8221; you would use some custom software set up especially for that device. It is likely you would start with something like Debian or Gentoo and then customise it for your own needs.</p>

<p>Even writing commercial software the same thing occurs. I have seen the same product rebranded for not only different markets but for different resellers and agents. Then they all want their own customisations to differentiate from what is essentially the same software.</p>

<p>Doing the same type of thing with Windows is just insane. For a start you can&#8217;t really configure the system without undocumented things and jumping through many hoops, even Media Centers are pretty much equivalent editions possibly with some changed logo graphics with only the hardware providing the differentiating factor.</p>

<p>Also doing the same thing from scratch is brain-damaged. Reinventing the wheel for little or no benefit will just lead to maintenance headaches. As a developer I am fundamentally lazy and will reuse what I can because it is great to stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to this future of diversity because one-size-fits-all doesn&#8217;t work and could supply better to tested and built systems that actually do what they say.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>So I&#8217;ve been writing in Python as part of my job for a month now&#8230; I am still writing using a text editor and running stuff on the command line (after dabbling in Eclipse and other Python editors). I can see why people like Python so much, it has some cool stuff.</p>

<p>What I discovered this week was the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-Queue.html">Queue</a> object in Python. It is a thread-safe FIFO queue and it is there and ready to use. In C++ I would probably have found the definitive implementation through some library (hopefully in <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a>) or I would have to roll my own with all the headaches involved in making sure just the building blocks work correctly. I&#8217;m not using it in the way that most people would expect but that is the great part of supplying solidly tested building blocks.</p>

<p>As usual the code I am writing needed unit-testing to make sure it did what it says on the tin. This meant a multi-threaded unit-test &#8211; I know this is a <a href="http://goodliffe.blogspot.com/2008/06/unit-testing-threads-is-hard-part-4.html">bad thing sometimes</a>. I had to thrash it with the mountain of threads but the tests seem to work consistently (although I imagine it could turn up to bite me in the future). I am sure three-quarters of the code I have been writing are unit tests.</p>

<p>Some other great parts of Python I found is the function is a first class object, and I&#8217;ve even played a little with lambdas. I&#8217;m looking forward to investigating where the best place is to put the boundaries between C++ and Python code.</p>

<p>At the moment I am really at the tip of the iceberg stage, there is the 75% that isn&#8217;t so obviously on display.</p>

<time datetime="2008-08-20T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 20<span>th</span>, 2008</time>
</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been writing Python professionally for about a month and I am still in the process of shaking out my C++isms. This is not a diatribe about how C++ is rubbish, because I think C++ is great. I am making some &#8220;mistakes&#8221; as I am in the learning process.</p>

<p>So today I was writing a function to parse a URL into the useful parts that make it up. I&#8217;d laid it out all nicely, written some unit-tests and it did its job exactly how I wanted. Then I was asked did the Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-urlparse.html">urlparse</a> module not do what I wanted. Damn &#8211; as a C++ developer I&#8217;m used to rolling a lot of stuff that make up the building blocks of the software, so what I did was pretty natural. What I need to learn is to check the Python libraries first before doing obvious things.</p>

<p>The other thing I am rapidly unlearning is writing verbose loops. In C++ I am used to writing loops int he way I am expecting them to be executed. In Python you need to express them differently using list comprehension, which I am liking a lot. I even rewrote some loops today I wrote in my first week where I replaced seven lines with one that expressed the intent of the statement perfectly.</p>

<p>Another thing that weirded me out was creating threads. You create the variables for them, start them off and they know when to clean themselves up&#8230; I think it is because I am still thinking about the C++ scoping rules rather than garbage collecting.</p>

<p>I am sure these Python-ing mistakes won&#8217;t be my last, but it is interesting to wrap your head around some new things. I do miss manually managing my memory and knowing when stuff gets destroyed, I think it probably is because I&#8217;m paranoid and need to relax and go with the flow.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>This post is otherwise known as &#8220;Why multiple monitor support in Windows sucks&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<p>Noah Coad, one of the Program Managers on the Visual Studio team blogged about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/noahc/archive/2007/10/10/multi-monitor-support-in-vs10.aspx">Multi Monitor Support in VS10</a> and it is confirmed on the <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=351965">Microsoft Connect site</a>. When I worked at <a href="http://displaylink.com">DisplayLink</a> we obviously used multiple monitors on Windows in development so any help in that regard is welcomed. When you use multiple monitors every day you do discover the deficiencies in the operation of such set-ups (even on the latest Windows Vista). Things like disappearing windows, incorrect sizing, incorrect windows flags (saying its maximised when it isn&#8217;t leading to all kinds of bizarre effects), losing display configurations, and the most important &#8211; that virtually all Windows applications are designed to be operated when the parent frame is full-screen.</p>

<p>These features that are being suggested should be in the operating system, not just support in certain applications that never even make it into the higher level APIs (how many implementations should there be of ribbon? one provided by the API). These features are also not just the realm of developers, I am sure artists, sound engineers and many other disciplines would like to see better multiple monitor support. Also, when it is in the operating system it is consistent across all applications rather than having similar or completely different behaviour between applications. The main problem with Windows in this regard is if there is a good feature that is applicable to more situations it never propagates up to the API level within the organisation.</p>

<p>By operating system I mean graphical user interface <img src='http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>
