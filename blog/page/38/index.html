Nope, I haven&#8217;t forgot how to type, but it is a new Java Library for game development.  It provides access to <a href="http://www.openal.org">OpenAL</a> and <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> through Java.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lwjgl.org/">LWJGL</a> is designed to allow commercial quality game development in Java and represents many years of development.  It&#8217;s not a game engine in itself but provides the framework to develop them easily on Java.  It is designed to work on anything with a JVM so it could be used in smartphones and the like.<br /><br />It&#8217;s interesting from the point of view that this would enable cross-platform development and hopefully give a platform like DirectX.</div>

The past week I have been compiling a list of free (open-source and closed-source) games available for Windows/Mac/Linux.  It is amazing how much there is out there, so I&#8217;ll probably have to divide it up into multiple posts.<br /><br />There are lots of good quality open-source projects, which makes for lots of source code to eyeball which is really quite cool.<br /><br />But before I start down that road, there is a great blog called <a href="http://indygamer.blogspot.com/">Independent Gaming</a> which has great indy, freeware and open-source games.  The coverage is really comprehensive an has plenty of great reviews.</div>

With my problems with Vista I have to wonder when the world will grind to a halt.  I realise it is a very pessimistic view and I know it won&#8217;t happen, because it will probably just cause more hardware churn (the buying of new hardware).  Those that know what they are doing with computers though will still plough their own furrow with well designed solutions.<br /><br />The problem I am getting to though is Visual Studio 2005.  Initially we were really impressed with it, you can look inside of arrays and it allowed settings to be exported and automated.  Unfortunately months down the line I think it must suffer from digital entropy.  The .vssettings files seem to rarely work now even though there is nothing to suggest why the settings will not take.  The bscmake.exe continually fails, sometimes with an out of memory exception.  The incremental linking can sometimes  take over 20 minutes for a simple one file change.  The STL is simply too slow if you rely on the speed of the STL operation.  The Intellisense update can cause the UI to freeze up and it rarely builds the symbols correctly meaning you can be left with no tooltips.  VS2005 uses masses more memory and gradually slows down.<br /><br />The thing was when we installed it, there was definitely a lot of bonuses, but after having to use it for a few months it becomes incredibly difficult to defend it.  I think the IDE is now geared towards CLI/.NET development so it probably works seamlessly for that, but for C++ only it seems to be lacking and going backwards in some instances by forcing some &#8220;secure&#8221; programming on you.<br /><br />Unfortunately it is still the best IDE for developing on Windows and there is very little to touch it.  Maybe in the future something like <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org">Code::Blocks</a> or <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> could catch it, but it will probably always be ahead.</div>

<a href="http://www.cegui.org.uk">CEGUI or Crazy Eddie&#8217;s GUI System</a> is not a typical GUI toolkit.  It is designed primarily for gamers to embed a GUI interface into graphics windows (normally in order to use this they would be fullscreen or you would use the platform toolkit).<br /><br />The GUI toolkit itself has backends for DirectX 8.1 & 9, <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a>, <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">OGRE</a> and <a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/">Irrlicht</a>.  This allows you to then overlay GUI elements into your program window.  The advantage of being self-rendering is that it is then cross platform.  Currently it supports Linux and Windows and Mac OSX support is on its way.  The nature of the renderer backend means it would be trivial to use it in something like <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org">OpenSceneGraph</a>.<br /><br />With the theming ability of the engine it is possible to use this toolkit as your start screen menus for games or even more.<br /><br />The toolkit itself is written in object-oriented C++ and looks really quite clean from the examples.  For its niche it really doesn&#8217;t have masses of competition, but it does not preclude it from being and impressive solution.</div>

Vista is released to consumers tomorrow&#8230;<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been using Vista for two months now and it has been nothing but a pain.  It has actually slowed my rate of work by virtue of being slow, unresponsive, and needlessly verbose.<br /><br />Today I ran a <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> script which created some text files.  Now I can&#8217;t get the permissions on the directories will not allow me to remove them, it sends me through numerous UAC dialogs asking for permission and then it throws up an error message with a cryptic hex value.  Even editing file and directory permissions fails to alleviate the problem.<br /><br />It&#8217;s not just a new problem encountered day to day, it is a problem that slows you down.  Installing and executing software is massively slower, I guess due to some security changes.  It is all the small things that add up to a big annoyance as there is not one thing that is excessively bad (although UAC is close to that).<br /><br />The best problem I have on Windows Vista is that I can&#8217;t reboot because it breaks my C++ compilation in Visual Studio 2005.  Sounds mad, but it is completely true, the precompiled header or something causes an internal compiler error when trying an incremental build even just changing a single .CPP file.  Unfortunately I can find no relevant documentation on this problem.</div>

Today I have had the pleasure of working on a 23 inch Apple Cinema display.  It runs at a lovely 1920x1200 resolution - that is a lot of desktop real estate.  The reason I wanted a larger monitor more than a new computer was that I was struggling to use the smaller monitor for all my work.<br /><br />The sacrilege I am bestowing upon this beautiful piece of hardware is that I have to work on Windows (and more specifically the beast that is Vista).  What this showed me is Windows is rubbish for working on large monitors in any meaningful way.<br /><br />The problems?  Simply most software designed for Windows is designed to work in full screen mode (and much of the development tools encourage this).  In most instances this is complete rubbish when you are working on a large monitor.  Even the two monitor configuration encourages you to still work with each screen using full screen apps.<br /><br />The main problem is that the window handling and the taskbar itself just isn&#8217;t up to the job of context switching.  This is partially because MDI interfaces (either traditional or tabbed) are controlled by the application not the OS.  The actual windows are also not broken down into functional elements.  Even editing in Word encourages you to use fullscreen.<br /><br />From the demo I had of Mac OSX it deals with multiple windows much better, also all the time I used Linux (KDE and Gnome) it felt like it was geared for large screen use.  It is partially the reason that <a href="http://www.gimp.org">GIMP</a> works much better on Linux than it does in Windows and people using Windows have immese problems with the UI.<br /><br />If large screen computers somehow become the norm I think that Windows will need to come up with a more intelligent way for the user to use the space.  At the moment the resolutions we have are great, but having a more sharply rendered image is of less benefit than using the extra space more efficiently.</div>
