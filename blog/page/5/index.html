<div class="post-content"><p>Great news today, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/google-io-2010-day-1-more-powerful-web.html">Google are open-sourcing and more importantly free patent licensing</a> the VP8 codec. As part of this they are creating the <a href="http://www.webmproject.org/">WebM</a> project with a new container format that uses the open-source <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">Vorbis</a> audio codec.</p>

<p>As someone who has to deal with video codecs every day and the horrors they induce (not just from a technical standpoint but legal) this is a very good thing. Unfortunately it does have some way to go to depose the incumbent codecs, and to reach parity with respect to hardware acceleration, but I am sure it will happen swifter than we can imagine. The main reasons for this is that Youtube will be using it which is a large portion of the web&#8217;s video, and th enames that are all on board to support it in both software and hardware.</p>

<p>I can tell you as soon as gstreamer gets support <a href="http://www.camvine.com">CODA</a> will be getting WebM.</p>

<p>There is also now a technical analysis from an x264 developer which can be read <a href="http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=377">here</a>.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>At <a href="http://www.camvine.com/products/hardware">Camvine</a> I spent a small amount of time recently making sure <a href="http://typekit.com/">TypeKit</a> works, so we can use funky fonts in our <a href="http://webkit.org/">WebKit</a> based browser.</p>

<p>Now Google have announced the <a href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/05/introducing-google-font-api-google-font.html">Google Web Font API and the Google Web Font Directory</a>. The API webpage is <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/">here</a>.</p>

<p>You can view the available fonts <a href="http://code.google.com/webfonts">here</a>. Not a huge amount or anything but f it catches on it could explode very quickly.</p>

<p>What with Google pushing 3D web, video, geolocation, fonts, app store, online collaboration (opening up Wave to all), and god knows what else I think they are heading towards completely closing the loop functionality-wise. As far as I can tell you can actually make commercial use of some of these APIs now whereas you were completely unable to do so legally before.</p>

      <a href="/blog/2010/05/16/ipad-accessibility/">iPad Accessibility</a>
    </h1>
  
  








  


<time datetime="2010-05-16T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 16<span>th</span>, 2010</time>
</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>So I took the company iPad on a weekend holiday to my parent&#8217;s house. My ulterior motive was to find out whether it really was accessible, and by that I mean for people with audio and visual impairment.</p>

<p>My mother is registered as deafblind (contrary to what spell checkers will tell you it is all one word), this does not mean she is completely devoid of sight but it she has an extremely limited field of vision (for the specifics it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usher_syndrome">Usher Type 2</a> Retinitis Pigmentosa). Currently she uses a standard Windows PC with minimal changes from the default settings. There is also a big monitor, which is actually more of a detriment to someone who cannot see all of the monitor at once.</p>

<p>The first plus for her was the form factor. Most people moan it&#8217;s too small or it isn&#8217;t widescreen, but this was an item that could be viewed as a whole even taking into account a limited field of vision.</p>

<p>Most people say touchscreens don&#8217;t work because of the lack of tactile feedback which some have said is required for blind people. This depends on your definition of blind, a person completely devoid of sight is actually a rare occurrence, most people who are registered blind have some degree of sight left and know how to make the most of it. She was able to type with ease on the keyboard. The limitations of the keyboard however though were the inability to set the contrast settings for it independently of the rest of the system (white on black is normally the choice for people with visual impairment). Also it would have been good if important items were highlighted in some way like &#8220;Go&#8221; or &#8220;Search&#8221; because otherwise you end up searching on the keyboard.</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of a touchscreen is that it is not necessary for the cursor to be large, and also with visual impairment time is spent trying to find the cursor on the screen which is difficult with a large surface area.</p>

<p>The quality of the screen and its contrast was extremely good for someone with visual impairments. Clarity of viewing and also the viewing angles are extremely important in that respect.</p>

<p>And I haven&#8217;t even got to the specific accessibility features available on the iPad which frankly knocks any competing product for six. You have the ability to view white on black, but this does a complete inversion meaning it looks like you are looking at a negative, but it&#8217;s better than nothing.</p>

<p>The text-to-speech features are excellent with the quality of playback being listenable rather than annoying. You can use this on the ebooks, websites, the user interface. It does mean navigation is slightly more complex but being patient helps because the speech also gives you hints as to the action to perform next.</p>

<p>You also have the ability to switch the sound to mono, which will have every techie screaming, but it is very important for any auditory problems because then you get the same sound into both ears.</p>

<p>The ability to zoom in on pages is taken for granted by most phone users nowadays but this is another invaluable feature, and the ability to configure text size in iBooks is also as valuable.</p>

<p>Also the screen size would be great if only iPlayer worked on it yet (I realise we have a pre-ash cloud import so the official UK release is a little while away) with subtitles. In fact the content delivery would be extremely important, and I hope that providers will supply subtitles for their offerings.</p>

<p>With all the accessibility features it got me thinking that when it gets even more integrated you are talking about turn-by-turn navigation and general independence help thanks to location based APIs. A map would be a nightmare for someone with a narrow field of vision.</p>

<p>The most important aspect of all of this is that it is so well thought out and intuitive to use. It all clearly integrates with the system and creates a simple to use environment. The quality of the engineered components is second to none matching the quality of the software that will no doubt improve with subsequent revisions. As a developer I dread lock-in but there are simply no alternatives that are within five years of being close to competing, it does revolutionise computing for a swathe of the population.</p>

<p>When I saw how much the iPad was going to be in the UK I thought it was too rich for my blood and I would put off buying one for myself. But now I see how much it will be liberating for people with sensory impairment when configured correctly I have to put my thinking cap on again.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>After the great games for Linux made easily available in the <a href="http://www.wolfire.com/humble">Humble Games Bundle</a>, games for Linux are definitely looking up.</p>

<p>The good news today is that there has been an announcement in amongst the Mac articles that soon there will be a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/7715209/Steam-for-Mac-goes-live.html">Steam client for Linux</a>. A more in-depth article on Phoronix <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=valve_steam_announcement&amp;num=1%22">here</a>.</p>

<p>If this works well on the nVidia 9400M (the ION platform) then it would be really interesting to see what this does for ION nettops. In theory for about £150 you could have a fully functioning Linux computer with gaming prowess (although obviously most people would prefer consoles for this).</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Video acceleration has got a whole lot better on Linux. <a href="http://www.splitted-desktop.com/en/">Splitted Desktop</a> have released gstreamer plugins with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Acceleration_API">VA-API</a> support. gstreamer-vaapi was announced on the gstreamer-devel list <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=alpine.DEB.1.10.1005101402160.21123%40thalys.splitted-desktop.com&amp;forum_name=gstreamer-devel">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are VA-API backends (in the project <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libva/">libva</a>) for Intel chips, VDPAU for nvidia (and allegedly S3) chips and XvBA for AMD chips (have they ever officially released it?) So this acceleration framework will work on tons of hardware out there. Except for the Intel open-source drivers you do need to use the binary closed source drivers (also for Intel Poulsbo).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.splitted-desktop.com/~gbeauchesne/gstreamer-vaapi/">gstreamer-vaapi</a> plugin supplies MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, VC-1, WMV3 acceleration (providing your hardware supports it). Also output is on OpenGL rendering through VA/GLX or GLX texture-from-pixmap + FBO.</p>

<p>Being gstreamer it should be relatively swift for many applications to pick up the acceleration.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>So after all the issues I was having with WebKitGTK having undebuggable crashes somewhere in the nvidia binary blob I decided to have a go at QtWebKit integration. It was fairly quick and easy to do (I cheated and used <a href="http://www.pyside.org/">PySide</a> for brevity). That was good &#8211; no crashes, some nice looking fonts, Flash working and generally all was good, so I started to think how to do a proper integration.</p>

<p>This is where it all goes wrong. I find with most things an initial test implementation is quick and gives you a feel for the problem, when you actually have to do the real thing you discover all kinds of creepy crawlies hiding under rocks. QtWebKit has now split out from Qt, but there is no packaging for this new branch that I could find under Ubuntu, not too much of an issue since I am used to packaging stuff up. I found HTML5 playback with the gstreamer Phonon backend simply did not work in any half decent fasion and they were concentrating on QtMultimedia which unfortunately is part of the development release.</p>

<p>The deal breaker was the speed of CSS animations, which I am lucky I actually got around to checking since I was juggling so many variables. It was unfeasibly slow. So I decided to use the new QtWebKit 2.0 as it contains compositing acceleration support for just this problem. Indeed, using raster or opengl graphics backends did speed up the animation to very smooth. What I then discovered was I could have smooth animations and no working Flash or rough animations and a kind of working Flash.</p>

<p>This was all most depressing, so I have gone back to WebkitGTK. It is only this crash issue I have to get to the bottom of but it only shows itself in one of my tests which is very specific, and I am thinking it is related to the way xlib is working in the nvidia driver. I do prefer GTK to Qt, so that is also good for me! I would have given EFL Webkit a go, but unfortunately they seem to have removed features in getting the functionality into the Webkit trunk.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Just made my order for the <a href="http://www.wolfire.com/humble">Humble Indie Games Pack</a>. This is a set of indie games that are up for sale at any price you want to pay with your choice as to how much goes to charity and how much goes to the developers. It looks like they have raised a lot of money for good causes (indie game developers deserve it was well).</p>

<p>All the games work on Windows, Mac and Linux (woohoo!) They are all DRM free and you can install them and run them how you want. The games are <a href="http://2dboy.com/games.php">World Of Goo</a>, <a href="http://www.crypticsea.com/gish/">Gish</a>, <a href="http://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria/">Aquaria</a>, <a href="http://www.wolfire.com/lugaru">Lugaru</a>, and <a href="http://www.penumbragame.com/ageGate.php">Penumbra</a>.</p>

<p>Time to go and install them on the wife&#8217;s Linux netbook &#8211; after all you always need more games on Linux.</p>
