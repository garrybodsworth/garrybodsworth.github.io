My day job is spent writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing">CAM software</a>.  There is a great little hacking site called <a href="http://www.hackaday.com">Hackaday</a>.  Those two sentences may look completely unrelated but it has some great articles about making your own tools (CNC machines) to do machining.<br /><br />Here is a list of CAM related articles:<br /><a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2006/07/12/how-to-build-your-own-cnc-mill/">How to build your own CNC mill</a><br /><a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2006/11/12/make-a-badass-cnc-mill/">Make a badass CNC mill</a><br /><a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2006/12/08/fab-home/">Fab@Home</a><br /><a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2007/01/01/snowboard-cnc-machine/">Snowboard CNC machine</a><br /><br />Fab@home looks really interesting as it is open-source and it is planned to manufacture itself.</div>

If you find fab@home impressive you might also want to take at look at the RepRap project out of the University of Bath in the UK&#8230;<br /><br />http://reprap.org<br /><br />Their soon-to-be released machine is also open source, has a proper plastics extruder presently qualified for polycapralactone which can make usuable, hard objects.  Whereas the fab@home machine costs $2,400 for parts, the RepRap Darwin is on track to cost no more than $400. <br /><br />A spinoff of the RepRap project, Tommelise, is focussed on the American parts environment and uses somewhat different technology and a different control strategy.  It&#8217;s also an open source specification will let anybody with a few hand tools and primitive woodworking skills bootstrap themselves into 3D fabrication for about $150. Tommelise&#8217;s extruder is qualified for polycapralactone and is presently being qualified as well for both high density polypropylene (HDPE, the stuff your plastic cutting board is made of) and polypropylene (HPP, the stuff your coffee maker and plastic electric kettle is made of).  You can keep an eye on the Tommelise project at&#8230;<br /><br />http://3dReplicators.com<br /><br />Have fun!</div>

Recently there has been a wealth of information about <a href="http://wiki.kde.org/tiki-index.php?page=KDE4">KDE4</a> which is going to be the new version based on <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/whatsnew">Qt4</a> with loads of new technologies.  I thought I&#8217;d put all of the recent good links into one handy place.<br /><br />KDE in Suse Linux 10.2 is reviewed <a href="http://blogbeebe.blogspot.com/2006/12/suse-102-part-3-looking-at-kde.html">here</a>.  It has some really impressive screenshots of version 3.5 which doesn&#8217;t even have the splendid new features.  It features the new start menu type thing called <a href="http://home.kde.org/~binner/kickoff/sneak_preview.html">Kickoff</a>, check out the link to see it animated.<br /><br />Bizarrely what kicked off this wealth of information about the progress of KDE4 was someone making a blog post saying there was no progress and no future progress in desktop Linux.  It was completely misguided, but it started an avalanche waking up a dozing beast, one of the KDE developers made this <a href="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2006/12/website-does-not-make-you-smart.html">post</a>.<br /><br />A list of features targeted at KDE4 can be viewed <a href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2007/01/sneek-preview-of-expected-features-in.html">here</a>.<br /><br />There is an article about the SVG rendering in applications <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1167723426/">here</a>.<br /><br />You can view an article about the KOffice 2.0 technologies <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1168284615/">here</a>.<br /><br />There is now a proper installer for running KDE on Windows seamlessly.  This is detailed in <a href="http://commit-digest.org/issues/2007-01-14/">this article</a>.  Also there is now KDE for Mac (so it integrates properly into OSX and not like those X11 applications).  There is some coverage of this <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1168899755/">here</a>.  Both of these are possible thanks to Qt being GPL on both platforms now at version 4.<br /><br />Finally there is an article about the new <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1169588301/">job progress user interface</a>.  It looks like it could be quite useful.<br /><br />Overall, exciting times are ahead for KDE and the Linux desktop.</div>

Just a short post to add some clarity to my <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/">previous post</a> on the subject of using STLPort with Visual Studio 2005 instead of the Microsoft STL implementation.<br /><br />The code used in my observations is a C++ MFC based application.  The STL used are mainly containers with virtually zero iostreams code (or at least so little it will not change the results).  The container usage are from very large long-lived containers through to many short lived small containers and everything inbetween.  Massive amounts of containers are created throughout the program lifetime.  Luckily most containers are created in thread local storage and gets freed when the thread has done its work.  The thread allocators use the allocator provided in STLPort.<br /><br />The difference in performance is marked for what is essentially lots of insertions into STL containers and lots of reads from them.  When we are talking about a 20% performance gain by using STLPort it is quite scary, but also means switching to Microsoft STL would be unacceptable to users because the slowdown would be so noticeable.</div>

<a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> is a great interpreted language for either scripting or proper applications, and I&#8217;ve mentioned it a few times in the past, it really is that good.<br /><br />I came across a great site about <a href="http://www.awaretek.com/toolkits.html">GUI kits for Python</a>.  It gives you suggestions based on your requirements by filling out a mini form.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python_gui/">PyGUI</a> - It is planned to be a cross platform GUI library implemented specially for Python.  Currently it has Mac OSX Cocoa and X11 using GTK implementations.<br /><br /><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter">Tkinter</a> - the default GUI installed with Python.  It provides a thin layer to Tcl/Tk.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a> - I have mentioned this a few times already.  It is the Python bindings for <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> making it cross-platform and with a great depth of features.  You can also use a Python written IDE and RAD GUI designer <a href="http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net/">BoaConstructor</a>.<br /><br />There are many more listed on the page covering the GUI designers as well as the toolkits.</div>

In the <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/01/mac-osx.html">previous post</a> I mentioned <a href="http://www.neooffice.org">NeoOffice</a> - the Mac-based version of <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a>.<br /><br />In the first quarter 2007 there are plans to release version 2.1.  This is going to integrate the changes from OpenOffice 2.0->2.1, which includes new scripting and lots of improvements.  Not only that it will also have support for Office 2007 documents, and execution of VBA scripts in Excel documents.<br /><br />Overall it looks like NeoOffice is pressing ahead with substantial improvements and features.  It&#8217;s good to see that Mac OSX has an accomplished office suite outside of Office for Mac.</div>

I&#8217;m depressed as today, I had an extended demo of a MacBook Pro.  One of the guys at work has just bought one, and now I want one&#8230;<br /><br />It is astonishing simply how good OSX is.  During the demo I saw how much it works like the way I want to use a computer.  When people who have used it say how good it is they are not exaggerating and don&#8217;t have an axe to grind, they just have a computer that makes their life easier.<br /><br />The thing I noticed most about it is that MDI is alive and well.  It&#8217;s not like the Windows MDI where the application encapsulates the sub projects, the operating system in OSX does the heavy lifting.  With this it also makes it much more structured and intuitive.  I can imagine working with loads of Photoshop documents and text documents at once and it all being being intuitive.  It is possible to see all the documents open at once with a zooming out style view, and it is also possible to see all the documents for a particular application.  It may not look as 3D <br /><br />Programs start very quickly and stay memory resident for fast access if necessary.  It is always clear what is going on and the user interface does is always responsive.<br /><br />All of this and I haven&#8217;t mentioned how good it looks.  It has lots of great touches in the UI but none of them take over or clutter the display.  Screenshots dn&#8217;t do it justice - you simply have to see it in the flesh.<br /><br />One great bit of software for OSX is <a href="http://www.neooffice.org/">NeoOffice</a> which is OpenOffice in Mac clothing.  It integrates really well into the way OSX works.  All developers involved deserve kudos for making OpenOffice into NeoOffice which I think is actually an improvement.<br /><br />One bit I wanted to see was X-Code for OSX development since I had heard so much about it.  Unfortunately it is not installed by default.<br /><br />Now I have to go off and save lots of money.</div>

An interesting development from <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> is that this April they are plaaning to release something called <a href="http://www.ubuntustudio.org">Ubuntu Studio</a>.<br /><br />It is a multimedia creation derivative of Ubuntu.  It &#8220;is aimed at the linux audio, video and graphic enthusiast as well as professional&#8221;.  Sounds interesting, lowering the bar for peopel creating content in Linux, but also raising the capabilities at the same time, hopefully giving much needed exposure to some of the related projects.<br /><br />The new derivative has a <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio">wiki</a> where information and planning has started.  I like the graphical design and new logo, but that is just shallow.  Packages planned to be in the distribution can be seen <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/ToPackage">here</a>.</div>

Vista has a new <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=196902178&cid=RSSfeed_TechWeb">Superprefetch feature</a> which is supposed to help launch applications faster because it is supposed to predict the future.<br /><br />Essentially it will give a perceived boost in performance to the user by predicting which applications may be run next and prepares for it.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t know really whether this is such a great idea - surely it would be better to help developers make applications that load faster rather than trying to paper the cracks?  And surely this will effect processor performance further?<br /><br />The application I work on loads in less than a second and is usable and can load substantial files of half a gig of compressed data and be ready to work with in under a minute.  Also, because of the multithreading the program is still usable whilst the loading process is going on.</div>

Microsoft released the first service pack for Visual Studio .NET 2005 a short while back.  You can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/support/vs2005sp1/default.aspx">download it here</a>.  It is available for all flavours including Express through to the Team editions.  Upon running it I am not finding it any faster or more stable though, at least it hasn&#8217;t broken MFC like the beta version of SP1 did.<br /><br />Also this does not cover Vista compatibility, which is a right pain.  They have released the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=fb6bb56a-10b7-4c05-b81c-5863284503cf&displaylang=en">Vista fixes for SP1 as a beta</a> at the moment.  It does improve a few problems like cancelling compilations actually working without needing to kill the cl.exe process from Task Manager, so it would be worthwhile if you are working on C++ in Vista.</div>
