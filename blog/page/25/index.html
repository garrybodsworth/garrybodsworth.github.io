In the space of two weeks there have been two <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">BCS SPA Cambridge</a> talks organised by <a href="http://blog.software-acumen.com/">Mark Dalgarno</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/ContinuousIntegration">Continuous Integration</a> by <a href="http://oocode.com/">Ivan Moore</a><br /><br />The second talk by Ivan Moore after his interactive talk about Test-Drive-Development (which was a crash course on Java as well).  This time it was not as interactive but just as practical.  In addition to the slides he actually demonstrated his own continuous integration system (available from Sourceforge) <a href="http://build-o-matic.sourceforge.net/">build-o-matic</a>.  It has some interesting features like pictures to show the guilty parties when thebuild or tests break.  It also is quite a simple build system which means you can more or less build anything with it.<br /><br />He was preaching to the converted as most of the audience were practicing continuous integration anyway.  I think the main lesson to take away from the talk is to not compromise at any point on the builds or the tests even in with a heavy workload.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/TypeDrivenTestingInHaskell">Type Driven Development in Haskell</a> by <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/">Simon Peyton-Jones</a><br /><br />This talk was really about how to write more robust programs in functional programming.  The talk involved more of a discussion of functional languages and their benefits as well as how to write tests that more define the concepts and rules for inputs and the outputs.<br /><br />Mostly the testing part reminded me of the static assertions that are available in the C++ Boost Library.  I think that there must be a bridge to utilise more aspects of functional programming in a library like fashion because of the interesting optimisations that can be made.  Also mathematical correctness is a bonus.<br /><br />The lecture itself was interesting and certainly animated.  The sign of a good talk is that it makes you think, and I am certainly thinking about functional languages and their applications (after all templates can be used in that fashion but it does put a lot of strain on the compiler). I can certainly see some useful applications in the field of CAD/CAM - shame I left hat field&#8230;</div>

After nearly a decade of avoiding having a mobile phone the iPhone was the device that made me change my mind.  It is a great device that means I use my laptop a lot less because I can surf the &#8216;Net and get my imap gmail on it in a very seamless fashion.<br /><br />Today Apple announced the iPhone SDK (the website has completely crashed for me&#8230;.).  It will give a whole new ease of life to an already excellent product.  One of the greatest aspects of the iPhone is that it is constantly updated with new features like a full computer.<br /><br />There is a comprehensive <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/06/live-from-apples-iphone-press-conference/">write-up on Engadget</a> and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/03/06/developers-licking-their-fingers-over-cocoa-touch-iphone-sdk">Ars Technica</a> of all the announcements today including proper Exchange support.<br /><br />The SDK gives access via Objective-C to the OS features.  You get access to the accelerometers and multi-touch when writing your apps.  XCode provides the environment to develop in and there is an iPhone simulator. The features you have access to are:<br />* Keychain<br />* Bonjour<br />* SQLite<br />* Core Location<br />* Quicktime media layer<br />* Core Audio<br />* Core Image<br />* Core Animation<br />* PDF rendering<br />* OpenAL<br />* OpenGL ES<br /><br />The games look pretty damn good on the iPhone fromt he presentation from Super Monkey Ball to Spore to the specially designed Touch Fighter.  It looks like a Wii style changing of the game by using the advantages that the device offers rather than dwelling on what is now missing in comparison to gaming systems.<br /><br />Also the apps created will be distributed by the App Store that will be run by Apple.  If you develop free or open-source apps Apple will host them and distribute them for free.<br /><br />Also there is a leak of the BBC iPlayer for the iPhone mentioned in <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/06/live-from-apples-iphone-press-conference/comments/10866456/">this comment</a> on Engadget.</div>

Thanks to a commenter on the <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2008/03/stl-related-rdestl.html">RDESTL post</a> I made yesterday, they pointed me at the <a href="http://ustl.sourceforge.net/">uSTL</a> (I assume pronounced micro-STL).<br /><br />It is a partial implementation of the STL specification.  It reduces code size by making memory allocation a non-templated base class.  As far as I can tell this reduces executable size because of less template bloat.  Whether it is faster or smaller in memory for the containers is another matter.  I suppose by reducing the executable size  cache coherency could be improved leading to some interesting speed-ups.<br /><br />It is for POSIX-based systems, and there is no maintained Windows port (a choice of the developer) although some peole have got it to work on Windows with differing levels of success.<br /><br />And another STL implementation I stumbled across is the <a href="http://stdcxx.apache.org/">Apache stdcxx</a>.  The project was started from a code donation by Rogue Wave who decided to open-source their commercial offering.<br /><br />At the end of 2007 stdcxx made it to an Apache Top-Level Project which means it should be well supported.  And apparently performance s quite good as well.</div>

It&#8217;s always interesting to have a STL implementation that everybody can understand. If you have already had a look at STL implementation and you haven&#8217;t a headache you are very talented.<BR/><BR/>Anyway I have ported ustl for windows platforms and windows CE is in progress.<BR/>You can find it here : http://www.smartmobili.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=41&lang=english</div>

The Visual C++ compiler is actually very good at eliminating code bloat from templates (The COMDAT folding compiler option)<BR/>Often, most instantiations of a template end up identical anyway, so merging them into a single object is a fairly obvious optimization.<BR/><BR/>In my experience, that pretty much eliminates the problem entirely on Windows, so the lack of a Windows port of uSTL doesn&#8217;t seem to be a big deal.<BR/><BR/>By contrast, GCC doesn&#8217;t (or didn&#8217;t) perform similar tricks. They had a fairly long discussion about implementing such an optimization on their dev mailing list a while back, and back then, the consensus was that it would compromise standards compliance (because it could mean multiple functions could end up with the same addresses)<BR/><BR/>I don&#8217;t know if GCC has added this optimization since then, but I doubt it.<BR/><BR/>Which makes uSTL relevant on GCC platforms, but essentially pointless on Windows.</div>

A while back I <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/09/eastl-and-allocators.html">blogged</a> about the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2271.html">EASTL</a> - Electronic Arts Standard Template Library.<br /><br />It is an interesting look at how EA have internally implemented their own STL with their own improvements/changes specific to their problem domain.<br /><br /><a href="http://msinilo.pl/blog/">Maciej Sinilo</a> has spent some time putting together a small subset of the STL changed for some game development requirements called the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rdestl/">RDESTL</a>.  The related blog posts can be read <a href="http://msinilo.pl/blog/?p=25">here</a>, <a href="http://msinilo.pl/blog/?p=28">here</a> and <a href="http://msinilo.pl/blog/?p=33">here</a>.  It provides some basic containers (vector, etc), a string class, and some additional container types like intrusive containers.  It also provides the EASTL outlook on allocators (which I don&#8217;t agree with but that is another story).<br /><br />It is definitely interesting to see the code as it is quite readable.  I do wonder whether it achieved part of the EASTL goal which was allowing the compiler to optimise more aggressively because the code is simpler with less indirection.<br /><br />Also, here is a <a href="http://www.spreetree.net/blog/?p=7">link</a> to someone else who is replacing the STL.  Link via the excellent <a href="http://warpedvisions.org/">warpedvisions</a> (with an excellent biting comment).</div>

Simon Peyton Jones of Microsoft Research is doing the upcoming BCS SPA talk in Cambridge.  The subject is <span style="font-weight:bold;">&#8220;Type-driven testing in Haskell&#8221;</span> so people who have an interest in functional languages should like it.  As usual the talk is free and there is a light buffet.<br /><br />Sign up through <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/TypeDrivenTestingInHaskell">this link</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote>Synopsis:<br /><br />One of the joys of functional programming is that code is so much more testable. For a start, testing pure functions is much easier than testing side-effecting procedures. Better still the auto-generation of test cases can be done by a library, without any external tools. And where we want exhaustive testing, it is possible to use lazy evaluation to cut the search space dramatically. I’ll explain these idea using demos from Quickcheck and Lazy Smallcheck, two popular libraries.<br /><br />While the focus of this talk is testing, I’ll introduce functional programming as I go along, so that you don’t already have to know Haskell to make sense of the ideas. I’ll also try to give a flavour of why I think you’ll be seeing a lot more crossover of functional programming ideas into the mainstream, over the next few years. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Simon Peyton Jones</span><br /><br />Simon Peyton Jones, MA, MBCS, CEng, graduated from Trinity College Cambridge in 1980. After two years in industry, he spent seven years as a lecturer at University College London, and nine years as a professor at Glasgow University, before moving to Microsoft Research (Cambridge) in 1998.<br /><br />His main research interest is in functional programming languages, their implementation, and their application. He has led a succession of research projects focused around the design and implementation of production-quality functional-language systems for both uniprocessors and parallel machines. He was a key contributor to the design of the now-standard functional language Haskell, and is the lead designer of the widely-used Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). He has written two textbooks about the implementation of functional languages.<br /><br />More generally, he is interested in language design, rich type systems, software component architectures, compiler technology, code generation, runtime systems, virtual machines, and garbage collection. He is particularly motivated by direct use of principled theory to practical language design and implementation &#8211; that&#8217;s one reason he loves functional programming so much.<br /><br />His home page is at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj">http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj</a>.<br /></blockquote></div>

A while back I <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/10/gui-toolkits-some-thoughts.html">blogged about some ideas</a> for GUI toolkits, not that I ever managed to get off my backside and do something about it.<br /><br />Well someone has done a great job with a DSEL (domain specific embedded language) with a toolkit called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mythos/">Mythos</a>.  To quote the website <span style="font-style:italic;">&#8220;Mythos is a GUI library written in C++ using modern C++ techniques.&#8221;</span>  It does state on the website that it is more of a proof of concept than a fully-blown attempt.<br /><br />Still, it looks really interesting and has a few different components that make it up.  There is <span style="font-weight:bold;">khaos</span> which does the low level windowing bits and pieces.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">nyx</span> is the window layout library with a DSEL that lets you define the ayout in the C++ files.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">iris</span> does the event handling with another DSEL for associating events and actions.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">gaia</span> is the widget abstraction.<br /><br />Overall it looks like a very interesting use of modern C++ applied to GUI toolkits.  It is a different approach to something like <a href="http://stlab.adobe.com/">Adobe&#8217;s ASL</a> (adam and eve) but I think if the use of the code generation available through templates should be used to take the legwork out of defining user interfaces.  Mythos, which is the work of one person as far as I can tell (Benaka Moorthi) is a pretty neat accomplishment.</div>

There is nothing more depressing than knowing you have to use a computer loaded up with Vista, especially when developing, because it is a constant battle.<br /><br />But deep in the bowels of the OS there are some interesting things, but they tend to be undocumented.  I&#8217;m not a fan of the layering of the GUI, and I always wondered if it was possible to use the base parts of the GUI DLLs which things like WP use as teir basis.<br /><br />Some exceedingly talented and clever developers have spent their brain cycles reverse engineering the completely undocumented dwm and milcore.dll (apart from the thumbnail API).  I&#8217;m not a fan of all the managed stuff especially since it mainly resoves down to the unmanaged core DLLs anyway.  Go <a href="http://siwu.info/">check out the blog here</a> with lots of videos of some exceedingly clever things.<br /><br />What is even better is that the developer has released it as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dwmaxx/">open-source</a>.  Hopefully this will provide a basis for more adventurous and useful developments.  With this amount of flexibility available then it should be possible to create something where Vista gets some good productivity gains.</div>

I&#8217;m tight, if there is a free tool to do something I will find it.

An interesting library I stumbled across on the Internet the other day enables the user to accelerate general code by using your graphics hardware.  An open-source library <a href="http://libsh.org/">libsh</a> provides a high level metaprogramming language in C++ for programming GPUs.<br /><br />Unfortunately, libsh is no longer actively developed because the developers behind it have created a commercial business around it (those lucky guys have found a way to make programming pay!)<br /><br />It would be nice to utilise the processing power of the GPU, essentially treating the hardware like another (more specialised) processing core.  After all graphics cards have more transistors than the average CPU&#8230;  I think I mentioned something like this in my <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/12/multiple-core-madness.html">multithreading post</a> many a moon ago.  But I suppose also it ties into virtualisation of the procesing hardware available on the computer which I even <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/10/virtualisation-understanding.html">posted about before</a>.<br /><br />A great website for this type of stuff is <a href="http://www.gpgpu.org/">General-Purpose Computation Using Graphics Hardware</a> which does exactly what it says on the tin.  There are active forums and tons of news and information.<br /><br />Surprisingly there is not a huge amount of general purpose stuff out there freely available but as GPUs become more powerful and more programmable I am sure that will change.  Personally I think the future would be to use a core of these multi-core processors to do the graphics, even if it is slightly specialised for stream processing or something.  That would certainly negate the need for faster graphics buses as it would run on the processor (although other buses would still need to progress).  But yet again I have digressed&#8230;.</div>

I&#8217;ve mentioned before about the usefulness of <a href="http://www.gimpel.com/">PC-Lint</a> when doing C++ development on Windows.  It closes off a whole class of bugs that can live in a codebase and raises teh minimum standard of development.<br /><br />I came across a really decent article you can read <a href="http://powerof2games.com/node/27">here</a>.  They integrated it into their automated build process and bootstrapped Msbuild to use it.<br /><br />Also, you can&#8217;t forget that there are some good tools that can make it easier to use.  There is <a href="http://www.riverblade.co.uk/products/lintproject/">LintProject</a> to run Lint across an entire project, and also there is the <a href="http://www.riverblade.co.uk/products/visual_lint/index.html">Visual Lint</a> which is a nice integration into Visual Studio.<br /><br />It would be nice however if somehow it was possible to integrate it completely with the cl.exe commandline.</div>

Hi,<BR/><BR/>It would be nice to have more options on the compiler to help with things like const-correctness, uninitialised data and the suchlike.<BR/><BR/>Admittedly Lint is on version 8.0 but it is on something like revision &#8220;v&#8221; and there is one for each letter of the alphabet ;)<BR/><BR/>I think that the tool is so simple to use that it kind of transcends the new version needed philosophy.  I imagine if they supplied the integration with lots of products there would be even less versions of Lint out&#8230;<BR/><BR/>PVCS 5.3?  Will any of the conversion scripts out there work for that to get to a new revision control system?  The one I have seen works on version 6.8 upwards&#8230;<BR/><BR/>Thanks,<BR/>Garry</div>

What I would like is an opensource version of it. Something that has been around so long, you would of thought that the large OS developers would be in need of such a tool and thus a project be born.<BR/><BR/>When I saw the powerof2 article, I had a look at our software cupboard and there was a copy of PCLint7.5 dated 1998. So in 10 years it has advanced less than a single version:-)<BR/><BR/>Then again we are using PVCS5.3 - a horribly broken Windows 3.1 program botched to Win95 while Team Foundation Server sits in the aforementioned cupboard. But that is an article in itself.</div>
