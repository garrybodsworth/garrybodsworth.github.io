Make your Ubuntu look extremely cool. This theme is fantastic and clear, and I particularly like the fact that there are no window borders! How this isn&#8217;t the default theme for some distribution I have no idea. Oh yeah, make sure you have the Firefox theme as well to make it look more integrated.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>The most exciting thing for me about the new <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/10/14/crunchgear-live-at-the-apple-notebook-event/">MacBooks</a> announced today is seeing the manufacturing process. You can watch the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/#designvideo">video here</a>.</p>

<p>You see I used to write software that did exactly that kind of machining up until about 10 months ago. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing">CAM</a> programming is not for the faint-hearted. Seeing proper videos online of what CAM software actually does is something of a rarity since most CAD/CAM companies obfuscate their online presence.</p>

<p>In the video you can see lots of liquid coolant being pumped onto the solid block whilst the cutter does the hard work. I&#8217;m just wondering what software is being used to create the toolpaths, especially since there are only a handful of packages capable of doing it, as well as a lot of them use the same algorithms internally. In fact whoever&#8217;s software is doing it should be shouting it from the rooftops, its the closest thing the CAM industry has had to publicity</p>

<p>When you see the &#8220;back&#8221; of the laptop shell you can see the toolpath&#8217;s route around the job. It seems to have a large stepover (the gap between paths). I&#8217;d be interested to know how long each one takes to run the toolpath because <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk">I know someone</a> who is really good at writing this type of software. I&#8217;d also be interested to know whether the software I used to work on would have done the job.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing around Intrepid Ibex on my Macbook Pro. I discovered Parallels frankly is pretty poor in Ubuntu support so I decided to try out <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.</p>

<p>I downloaded the latest Intrepid Ibex Beta and it installed quickly and cleanly on the virtual machine. Then I installed the the Guest Additions that improve the performance of working in the virtual machine (the equivalent would not play ball with me on Parallels even with Hardy 8.04). There is a bit of manual tweaking to get it all working because the resolution is stuck at 800&#215;600. What you need to do is edit your <em>xorg.conf</em> by typing the following in terminal <code>sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code></p>

<p>You need to replace the contents of the file with (just choose your resolution by replacing 1024&#215;768):</p>

<pre>Section "Device"
   Identifier   "Configured Video Device"
   Driver    "vboxvideo"
EndSection
Section "Monitor"
    Identifier  "Configured Monitor"
EndSection
Section "Screen"
   Identifier    "Default Screen"
   Device    "VirtualBox graphics card"
   Monitor    "Generic Monitor"

<div class="post-content"><p>There is a good <a href="http://torvalds-family.blogspot.com/2008/10/on-making-releases.html">blog post by Linus Torvalds about making releases</a>. Making releases is extremely difficult and the last stretch is always the most difficult to make.</p>

<p>The most interesting part is the relative quietness as the release approaches with respect to commits. As you are heading towards something more stable the verification and amount of work to diagnose and repair takes more time. The scary parts sounds like the deluge of commits immediately after of patches held back due to stability and testing.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Once more the Internet is abuzz with another set of articles denigrating C++. The original <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=532">post by Eric Raymond</a> was linked to from <a href="http://osnews.com/comments/20381">OSNews</a> and had <a href="http://www.blogistan.co.uk/blog/mt.php/2008/10/10/the_enduring_appeal_of_c">a very considered response here</a>. Each language has its good and bad points, the same as anything on this planet. The ire should be pointed at bad programmers, bad education, bad communication and a lack of cold detachment.</p>

<p>The reason the workman quote came into my head wasn&#8217;t a reflection on the programmers making these statements (they are much more talented and prolific than I am). They have obviously been burnt by bad code that they feel could have been avoided if the language was better.</p>

<p>My feeling is that it is always easy to attack something and attempt to tear it down. For something that seems like a scientific field like programming there is virtually no scientific basis for these intuitions apart from anecdotal evidence which is pretty much worthless. All programming languages have good and bad points, some notionally target different domains and some attempt to solve other problems. Some of these problems can involve attempting to lower the cognitive barrier for entry or error rates in less able/interested programmers. A lot of arguments against could easily substitute other programming languages and the articles sound just as feasible.</p>

<p><strong>Bad programmers</strong><br/>
Noone is ever pleased with the quality of their code, but some programmers use dangerous constructs and are simply not qualified to write code. This can colour your own experience of working with a programming language because the human brain is extremely adept at constructing relationships that are simply not there.</p>

<p><strong>Bad education</strong><br/>
Education is important. Having a good basis in mathematics is always a good start, but also being taught the basis of programming in a language neutral form is extremely important. Also when you get to specific languages you are taught the concepts in a fashion that you can see why and how.</p>

<p>The most important aspect though is squarely on the shoulders of the programmer, it is their responsibility to carry on their own development, mainly due to a lack of professional bodies like what exists in other professions to keep their skills up to date. When these two elements align hopefully a programmer can think critically when given the time about the underlying basis of what they are doing.</p>

<p><strong>Bad communication</strong><br/>
Inability to articulate reasoning for decisions is obviously bad, but that isn&#8217;t the biggest problem. It is political communication where attempting to win an argument is done through negative methods. Whether it is true or not it is damaging anyway and obfuscates any real issues that could be addressed.</p>

<p><strong>A lack of cold detachment</strong><br/>
This is seriously difficult to do. We are all guilty of these and it takes a massive amount of effort to achieve. You have to ask yourself what are your goals? To seek out the truth or to win the argument at any cost.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve programmed in a number of programming languages and they all have good and bad points. If someone says there is a bad point about one of them with good reasoning then I either find a workaround or no to avoid it. That is purely pragmatic and does not on its own make a bad language, and even a long list of these does not do so, because each one can have a list just as long. By removing your own personal gut feelings from the equation you can see that any argument is just wasting time from presenting good and solid solutions to problems.</p>

<p>Even statistics can be manipulated to say what you want by loading the test. I have seen massive differences in synthetic benchmarks when compared to real-world applications, which normally comes from creating the benchmark when you already know the result you want to see.</p>

<p>What would be good would be a programming wiki where people looked at the problems and then provide answers to make programming better. I guess this sounds to me like peer-reviewed papers so maybe a better way of accessing good quality papers and knowing their quality.</p>

<p>After all providing solutions is what programmers do, right?</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>One of the most interesting parts of the new Python 2.6 is the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing">multiprocessing</a> module now available. This will massively simplify the problem of writing an application that has multiple processes.</p>

<p>The problem with multiprocessing before is that you spend ages writing a framework and boilerplate to do things like messaging, monitoring, and starting/stopping processes. This is a right pain and has its own share of bugs. You need to think how to pass state between the processes normally resorting to using the stdout/stdin mechanism.</p>

<p>The multiprocessing module provides an interface indistinguishable from the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html">threading</a> interface. It means you end up writing multiple processes in the same way you would write threads &#8211; which is pretty darn easy. The only guilt you will feel when you use it is when you are chucking away bucketfulls of redundant code.</p>

<p>I think this also will make it really easy to share logging between processes which if you do manually you will be finding problems until the end of time. This is especially interesting with a rotating log because you won&#8217;t have to worry about multiple processes making different decisions. I don&#8217;t know what the communication overhead will be for using it though&#8230;</p>

<p>Also with this library you are given ways to synchronise between processes and you can even share data. These are obviously going to have a lot of applications and be extremely useful.</p>
