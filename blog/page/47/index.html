I didn&#8217;t even realise until just now, 50 posts down and still no idea what I should be concentrating on.  Obviously this blog has a real GUI flavour, but I can&#8217;t help writing about random computer subjects like media PCs and interesting new things.<br /><br />I still haven&#8217;t finished my trek through the new world of Vista.  Not only the guidelines, but also getting a more in-depth look at the C API headers and getting some documentation together about it.<br /><br />There are also some GUI toolkits I haven&#8217;t got round to looking at like the <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/">Adobe Open-Source Libraries</a> and <a href="http://smartwin.sourceforge.net/">SmartWin++</a>.  Also, I still feeel like I need to look at lots of the others in more depth.  And most importantly I want to get some source code out there rather than just talking about it all the time ;)<br /><br />Anyway, here is to the next 50 posts.</div>

My discovery of this toolkit was from the article posted about the <a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/nov06/4696">Firefox Kid</a>.  At the end it linked to the blogs of the two Parakey developers <a href="http://www.blakeross.com/">Blake Ross</a> and <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/">Joe Hewitt</a>.  The article was abou Blake Ross but it turns out Joe Hewitt&#8217;s blog was really the more interesting.<br /><br />This is how I discovered <a href="http://dev.aol.com/boxely/">Boxely</a>.  Joe Hewitt&#8217;s posts about it are here:<br /><a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/boxely_is_final.php">His post about the release of Boxely.</a><br /><a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/boxely_part_1_o.php">Boxely - Part 1.</a><br /><a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/boxely_part_2_o.php">Boxely - Part 2.</a><br /><a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/boxely_part_3_o.php">Boxely - Part 3.</a><br /><br />Boxely was envisioned as a lighter weight more powerful XUL type UI toolkit.  It is an XML and Javascript toolkit for creating desktop applications in the same family as XUL and XAML.  It was initially put together for the AIM client, and to allow extensibility.  Reading the articles it seems that Boxely&#8217;s existence is a lucky break.  Due to being integrated with more AOL services over time it seems that it is more bloated than it started with.<br /><br />It seems to be capable of some really nice graphics and also integrated animations.  I don&#8217;t know how much XUL/XULRunner has improved to close the gap on the features that Boxely has.  It&#8217;s almost a shame that the earlier versions were not released without the COM stuff as it all sounded pretty good.<br /><br /><a href="http://dev.aol.com/boxely/">Boxely is available for download</a> now and seems pretty capable.  I, however, don&#8217;t know if it is worth investigating further as XULRunner seems to do a pretty good job with stuff like <a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/">SongBird</a>.  In fact I think the sentiments and vision behind the initial design is more more interesting than perhaps the final product.</div>

Boxely has changed significantly since Joe&#8217;s original chapter series on its conception.  <br /><br />And in fact it is quite a bit better than XUL/XULRunner in many ways, I encourage you to download the SDK and play with the samples.<br /><br />That said, a XUL based app would be 5 or 6 times the size of a Boxely/OCP based app, fwiw (not that size matters right). As an example of a fairly tight, non-bloated Boxely app see: <br /><br /><a href="http://greenhouse.aol.com/prod.jsp?prod_id=27<br />&#8220;>AIM Lite (LAIM)</a><br /><br />Have fun&#8230;</div>

<a href="http://www.mythtv.org">MythTV</a> is a Linux-based media centre program, but it also gives you so much more than that.  I have to say that this is better than any other media centre software out there.  Why is this?<br /><br />It has been designed from the outset to provide a client/server architecture.  This probably doesn&#8217;t mean much to many people at the moment, but it is certainly the way forward.  What you have is a back-end that provides the media content, then you have front-ends that allow you to access that content.<br /><br />The simplest install is to have the back-end and front-end on the same computer, providing the same functionality as any other media system.  If you plan to have more than one front-end you have have the back-end on another computer, but both will be able to access it.  The back-end is also responsible for recording the TV and cataloguing the data, so you can stick a few TV cards in there and make simultaneous viewing and recordings.  And for your front-end you can make it as powerful or lightweight and silent as you want as you can limit the moving parts when the brute force (apart from decoding) is provided by the server.<br /><br />The real power comes from the client/server architecture, as the front-ends can be implemented in anything that you can connect to the <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> protocol.  This is most apparent because it easily has a front-end for web access (meaning you can schedule your recordings remotely), there are also other smaller front-ends to the default and even a small one for Windows which is functional.  The back-end server software is pretty much rock solid because it builds on the foundations of Apache and MySQL.<br /><br />Recently version 0.20 was released with a whole raft of new functionality including OpenGL UI rendering and a more library based architecture.  You can see the rather long <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Release_Notes_-_0.20">changelog here</a>.<br /><br />If you want to try this out you can also do this without installing it thanks to the wonders of <a href="http://www.mysettopbox.tv/knoppmyth.html">KnoppMyth</a>.  This is a <a href="http://www.knoppix.net/">Knoppix</a> based distribution on a CD/DVD with MythTV set up so you can try it out and if you like it install it.<br /><br />There is also <a href="http://swik.net/MythDora">MythDora</a> a Fedora-based MythTV distribution.  This is based on Fedora Core 4, a little out of date.<br /><br />There is an excellent resource for getting <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> installed for Fedora <a href="http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/fcmyth.php">here</a>.  This is highly recommended and comprehensive.<br /><br />Also, for the Ubuntu people out there, you can use <a href="http://parker1.co.uk/mythtv_ubuntu.php">this resource</a> to get the information you need.<br /><br />Lets not forget the <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/modules.php?name=MythInstall">excellent documentation</a> and the <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Wiki</a>.  You can see some <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Category:Themes">themes here</a> and some <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/modules.php?name=MythFeatures">screenshots here</a>.  Also there are thriving communities including the forums and mailing lists at MythTV itself and KnoppMyth, and there is also <a href="http://www.mythtvtalk.com/">MythTV Talk</a>.<br /><br />And here is a screenshot for the curious:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/1600/Retro.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/320/Retro.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>

As of the 12th November it is more up to date than KnoppMyth, unfortunately this post was done a week before that news update.  Certainly with an older Linux distribution and kernel surely some drivers would be missing.<br /><br />I personally would probably use http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/fcmyth.phpto get it all up and running Fedora, but I am that way inclined.</div>

Why would you say that MythDora is out of date? Just because it&#8217;s FC4? Thats nothing to go by. MythDora is more up to date than KnoppMyth.</div>

And now for a complete change of pace&#8230;<br /><br />One thing I particularly like doing it fiddling about with home-made HTPCs (Home Theatre PCs).  I&#8217;ve built myself a little system for a little over £200 involving an AOpen XC-Cube.  This became necessary when we moved house and the main computer was moved away from the TV.<br /><br />I decided to use Windows for the OS for expediency&#8217;s sake and as the graphics chipset on the motherboard was not well supported in Linux.  I could have gone for Windows XP MCE Edition, but I already knew of an alternative I preferred.<br /><br />Check out <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/">MediaPortal</a> for a fully featured media centre system that is fully open-source.  This project actually grew out of the well respected <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.de/">XBox Media Centre (XBMC)</a>.  It looks and feels great and has full compatibility with things like MCE remotes.  They&#8217;ve recently updated to an unstable build of 0.2.1.0 which I have found completely stable for my own uses, but I tend to only watch TV/TV programs on it.  Also, more excitingly they have started work on the TV Server project so that the TV cards and content can be hosted on a back-end server and the actual media PC can be as trimmed down as you can make it.<br /><br />There are also a variety of skins to make it look really good, a lot of which broke with version 0.2.1.0 as there were some substantial changes to the XML format.  Here is a list of some working ones:<br /><ul><li>MCE is currently missing (the one that looks very similar to Windows Media Centre Edition) but will be reinstated to the release very soon (it is probably already accessible under solution).</li><li><a href="http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/showthread.php?t=11947">MePo skins</a> - These are fantastic featuring the new mascot type character MePo.</li><li><a href="http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/showthread.php?t=12133">Simplify</a> - A bit of an understated skin.</li><li><a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/files/Download/Codecs/Replicant0.2/">Replicant</a></li><li><a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/files/Download/Skins/4:3/SimpleMP-Beta1/">SimpleMP</a></li><li><a href="http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/showthread.php?t=5212">Vista Style MCE</a></li><li>KIS - Looks incredibly impressive but I have not had a chance to download and play with it yet.  There is <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/files/Download/Skins/16:9/KISbeta/">KIS</a>, <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/files/Download/Skins/16:9/KIS/">KIS Dark</a>, and the <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/files/Download/Skins/16:9/SkinSourceFiles/KISSDK/">KIS SDK</a> for plug-in pages.</li></ul>MediaPortal has coverage for emulators (I had a lot of fun with this and my arcade joystick), built-in games, weather, music, DVDs, TV, radio, films, and numerous plug-ins.  Since it is also simply an application you can install and use it on any supported PC.  It may not be the most technologically advanced or have the best architecture, but it does the job more than admirably and more importantly it is as easy to use as running the installer and following the setup wizard.</div>

<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I remember reading online when Apple first released their new remote with the new Intel iMacs/MacBooks/MacMinis that people said it would be no good because it didn&#8217;t have enough buttons, and after all their Windows Media Centre remotes had 46 buttons, so it must be better.  But when people start using these user interfaces (after all that is what they are) I somehow doubt the 46 button monster is the winner.</span><br><br>So you are going to write something for Windows Vista?  I suppose you can jump in with both feet and see what you end up with, you might get lucky.  Or I suppose planning could be the best way forward.  When developing for any platform you need to follow the human computer interface (HCI) guidelines that give you the general rules. <br><br>In my previous <a title="guidelines post" href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/user-interface-guidelines.html">guidelines post</a>   I provided links to various guides that are available.  In most cases it varies from company to company as to the UI design guidelines and if you are really unlucky it comes down to you. <br><br>The problem with Windows Vista is a lack of consistency when trying to come up with design guidelines for your own project.  For such a new platform you have to look at the existing applications in order to decide what is best practice. <br><br>With Windows XP you can see the problems already.  Look at the differences between Windows Media Player, Office 2003, Visual Studio .NET, and now IE7.  They all follow different looks, different usage paradigms, and are simply inconsistent.  For IE7 they have done away with default menu usage which is completely different to what is expected for a Windows application.  Even the way toolbars and buttons look and feel is not quite the same.  I suppose that this can be seen as paving the way for the Vista UI transition, but we are using XP not Vista.  It almost suggests there is no transition path satisfactory for both platforms. <br><br>One of the eye openers when you first start using Windows Vista is a complete lack of coherency and consistency.  I know people would prefer to let their imagination run away unfettered, but guidelines are there to bring the worst applications up to the minimum standard, not drag the best ones down.<br><br>The lack of consistency is shown at its best in this <a title="excellent blog post by Dave Vronay" href="http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2006/09/20/What-happened-to-the-menu-bars_3F00_.aspx">blog post by Dave Vronay</a>.  In the past we have had the simple yet powerful design paradigms of menus, toolbars, and recently the more extended multifunction type toolbar (like with the search bar).  Looking at the various programs available built-in to Vista they all seem to be pulling in different directions with their usage.  Sure, not every program will be shoehorned into a limited and strict user interface.<br><br>Lets have a look at three of the main applications that people will see in Windows Vista.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Internet Explorer 7</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">This will be the one most people see.  There seems to be odd behaviour where a new toolbar row can be inserted with just one item on it which seems to appear when there is only one tab (apparently a PDF bar I don&#8217;t remember installing).  Whereas the tabs row seems to have loads of options and information crammed onto it.  The help is accessed via a chevron on the right hand side.  Menus still drop down when you select an item which has a triangle next to it.  I am finding the only thing that has really changed is the position of the menus, and they still exist but they do not have text - they use icons, and they have randomly grouped stuff together in an overcrowded tab row.<br><br><img title="IE7" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dhp3xkhx_5j9kzvc" align="bottom" border="0" height="273" hspace="0" vspace="10" width="376"><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows Media Player 11</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">This has always been the odd application out for years, looking completely different to standard window apps, with random sporadic dynamic changes to display a proper window frame or something equally as useless.  It has no toolbar as such, although it could probably be described as at the bottom of the screen&#8230;  The menu tabs across the top switch you into different views for different operations and the proper menus are hidden away on the right click if you do not choose the standard window frame.  I think it really is a case of one application trying to perform too many tasks.<br><img title="WMP11" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dhp3xkhx_9fnm44z" align="bottom" border="0" height="348" hspace="0" vspace="10" width="450"><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Office 2007</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">Now enter the ribbon as a menu and toolbar replacement.  This could be really good or really bad, I can&#8217;t make a judgement to decide what is more productive, it might turn out to be good.  But again it is another different way of controlling your application.  If these were the way forward, surely the default Microsoft developed applications would also be going down the same route?<br><img title="Office 2007" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dhp3xkhx_10dtsswb" align="bottom" border="0" height="294" hspace="0" vspace="10" width="450"><br><br>In summary, you can (or maybe not) have menu bars and/or toolbars, use tabs to switch functionality, do away with menu bars, mix up toolbars with tab bars, have icons instead of text for menu bars, or allow menu bars to pop up randomly, or use a ribbon which is kind of like a menu bar and a toolbar except more dynamic.  Confused?  You should be!  And that is only three applications!<br><br>So the developers making the applications have to make a decision, what is the best course forward for their program taking into consideration the bountiful supply of ideas from Microsoft?  I can guarantee not one of them will come up with the exact same answer.  I&#8217;ve always followed the K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple, Stupid) philosophy, and I am not entirely sure how to apply it to this situation.<br><br>Over my next series of posts I will be digging my way through the UI guidelines of Vista and trying to navigate and at least get clear in my head the way forward.<br><br></div>

<a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/nov06/4696">Read the article: The Firefox Kid</a><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Blake Ross helped make Firefox one of the biggest open-source success stories ever. Just wait until you see what he&#8217;s up to now.</span><br /><br />One of the founders and perhaps they should be called visionaries of the <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">Firefox</a> project has revealed what he is working on now.  It is that integration of network and personal computer into something more useful, sometimes referred to as the web-based OS.<br /><br />He is one fo the founders of the Mozilla Firefox project (if you think about it, IE completely dominated and there was noone left to fight), a self-taught programmer, a believer in open-source, and he is only 20 years old.  Kind of depressing (if you are older than him) but uplifting (something good for the future).  I recommend reading the article which kind of reveals where he is coming from and where he wants to go.<br /><br />Anyway, the idea he has is called Parakey (no website yet), and it is supposed to be integrated and synchronised storage for offline and online work, as well as sharing information over the Internet.  It is supposed to take the headaches for getting content from whatever device and storing that content for use.  It wants to be as simple as possible for managing media and allow non-technologically minded people to use those sharing services that are otherwise out of their reach.  Then the content would be accessible from the same interface whether you are on your home computer or any other around the world.<br /><br />It seems like a decent idea providing it can come to fruition, but these things don&#8217;t always live up to the grand dreams.  It&#8217;s an interesting interview anyway.</div>

In a previous post I have mentioned the splendid free IDE <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">Code::Blocks</a>, but in the dark old days of a few years ago, before Microsoft gave stuff away for free and development was quite an expensive endevour, there existed <a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html">DevC++</a>.  It was a free IDE written in Delphi that provided good library management and also was an IDE for GCC in Windows.<br /><br />Over the years other IDEs have sprung up and essentially overtaken Dev-C++ in terms of features and quality.  Then someone decided to make a branch, one that was going to have integrated GUI editing.  This project eventually became <a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/">wxDevC++</a>.<br /><br />A new version has just been released with even more features from wxWidgets integrated into the GUI editor.  Most importantly it now has support for Visual C++ compilers (v6, 2003, and 2005) which is interesting.  I need to go and check out this IDE in more detail, but it is good to see it is more than alive and kicking.  If you are a wxWidgets developer it is one of the most comprehensive integrated IDEs for developing and looks like it will be going from strength to strength judging from the <a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/changelog.php#610">changelog</a> for this version.<br /><br />And here is a little screenshot with the GUI editor up from their <a href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/">website</a>:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/1600/thumbnail.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/320/thumbnail.png" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>

On the topic of: visually oriented programming IDEs with GUI designer matrices, U++ another C++ development tool is up and coming rapidly.<BR/><BR/> It is powerful with stramlined template handling for C++ and the code files look like C#&#8217;s in size.<BR/><BR/> The com for the control components never seems to go past a sentence&#8217;s worth of statement.<BR/><BR/> Succint coding is U++ tagline.<BR/><BR/> The only noticable problems with U++ are: the actual coding comes off as a branching of standard C++ bringing with it a culture shock for C++ programmers, the bug report output is a bit on the vague side, the IDE is a bit too strict with the setup of a project, and there are far too few reference resources.<BR/><BR/> Do not be fooled by the short-comings as the resources that do exist are excellent. With the coding you can be comfortable in about thirty days I would say and your off to the races.<BR/><BR/> The U++ IDE is definitely about brevity, precision, speed, more speed, and cross-platform development with mobile computational devices coming up in the near future.<BR/><BR/> Check into U++; you will not be disappointed.</div>

DevC++ was definitely a hallmark in the history of open source IDE technology. Ansi and ISO C/C++ handling as-well-as the Package Manager(PackMan) threw DevC++ to the forefront.<BR/><BR/> wxDevC++ has and will continue to leverage these same powerful frameworks. The look and feel of wxDevC++ is quite similar to Visual Studio products bringing with it a familiarity. Unfortunately the controls are a bit unmanaged and thrown together at the moment.<BR/><BR/> The newer wxWidgets v2.8 recommendations for wxWidget&#8217;s namespace change is incorporated. Sizer components are however buggy and are of a serious issue within the wxWidget community. Proportions are not handled correctly at all and are paramount within the sizer struct.<BR/><BR/> In conclusion: it would appear that the product is operation with a seriously limited capacity at this point. wxDevC++ does handle generic C++, virtual classes, and references very nicely. This alone says that the product is capable.<BR/><BR/> The development stage of wxDevC++ would realistically put one in the frame of mind that: the IDE is a no holds barred peddle to the metal dev endev. Something this young with this broad a scope would have more serious issues to contend with.<BR/><BR/> the developers of wxDevC++ have been hard at work and have just started on the path. I suspect that the product with such a young and talented staff of developers is going to provide an excellent platform for cross development systems.</div>

Another stop on the way to a fuller look at the Vista User Interface Guidelines.  This will be the last one I promise&#8230;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">WINDOWS XP</span><br /><br />For designing any user interface in Windows XP (and generally Windows) you need to know <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch14e.asp">Design Specifications and Guidelines - Visual Design</a>.  This specifies how you are supposed to lay out your user interface and how allthe elements should fit together.  I use this to hand code my resources for MFC user interfaces, when it is all consistent you will be surprised how much better and more professional it looks.  One thing I can&#8217;t remember if it is covered is make sure your tab order is correct as when working with resources it is possible to get it wrong.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">VISTA</span><br /><br />The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/UxGuide/UXGuide/Home.asp">Windows Vista User Experience Guidelines</a> have been available for a while.  By available I mean exist as a placeholder that someone will eventually be forced to write.<br /><br />The most substantive part of the Vista UI Guidelines is the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/UxGuide/UXGuide/Resources/TopRules/TopRules.asp">Top Rules for the Windows Vista User Experience</a> which are extremely shallow and a bit of a red herring for good UI design.  It even asks for things that the applications provided with Windows Vista are unable to follow.<br /><br />All of the Vista guideline are so shallow that even the most obvious things like what will be the user interface differences between Basic and other Vista versions are not covered.  For those of you that haven&#8217;t heard the standard home version of Vista will be supplied with the &#8220;Aero Basic&#8221; theme that does not have the bells and whistles.  It makes no mention of how to lay out controls consistently and intuitively.  Also it says use Vista style icons and so on, unfortunately the icon guidelines hve not been published yet.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">APPLE</span><br /><br />Trust <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> to show you how it is done.  They have comrehensive developer documentation on how to supply a well integrated consistent interface for OS X.  They can be read <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/">here</a>.<br /><br />The human interface guidelines are available <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/index.html">here</a>.  This covers all you need to know for a professional looking OS X application.  The documents keep evolving and get better like with the recent <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGIcons/chapter_14_section_2.html">icon addition</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Gnome</span><br /><br />The Gnome desktop has a well know <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/2.0/">human interface guidelines</a>.  It is really quite in-depth and puts Microsoft to shame.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">KDE</span><br /><br />The popular Linux desktop environment also has a set of <a href="http://developer.kde.org/documentation/standards/kde/style/basics/index.html">user interface guidelines</a>.<br /><br /><br />You can read a previous post about icon guidelines for various platforms <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/icons-icons-icons.html">here</a>.</div>

Windows Vista is just around the corner.  As a developer you worry about what a new OS version is going to do to the program you work on, most incremental cases are pretty trivial, XP introduced a virtually undocumented theming API (and it still pretty much is), SP2 opened up a whole can of pain, Vista has even bigger problems on the horizon.<br /><br />But this post isn&#8217;t about those migration problems, I&#8217;ll be covering them as I tear my hair out at work, much like my migrations to Visual Studio 2005.<br /><br />From this GUI developer&#8217;s point of view I&#8217;ll cover my thought process:<ul><li><b>&#8220;Does my UI work under this upgraded platform?&#8221;</b><br />Ignoring the platform issues, does the user interface work on the new platform.  This means does it render without causing corruption and does it crash?  It&#8217;s a simple case of running the executable.</li><li><b>&#8220;Does it look good?&#8221;</b><br />Now the user interface is usable, does it look integrated with the rest of the system?  This means checking custom draw items work and match the system theme.  Once you&#8217;ve made sure you have made no glaring errors the program is probably usable on the new platform.</li><li><b>&#8220;Does it look consistent with other programs on that platform?&#8221;</b><br />Now this is where the realy hard work start.  Some platforms actually provide user interface (HCI) guidelines that are worth the virtual paper they are written on like the Apple ones, some are not like Vista.  My next post will cover this point in greater detail.</li><li><b>&#8220;Has the migration made our user&#8217;s lives better or easier?&#8221;</b><br />Has the shiny new look cheered our user&#8217;s lives up?  Has it made the user&#8217;s lives easier, say for instance the new common controls provide even more functionality as standard?</li><li><b>&#8220;What can be added incrementally?&#8221;</b><br />Are there new features available to the developers that can be added in an incremental fashion, either phasing out old items or introducing new paradigms.  This will also be the implementation of features seen as extras by the HCI guidelines.</li><li><b>&#8220;Can you separate yourself from the crowd?&#8221;</b><br />This is the lowest priority item.  Are there things you can do that look good, but also serve to separate you from the rest of the crowd (but please keep them within the HCI guidelines, PLEASE!)</li></ul>Well, I will end this random ramble though my thought processes, but I am expending valuable brain power on this knowing I have to sort this out in the near future.  Since Vista is going to manufacturers very soon it all seems tangible now.</div>

No, I haven&#8217;t lost all typing skills, it is really called qooxdoo.<br /><br /><a href="http://qooxdoo.org/">qooxdoo</a> (see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qooxdoo">Wikipedia</a>) is an AJAX targetted Javascript user interface toolkit.  It is surprisingly fully featured and shows how far along web-based toolkits have come.  Well, when I say surprising, I mean shocking.<br /><br />The toolkit is LGPL licensed and has a large set of widgets available.  I think the best way to describe it is to send you to the demo page <a href="http://qooxdoo.org/demo">here</a> and I would recommend you look at <a href="http://demo.qooxdoo.org/html/at-a-glance/index.html">this example</a> in particular.  There is no point in looking at the screenshots as playing round with the demos demonstrates its depth of features and how polished they are.<br /><br />The advantages of this kit for web development include the abstraction away of web browser specifics and automatic browser detection.  It has things that are normally only seen in fully fledged desktop environments like drag-n-drop support.  Like I said earlier though I think the demos speak for themselves.</div>

No probs Si.  I found the whole thing astonishing when I found it, then I rebuilt my computer and forgot about it completely until a bit of paper just saying qooxdoo turned up by the computer today ;)<br /><br />If it was possible to make a web browser with no frame and a transparent window it would look pretty integrated with the system (not perfect for XP though at the moment).</div>
