I realised the other day how many Google products I was using&#8230;<ul><li>Analytics</li><li>Blogger</li><li>Browser Sync</li><li>Calendar</li><li>Google</li><li>Mail</li><li>Notebook</li><li>Page Creator</li><li>Personalized Homepage</li></ul>Also I use the search and now the code search.<br /><br />And now I have just signed up for:<ul><li>Spreadsheets</li><li>Writely</li></ul>It&#8217;s great all these things are free and freely provided, but now I think I am getting too reliant on it all&#8230;  Admittedly I only use some of the things I am signed up to, and signed up to other things just to try them out.<br /><br />But I wasn&#8217;t going to discuss my addiction to trying things out.  Something occurred to me when I was looking at the new <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Office</a>, browsers are providing all this functionality, but we are still using an ancient paradigm.<br /><br />Microsoft are releasing Internet Explorer 7.0 very soon, and it is attempting to catch up with Firefox by adding features like tabbed browsing, but it is just playing catch-up to an idea that was born before all of the AJAX applications started leaping out of the woodwork.<br /><br />As these AJAX applications become more prevalent the web browser starts to become a hindrance.  Do you use multiple tabs or do you use multiple windows, and how do you arrange and manage those windows (especially since they all have the same taskbar icon)?  Are the bookmark user interfaces moving with the times?  The web browser needs a rethink for these new uses as it is still designed more for viewing static data (and now that is only part of its repetoire, a specialisation of its more generalised use).<br /><br />Most web browsers have their rendering engine a different layer, so that is easy to break out.  Do these applications become a separate window?  Do we get a new kind of application launcher?  I&#8217;ve never really put much thought into it as until recently I never saw the web as a platform.<br /><br />Certainly I am finding the current browser technology very limiting as tabbed browsing, multiple windows, bookmarks are not allowing me to use all of these new applications to their maximum potential.  Just having GMail and Blogger open in web browsers is harder than it should be to manage as I have to do a double take on the task bar or think before switching tabs.<br /><br />Maybe the web browser needs a rethink, or maybe my ideas aren&#8217;t so outlandish&#8230;  The main web browser application is some sort of navigator/task bar and the pages are shown in their own easily recognisable windows, perhaps even without borders as they currently exist.  I suppose some of these ideas are being integrated into these new &#8220;sidebars&#8221; in operating systems, but do they go far enough and take the new AJAX applications into account?</div>

<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> is the 800lb gorilla in the open source GUI toolkit arena.  It goes well beyond being simply about the GUI and spreads into all areas of application development, from networking to database to threading to strings.<br /><br />It isn&#8217;t such a large leap from MFC to wxWidgets.  They are born from the design of macros and simple classes, and this is not as large a problem as sometimes it is made out to be, some people find it easier, some find it harder.<br /><br />By far the easiest way to get up and running is to use <a href="http://wxpack.sourceforge.net/">wxPack</a> if you are using Visual Studio, or give <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org">Code::Blocks</a> a try.<br /><br />The sheer breadth and depth of the project is amazing, and it keeps spreading further with more and more contributions.  What I have noticed over the past year is that it has really started to take off with millions of additions like wxAUI (docking toolkit), wxFlatNoteBook (a tab control window container like Visual Studio has), wxPDFDocument, wxSQLite3, and in the past few days wxSkin (a potential skinning package).  The website is also much better with a <a href="http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/">wiki</a>, a <a href="http://wxforum.shadonet.com/">forum</a>, and this week a <a href="http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.  Google Summer of Code seems to have been a success for wxWidgets as well.<br /><br />I certainly have had some success with it writing a test program embedding an <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org">Ogre</a> rendering context into a docking user interface to try out wxAUI.  It looked impressive although didn&#8217;t accomplish much&#8230;<br /><br />Before making this post too long I will go into more depth in wxWidgets another time.</div>

<a href="http://www.torjo.com/win32gui/">Win32GUI Generics Homepage</a><br /><br />When I found this project I thought I had found the holy grail.  An advanced use of C++ for user interface purposes.  I looked past the screenshots on the website which seemed odd, but downloaded it anyway.  The last release of the project and any active development was nearly a year ago.<br /><br />It certainly pressed all the right buttons for me.  It was a wrapper for the Win32 API with aspirations to be cross-platform.  I encountered my first set of problems when I tried to get it to compile, you shouldn&#8217;t use the solution files for Visual Studio.  There is a &#8220;build library&#8221; utility that works with Visual C++ 8.0.  I got a few examples up and running with minor project file tweaks like include directories, and found that custom draw buttons were not XP themed so I hacked in a small theming API.<br /><br />All seems okay so far.  The biggest problem I found was the resizing, it caused massive amounts of flicker.  Having solved a lot of similar problems in MFC I tried to get it to flicker less with no success.  Then attempting lots of other examples I found they simply crashed or would not compile.  Most disappointing was I could not have a look at the new &#8220;Surfaces&#8221; version of the library.<br /><br />The compiled size of the library is massive with large amounts of global static data.  I found building a bit pot-luck.  I had to configure the Boost Jam files to not use iterator debugging or safe iterators.<br /><br />The thing is I really like this library and it seems really powerful, but simultaneously lacks a little robustness.  There is a lot of work to be done on this library to make it ready for the primetime which is really unfortunate.  John Torjo definitely deserves a pint of beer for fantastic and thought provoking work.<br /><br />There is a great little article about it <a href="http://blog.davber.com/2006/07/10/win32-for-real-c-developers/">here</a>.</div>

At work, I only use MFC and the antiquated design features in Visual Studio for working on resources.  These interfaces still feel like they haven&#8217;t moved on for a lifetime (and are in fact pretty much unchanged from Visual Studio 6.0).<br /><br />The most annoying part about working with the resources is I have to resort to handcoding most of the time.  It is especially necessary in order to follow the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch14e.asp">Official Guidelines for User Interface Developers and Designers</a> (self-inflicted myself, but you need some level of consistency).  Also the IDE design features have an uncanny knack for orphaned <span style="font-style:italic;">#defines</span> and controls.<br /><br />MFC doesn&#8217;t really feel like an API as most of the stuff I want to do I end up having to subclass and write lots of specific code.  There are subclasses for just about every type of control, and in that a lot of it is direct access to the Win32 API.<br /><br />I must admit that I don&#8217;t have an intense hatred for MFC like a lot of developers.  It seems to serve its purpose well, and there are so many extensions and large applications built on it.  I don&#8217;t think Microsoft envisioned being unable to kill it off because it is used by too many applications.  It will still be developed and have some new &#8220;managed&#8221; features which strikes me as odd&#8230;  MFC is a thin wrapper around the Win32 API, but .NET is a wrapper around the Win32 API, so there would be a double level of indirection for these new features.<br /><br />A lot of people would love to migrate away from MFC, but they are too integrally tied into their applications.  The cause of that is normally the initial codebase grew from a small code-generated wizard application.  I know I would love to do move away from MFC, but it is first necessary to find a new GUI toolkit that is capable of doing every feature you have probably handcoded in extensions to MFC, or if you have to write the extensions yourself it is no more difficult to do than the first time you wrote it.<br /><br />That is part of the reason to really look in depth at GUI toolkits.  It is really necessary to find one that will allow the most active development by the virtue of being easy to pick up.  Also, the grass is not always greener on the other side.</div>

It is quite bizarre they have never tried to make any improvements to it ever, even when they deprecate bits it never actually provides a great improvement - it is pretty much the same as when it first appeared.<br /><br />In fact in SP1 Beta of VS2005 they put in some safe library work.  It manages to break MFC to the point of being unusable thanks to making the Recent Files List throwing an exception.</div>

It is unfortunate that Microsoft doesn&#8217;t bother to improve the GUI library in MFC. MFC programmers are forced to use unreliable third party code from forums like CodeProject and CodeGuru.</div>

One of the things I really want to check out over the next few weeks are open-source GUI toolkits.  There are quite a few to choose from and I tend to jump from camp-to-camp on a weekly basis as to which one I find the most interesting.<br /><br />Since I am using Visual C++ 2005 Express, the ones I try out fully will be tested and compiled (if indeed a successful compilation is possible) on that platform.<br /><br />The initial ones I have already had a good go at over the past few weeks are <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a>, <a href="http://www.vcf-online.org">Visual Component Framework (VCF)</a>, and <a href="http://www.torjo.com/win32gui/index.html">Win32GUI Generics</a>.  Some others I have been reading about are <a href="http://smartwin.sourceforge.net/">Smartwin++</a>, <a href="http://upp.sourceforge.net/">Ultimate++</a>, <a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a>, and <a href="http://www.fox-toolkit.org/">FOX</a>.<br /><br />Also I want to write up a bit more of a comprehensive howto on Boost Python, as I quite enjoyed playing around with that.</div>

Oh yeah, I remember looking at that and having a big problem wrapping my brain around it because of how big it was.  Certainly if it becomes the basis for their products it is one to watch.</div>

One more toolkit to check out in your GUI series. The Adobe Open Source libraries <br /><br />http://opensource.adobe.com/<br />http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=132417&ssid=10238<br /><br />They certainly use an overall approach that is different from what I am used to seeing.</div>

In as long as I can remember I have not been impressed with the incremental steps in hardware.  The last time I went <span style="font-style:italic;">&#8220;Ooooooh!&#8221;</span> was when I bought a Voodoo card for 3D graphics (it wasn&#8217;t even integrated into graphics cards at the time) for a Pention 200MMX.  The smoothness and difference in response was amazing.  I suppose the incremental steps all add up and the comparison with a few years ago is noticable, but nothing really blew my socks off.<br /><br />That was until we got a top of the range two processor (each with two cores) Core 2 Duo (Xeon).  Bloody hell, I have never seen such a leap in speed ever!  Operations that took days before now take hours, and even when it is a single process (we work on a full multithreading program) it has a massive performance gain in the order of 50%, and  there are three cores still left idle!<br /><br />I&#8217;ve always bought Athlon processors for my home PC builds mainly because they were cost-effective and powerful.  But I have broken with tradition and picked myself up a Core 2 Duo 6400 processor and a new motherboard (which has both AGP and PCI-Ex slots) from my Athlon XP 3200+.  For general websurfing I don&#8217;t notice any difference until I try to compile something.  I am currently compiling a 114 project solution in Visual Studio in the background whilst I am typing this and it is hammering through and took about five to ten minutes to do(!)<br /><br />All I can say is if you do development the Core 2 Duo processors really make a difference.</div>

A few posts ago I wrote up how to compile the Boost Library and also Boost::Python with Visual C++ 2005 Express.<br /><br />Boost::Python is a fantastic tool for binding your C++ functionality to the Python scripting language.  You just need to write some extra small templates to expose classes, functions and so on.<br /><br />One of the things that bothered me about Boost Python is the need to use <span style="font-style:italic;">bjam</span> to build the resulting <span style="font-style:italic;">.pyd</span> file.  It complicates it all quite a lot, especially if you have not been using bjam.exe to compile your project anyway&#8230;<br /><br />What I discovered with a little bit of experimentation is that the PYD file is just a DLL renamed(!)  And that seems to be it.  So if you compile your program into a DLL (with all the additional Boost::Python code) then you either change the extension or change the project settings for the output filename.</div>

In order to make my TortoiseSVN as useful as possible, I use some external tools to maximise productivity.  It took a while to find the right set up but I am happy with it now.<br /><br />For merging with a three-way diff when there are conflicks I found <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/">KDiff3</a>, which seems to not be considered as sexy or well-known as most other tools.  But it does the job admirably with plenty of powerful features.  Certainly it does not look fully Windows-native, but that should not put you off if you want to use this powerful tool, and after all it is very rare that Subversion wants me to do a three-way diff.<br /><br />For standard diffs I use <a href="http://winmerge.org/">WinMerge</a>.  Simply it is the best Windows based diff and merge tool I have ever used.  It is powerful and intuitive, but is unfortunately limited to two-way diffs.  If it did do the three-way diffs I would not be using KDiff3.<br /><br />For viewing patch files (unified diffs) I use <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a> which has nice highlighting, but it very rare that I will have a need to look at these patch files.<br /><br />After installing TortoiseSVN, install KDiff3 as it sets up your TortoiseSVN environment for you.  Then install WinMerge and choose <span style="font-style:italic;">&#8220;WinMergeU.exe&#8221;</span> as the diff viewer.  Then install Notepad2 and set it up as the unified diff viewer.  Doing it in this order means that you can let KDiff3&#8217;s installation set up the bindings, and then configure the other ones by had as KDiff3&#8217;s commandline isn&#8217;t overly simple for TortoiseSVN.</div>

Michael Dunn has posted anotehr Vista native API tutorial about <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/winfx/VGPowerMonitor.asp">monitoring the system&#8217;s power</a>.  It is obviously not as whizz-bang as the first tutorial, but this is excellent stuff as I hope it means C/C++ developers are going to have a real go at messing around with the native API.<br /><br />There is an excellent and massive post from <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/08/10/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-3-_1320_-The-Desktop-Window-Manager.aspx">Kenny Kerr available from this link</a>.  Make sure you check that out as well.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve now installed the Windows SDK (I think they call the Win32 API the Windows API now, but there is no definitive answer as Microsoft want to encourage people to use other technologies).</div>

I started by downloading the Windows SDK, which had a file extension <span style="font-style:italic;">.img</span>.  After a bit of <a href="http://www.google.com">Googling</a> I found out you can just change the extension to <span style="font-style:italic;">.iso</span>.<br /><br />Now it was time to burn it.  I found out that the ISO Burning Powertoy doesn&#8217;t work for DVDs.  The software with the DVD drive was so hatefully bad that it was unusable.<br /><br />So I searched out the burning engine from DVDDecrypter which has been split off by the developer after all the raids and legal ranglings.  Now it is called <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/">ImgBurn</a> and it was a case of choosing the ISO then hitting the big button to burn.  Oh, did I mention it was freeware as well?  Top notch stuff.</div>
