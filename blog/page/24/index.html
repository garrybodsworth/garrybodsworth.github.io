Today I finally got a chance to install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">msysgit</a> - the Git port for Windows using <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a>.<br /><br />I was extremely impressed with the painless install and the ease of integration (into the shell context menu and the commandline).  The installer size is a trim 8Mb so it is a quick download to try out.<br /><br />The main thing I have tried out at the moment is the newly functioning (for Windows) Subversion bridge.  The git-svn import seems fairly speedy even on Windows and works seamlessly.  It is interesting how efficiently the data gets stored inteh repository as well, and the possibility of reconstructing information that has been lost due to file moves and other lossy operations in Subversion.<br /><br />Git-GUI also works.  Obviously it does not look spiffy and shiny but presents the information you need, and access to the operations you need (on a basic level).<br /><br />I would say Git For Windows is very close to being &#8220;ready&#8221; and providing you are not in need of the more difficult corner cases it is ready for production use.  The guys working on it have done a great job.<br /><br />Now all we need is their version of TortoiseSVN to take off called <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/git-cheetah.git/">git-cheetah</a> (which probably is getting easier thanks to some of the Tortoises sharing code now to do with displaying overlays).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Git Is The New Unix</span><br /><br />There is a great article about what Git really means as a platform.  You can read it <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/apenwarr/diary/371.html">here</a>.<br /><br />This kind of opened my eyes to how Git differs from not only other source control systems, but other distributed source control systems.  I recommend giving it a quick read.</div>

Good to know that git works quite well on Windows &#8211; I&#8217;ve decided to try a distributed version control system, and one of the things that was preventing me from choosing git was its (lack of) Windows support.<BR/><BR/>The article you linked to is a great read, thanks. (By the way, it&#8217;s called &#8220;Git is the /next/ UNIX&#8221;, not &#8220;new&#8221;.)</div>

Lots of information has been revealed recently about possible future directions for GTK+.  There is a comprehensive article on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/reinventing-gtk.ars">ArsTechnica here</a>.<br /><br />Imendio, one of the active developers of GTK+ made a recent presentation you can see <a href="http://developer.imendio.com/sites/developer.imendio.com/files/gtk-hackfest-berlin2008.pdf">here</a>.  This outlines what they see as the future direction and release plans for GTK+ in the future, with more detail available in the <a href="http://developer.imendio.com/sites/developer.imendio.com/files/imendio-gtk-vision.pdf">position document</a>.  Essentially it involves taking it forward by having a clear roadmap to break the ABI which has been stable for a long time, but has limited leaps forward in development.<br /><br /><a href="http://ometer.com/">Havoc Pennington</a> had a proposal also, this is available <a href="http://docs.google.com/Present?docid=dgn6j4pg_50dw7wh6vt#0">here</a>.  His proposal did not necessarily overlap the Imendio one but involved using a scenegraph API for defining the UI.  He also suggests looking at the OpenGL based <a href="http://www.clutter-project.org/">Clutter</a> which uses a GObject API for its rich user interface experience.<br /><br />Some additional experimentation has been made with <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071028-making-linux-application-user-interfaces-richer-with-opengl.html">integrating OpenGL with GTK+</a>.  A lot of work has been done to try and keep GTK+ up to date with theming and transparency but it can look off the pace especially when attempting to mimic the look of a native platform.  Hopefully all these changes will improve the situation on push the GUI even further since Windows development tools seem to be pushing the &#8220;every application looks different&#8221; paradigm, Apple making iTunes look the same on all platforms and applications like Songbird using the same theme on all platforms (and still looking good).</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Disclaimer:</span> These are my interpretations of what I learnt from the talks rather than a transcription of what they said.  This means that I probably misheard and misinterpreted some parts which may be hazardous to your health.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.displaylink.com">DisplayLink</a> were very generous and allowed me to attend the ACCU 2008 conference this year.  I chose to go for Wednesday and Thursday&#8217;s talkhttp://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gifs, but next time I plan to attend the whole conference.  I thought I would present some thoughts on those talks I did attend.<br /><br />Overall it was well worth spending the time at the conference, meeting a variety of interesting people.  I know people always say you learn more in the bar afterwards but I would say there would have to be some pretty intense knowledge exchanges to beat the information I picked up over the two days.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Value Delivery For Agile Environments</span><br /><a href="http://www.gilb.com">Tom Gilb</a><br /><a href="http://www.gilb.com/community/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=169">Slides</a><br /><br />I can sum up the talk in three words &#8220;Measure Measure Measure&#8221;.  Tom Gilb used his keynote to explain EVO, an envelope framework to surround a smaller development-centric process, which was in this case Agile.  He sees Agile as deficient in that it is a development process geared for delivery, but less thought is put into what you actually deliver.<br /><br />The problem comes then with what do you measure, how you measure, and then how do you interpret those metrics.  By doing this and combining it with a fast deliverable methodology like Agile then you end up with constant iterations with feedback able to deal with the changing nature of the world (most probably defined by requirements).<br /><br />I felt that the talk had an implicit feeling of &#8220;How To Survive&#8221;.  You need to identify your stakeholders, the people that determine the success and failure of your project and make sure that the needs of the most important and influential ones are met.  If they like what you are doing by meeting and possibly exceeding their needs then you are more likely to gain extra resourcing as you are then seen as a successful group.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Bits And Mortar</span><br />Ric Parkin<br /><br />Like an extended episode of Grand Designs we were taken through an analysis of buildings.  Well, no not really, but some of the theories that we are using in computer science have been looked at before and not only recently, in a completely different problem domain, and this field is architecture (and the evolution of buildings).<br /><br />I&#8217;m not the world&#8217;s biggest fan of analogies because pedantics always want to poke holes in it and take it off course thus negating any benefit from using it.  I wish I never used analogies but I am like a lemming following everyone else.  Luckily there was a thoughtful audience and the core was suitably abstract to avoid those problems.<br /><br />The basis of the talk was the work of an architect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>.  He posited the theory of patterns which obviously directly relates to what engineers are doing right now, and in fact sometimes he doesn&#8217;t even refer to architecture and buildings.<br /><br />Due to my ignorance all of this was completely new to me, and I could take a lot away from the talk because a lot of the ideas of the evolution of a building (and therefore design) is directly applicable to the realm of computer science.  If you look at a building as a finished intransient product after it has been completed then you forget about the lifetime of the building and how it evolves much like a codebase.  Knowing when to rebuild or rip-down parts requires suitable knowledge of what you are doing and you can also apply patterns other people have proved to be successful subsequently.<br /><br />Unfortunately (for Ric) the talk will be forever remembered as the place he uttered in public &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind introducing bugs&#8221;.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Practical Multi-Threading</span><br /><a href="http://www.dietmar-kuehl.de/">Dietmar Kuehl</a><br /><br />This talk covered the basics of the new C++ standard.  It was a packed room so a lot of people are interested in this area.<br /><br />It certainly looks like writing multithreaded applications will be much less code in C++ than it has traditionally been.  I like the idea of getting more functionality for less code.  Items like condition variables will be supported in the C++ Standard Library.  There was also a brief part about some of the TR2 features (C++0x + 1) like futures which makes using concurrent processing of independent blocks of code even easier and simplifying the synchronisation.<br /><br />Also some of this will be helped even more by the lambda expressions as I can see some of the simple operations can be kicked off and calculated independently on a single line.<br /><br />Also there was some coverage of <a href="http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/">Intel&#8217;s Threading Building Blocks</a> which provides concurrent containers and also concurrent algorithms like parallel_for or parallel_reduce.  This all provides some higher level semantics for expressing the concepts of multiple threaded processing.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">When Good Architectures Go Bad</span><br /><a href="http://blog.software-acumen.com/">Mark Dalgarno</a><br /><br />This was more of an interactive session where people&#8217;s experiences fed directly into the talk, so it means each time you would hear a write-up about it there would be a different opinion.  Luckily my group had some interesting anecdotes.  I do wonder why we all stay working in computers if we suffer this much abuse(!)<br /><br />We used our experiences of the world to come up with examples of where the architecture had begun to &#8220;smell&#8221; and what this represented.  Then looking at case studies we attempted to identify and find potential solutions to eliminate these smells.  For my example of a system that had been going for a very long time through so many different platforms, teams, languages, I said to cancel it because it was not making enough money to warrant its existence.<br /><br />The most frightening solution to architectural decay which also came up at the SPA conference when Mark did it previously, was &#8220;Kill The Architect&#8221;.  I thought I was cynical(!)<br /><br />This was a talk where you got more out of it if you put more into it.  Hopefully Mark will put up some of the responses he got from the audience on his blog.  In fact he could probably write a very frightening book about it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Caging The Effects Monster: The Next Decade&#8217;s Big Challenge</span><br /><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/">Simon Peyton-Jones</a><br /><br />Unfortunately due to beer-and-lack-of-sleep-related circumstances I decided to close my eyes in a darkened room for the duration of this talk.  I did not feel too guilty as I had seen Simon&#8217;s talks for the <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">BCS SPA Cambridge meetings</a>.  I posted about that talk <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2008/03/spa-talks-continuous-integration-and.html">here</a>.<br /><br />The functional programming track at the ACCU Conference seemed to be really well attended and seems to have grabbed the imagination of a number of people.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Future Of Concurrency In C++</span><br /><a href="http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/">Anthony Williams</a><br /><a href="http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/files/future_of_concurrency.pdf">Slides</a><br /><br />This talk was hosted by the maintainer of the Boost.Threads library.  He went through some of the more complex parts of the upcoming C++0x and C++0x TR2 as well as what is available through Boost.Threads currently.<br /><br />One of my favourite parts of the entire thing is the concept of thread-local storage as a built-in keyword.  No more GetTLS and the suchlike.  I could immediately see a use of a static member of a class that is per-thread in order to create a memory allocator for STL containers which would allocate via only the thread&#8217;s heap.  If you know that some information is local to a single thread then you won&#8217;t have any memory contention (in the program - I am not thinking about the hardware or underlying implementation) to slow down the memory access.  You have to have a clear design and use of this though otherwise you could blow your program&#8217;s brains out, but also that design works very nicely with thread pools&#8230;<br /><br />Unfortunately some of the higher level concepts will take until probably the next standard TR2 to get to compilers.  Of note this will contain thread pools and futures.  Futures mean you can run a thread for a calculation and start it off in a single statement and thehttp://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gifn check the result after doing some more work and it will wait until the result is posted.  Also getting the result will then propogate any exceptions that had occurred on the calculation thread.<br /><br />The good thing is a large portion of the C++0x threading implementation is available through Boost.Threads thanks to Anthony&#8217;s sterling efforts for 1.35, so you can always have a play.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Adobe Source Libraries : Overview And Philosophy</span><br /><a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/sean.parent/">Sean Parent</a><br /><a href="http://stlab.adobe.com/">Adobe Source Libraries (ASL) Open-Source</a><br /><a href="http://stlab.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Papers_and_Presentations">Lots of interesting papers and articles</a><br /><a href="http://www.stepanovpapers.com/">Alexander Stepanov&#8217;s collection of papers, articles and presentations</a><br /><br />I can think of worse things to be remembered for but I hope that Sean Parent is not only thought of as Alexander Stepanov&#8217;s boss.  He heads up the Software Technologies Lab at Adobe that create generic libraries that are used in all Adobe&#8217;s products.  This talk was divided into two sections, one concentrating on the data structures and generic programming, and the other about declarative UI.<br /><br />A very interesting part of the talk is the way he said he was using Alexander Stepanov&#8217;s skills, he basically said &#8220;Write a book defining generic programming&#8221;.  The research for this has lead to lots of leaps forwards for Adobe&#8217;s programming technologies.  Also he said that Stepanov gives lectures to the Adobe programming staff to improve their education.<br /><br />This talk started a little above my head by defining Regular Types which is very similar to the definitions and rules for what can be derived for functional programming except you can have side-effects.  This then provides the basis for generic programming.<br /><br />We had a close look at the ideas behind the Move library currently maintained by Adobe but could go (back) into Boost.  This library uses Return Value Optimisation to minimise and eliminate copies, and I was surprised to learn this was through the use of passing by value rather than by reference.<br /><br />There was also a look at the copy_on_write functionality which meant the object is only copied when it is written to and it uses the move library as part of its basis.  This also provides the platform for Adobe&#8217;s history tool in Photoshop and minimises memory impact.  Then there was a look at the Forest container which approaches the binary tree in a very tidy way.  Also they have a string library that uses the move library so concatenations are much more efficient.<br /><br />They are the right tools to solve certain datatype problems in a very concise and efficient fashion.  But the idea behind it all is to only use small pieces of code as building blocks towards the larger solutions.  What they want to do is reduce the number of lines of code declaring the applications by a very large factor (like from 3 million to 30,000).<br /><br />The second half of the talk was based around declarative UI and the structures Adobe have put in place to solve problems that still exist to this day.  I&#8217;ve looked at the two main libraries that make this up before called Adam and Eve, where both really amount to being constraint solvers, one solving the data and one solving the layout.<br /><br />The layout library is probably the simplest to explain as it works out from the size algorithms you provide the layout that follows the guides that have been set up.  This also means that it can scale the layouts with relative ease.  The scripting language is used to define the layout called Eve.<br /><br />The property library is used to solve data dependencies (a lot of which are typically cyclic) for user interfaces.  I have used something similar but much more simplistic in the past because it keeps the data separate from the UI itself.  This also means that you can script the operations.<br /><br />The papers and documentation on the Adobe site can probably explain all this much better then I ever could, but they are al interesting building blocks for solutions to some overlooked problems.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the talk especially the first half as it was a bit eye opening their practical approach to implementing generic programming with real benefits.  Unfortunately the talk was really badly attended considering both halves were up against some tough competition (especially about functional programming), but hey they all missed out on some really good stuff.</div>

Something work related for a change&#8230;  As you can see from my profile I work for <a href="http://www.displaylink.com">DisplayLink</a> where we make USB display technology.  Most people can&#8217;t believe that it will be very good, but whenever anyone sees one of our docks or adapters in action are impressed by the quality and the ease of use.<br /><br />Here at <a href="http://www.displaylink.com">DisplayLink</a> we have just released the Beta version of our Mac OSX software.  This means you can now use our USB displays on Mac - which I imagine could be very nice for the MacBook Air if the monitor has an integrated USB hub.<br /><br />You can get the Beta drivers <a href="http://www.displaylink.com/mac_beta_drivers.html">here</a>.  The general download page is <a href="http://www.displaylink.com/downloads.html">here</a>.  The Mac team have done a great job on this and it looks very impressive when you see it going.  As it is a beta it is not perfect, but it is very functional and robust.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve installed it on my MacBook Pro now, but I forgot to bring anything home to actually test it - duh!</div>

There is an interesting <a href="http://www.ddj.com/cpp/207000124;jsessionid=W2ECYFA310PC2QSNDLOSKHSCJUNN2JVN?_requestid=444830">interview with Bjarne Stroustrop on DDJ</a>.  It covers mainly how to train people in C++ and the future of C++.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the entire interview is the bit about the ISO standard committee and how it all works.  People seem to complain C++ doesn&#8217;t move fast enough (although the same people also complain there is too much as well).  What interested me is that it is lacking in funds.  Now I am pretty sure that every software company in the world has some C++ to varying degrees with most of them being critical to the company itself.  Yet, there is no funding or involvement in what is an open process for the language, the most I have seen by some is some people write one of those whitepapers (for instance the EASTL) and then chuck it into the ether.  It looks like it is a lot of hard work to really be serious about and to succeed at improving the language, and even Microsoft couldn&#8217;t succeed in circumventing the process.<br /><br />I know this could be considered pot calling the kettle black because I have no involvement and nor does my employer(or my previous employers), but I am still fresh at knowing exactly what is going on (even at the age of 30!).<br /><br />I suppose in an ideal world there would be less Not-Invented-Here (NIH) Syndrome and more participation in helping to improve the libraries and the core language.  I am not saying though that the people who use it are to blame as the committee should really have some form of outreach better than they currently have.  Boost is being moderately successful in its outreach which is helped by the mailing lists/forums and website as well as participating in things like the Google Summer Of Code.  Just imagine if the C++ Standards Committee could get the talented top 1% of C++ developers involved&#8230;  As developers we could help shape the future of the language and provide real solutions, which is more than could be said for something that is commercially controlled (even if it is published as an open standard).</div>

A new version of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost Library</a> for C++ has been released.  Version 1.35 adds 12 new libraries as well as the usual improvements and bugfixes.  Also there is a new look website which is a nice looking refinement with better access to the documentation.  Boost is a great addition to any C++ developer&#8217;s armament.<br /><br />I think this is also the first release using all their new tools and processes (Subversion, Trac, website and other stuff) so I think it is possible that future releases will be more frequent with this framework in place, because I think the plan was originally to have a release twice a year.  That might mean there is a possibility of the logging library by <a href="http://www.torjo.com">John Torjo</a> being integrated soon as well as some others.<br /><br />Some of the work brings the current libraries in line with the new C++ TR1 library standard - mainly to do with threads.<br /><br />The new libraries are:<br /><h3><span class="link"></span></h3><ul><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/asio/index.html">Asio</a>:</span> Portable networking,         including sockets, timers, hostname resolution and socket iostreams, from         Chris Kohlhoff.       </li><li><span class="library"><a href="http://boost.org/libs/bimap/index.html">Bimap</a>:</span> Boost.Bimap is a         bidirectional maps library for C++.

There is a CMake build system available but not &#8220;official&#8221;.<BR/><BR/>http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/CMakeConfigAndBuild<BR/><BR/>That might be a bit better.</div>

Boost 1.35 appears to be a big step (especially the networking module), but I cannot not get it to compile universal libraries or static libraries yet. Disappointing to say the least. I wish they used a less opaque build system so I could figure out how to hack it and make it work.</div>

There is no official release date for Subversion 1.5 although Alpha 2 is currently available.  I thought I&#8217;d post about the upcoming features that will be making their way into the release.  there is also a little bit at the end about TortoiseSVN 1.5 features.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Merge Tracking</span><br /><br />The most important feature in the upcoming 1.5.  The initial concept is based on svnmerge.py but has gone far beyond that and is fully integrated into the repository format.  This means it will be possible to see which revisions have yet to be merged or have already been done.  For people with complex branching or regular merging it should be an indispensable feature.<br /><br />Interesting links about it are <a href="http://blogs.open.collab.net/svn/2007/05/the_subversion__1.html">here</a>, <a href="http://blogs.open.collab.net/svn/2007/11/what-about-bran.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.open.collab.net/svn/2007/11/branching-strat.html">here</a>.  The functional spec is available <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/merge-tracking/func-spec.html">here</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Sparse Checkouts</span><br /><br />This allows for checking out portions of a larger repository.  This means it is possible to specify the depth that the operations take into the directory structure.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Conflict Resolution</span><br /><br />There are improvements to the conflict resolution for merges.  It is now possible to use the command-line to perform the resolution and a better interface for graphical clients.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Changelists</span><br /><br />It is possible to work on several sets of files on a single working copy.  You can associate those files together with a name in order to work on more than one problem in a single working copy.  I really needed this feature at work today trying to do more than one thing in a single working copy.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Externals Improvements</span><br /><br />The improvements allow svn:externals to be pegged at a revision.  Also they can use relative paths from the current directory (that will be really good in some instances with external deliverables) and if you use externals it makes managing a code tree much easier because it treats it like it is part of the current code tree.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Copy/Rename Improvements</span><br /><br />There is an improvement in the behaviour on copy/renaming of files (not currently directories until version 1.6) by the client trying to be smarter.  If a file has been renamed/copied then rather than the server sending the whole new file it does the copy operation so you should not lose the changes that had been made to the old file.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">TortoiseSVN 1.5</span><br /><br />This should be released not long after the main Subversion 1.5 release.  The major changes will be the user interface work for merge tracking, changesets, and sparse checkouts.  There are some other features that will be part of the 1.5 release:<br />* Client side hook scripts – You can run some scripts before or after committing - this should help people create better processes.<br />* If a program has done some file operations like renaming and deleting without using the Subversion interface (drag-right-click) then it is possible to fix the file relationships in the UI.  This would be quite useful to inte3grate as an external tool in Visual Studio.<br />* Repository browser now has a two pane look like Windows Explorer with a tree-view and list of files.  Apparently it is much faster.<br />* A new merge wizard rather than the dialog which improves the workflow for merging.</div>

GTK+ is used by a large variety of programs on a decent number of platforms.  It doesn&#8217;t have the best reputation for certain bits and pieces, some fairly, some unfairly.<br /><br />Discussions have begun on what will be the new version of GTK+ 3.0.  The most important news is that they will be able to break the ABI which they have heroically maintained all through the 2.0 releases, this should mean lots of good stuff now they are let off the leash.<br /><br />You can check out the start at this <a href="http://federkiel.wordpress.com/2008/03/12/gtk-30-getting-serious/">blog post</a>.<br /><br />The touchstones for the GUI toolkit will be to improve the theming abilities (which in theory will improve look and feel cross platform), animations for swishy interfaces, and proper canvas widget/window.  It will be remaining C which is excellent news for the millions of easy language bindings.<br /><br />It should be interesting to see what happens, hopefully only concentrating on the GUI rather than a lot of the other toolkits which are a bit &#8220;kitchen sink&#8221; will do for it.</div>

Now I am 30 I can get away with saying things were so much better in the olden days.  Actually, no that is not even vaguely true, there is always probably the same good to crap ratio, but the marketing of the crap means you have to dig a little deeper and smarter.<br /><br />Anyway in the olden days Lucasarts the gaming arm of all things Star Wars was actually astoundingly good at making games.  They had the best and brightest and created some of the most unforgettable experiences a person could have on their computer.  Their adventure games were masterclasses for scripting and game echanics.<br /><br />Anyway on to the point of this post - some linkage - two great articles about Lucsart classics, from the very beginning and the very end of their work in adventure games:<br />* <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_139/2994-Walk-Don-t-Run">Grim Fandango</a> - Walk Don&#8217;t Run<br />* <a href="http://www.mixnmojo.com/features/read.php?article=maniacmansion">Maniac Mansion</a> - Lucasarts Secret history<br /><br />And also another completely unrelated gaming article is the excellent retrospective of a game developer starting his commercial career with Donkey Kong on the Atari platform.

<div class="post-content"><div class='post'>
In the space of two weeks there have been two <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">BCS SPA Cambridge</a> talks organised by <a href="http://blog.software-acumen.com/">Mark Dalgarno</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/ContinuousIntegration">Continuous Integration</a> by <a href="http://oocode.com/">Ivan Moore</a><br /><br />The second talk by Ivan Moore after his interactive talk about Test-Drive-Development (which was a crash course on Java as well).  This time it was not as interactive but just as practical.  In addition to the slides he actually demonstrated his own continuous integration system (available from Sourceforge) <a href="http://build-o-matic.sourceforge.net/">build-o-matic</a>.  It has some interesting features like pictures to show the guilty parties when thebuild or tests break.  It also is quite a simple build system which means you can more or less build anything with it.<br /><br />He was preaching to the converted as most of the audience were practicing continuous integration anyway.  I think the main lesson to take away from the talk is to not compromise at any point on the builds or the tests even in with a heavy workload.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/TypeDrivenTestingInHaskell">Type Driven Development in Haskell</a> by <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/">Simon Peyton-Jones</a><br /><br />This talk was really about how to write more robust programs in functional programming.  The talk involved more of a discussion of functional languages and their benefits as well as how to write tests that more define the concepts and rules for inputs and the outputs.<br /><br />Mostly the testing part reminded me of the static assertions that are available in the C++ Boost Library.  I think that there must be a bridge to utilise more aspects of functional programming in a library like fashion because of the interesting optimisations that can be made.  Also mathematical correctness is a bonus.<br /><br />The lecture itself was interesting and certainly animated.  The sign of a good talk is that it makes you think, and I am certainly thinking about functional languages and their applications (after all templates can be used in that fashion but it does put a lot of strain on the compiler). I can certainly see some useful applications in the field of CAD/CAM - shame I left hat field&#8230;</div>
