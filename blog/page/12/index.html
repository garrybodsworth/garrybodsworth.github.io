    The BCS SPA Cambridge talks are about to start again running monthly from November through to June. These are computing talks that are free to attend with a light buffet. The talks are also moving back to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge">Microsoft Research Cambridge</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On November 12th at 7pm <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.software-acumen.com/">Mark Dalgarno</a> is doing his talk <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/WhenGoodArchitectureGoesBad">“When Good Architectures Go Bad”</a>.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      As software evolves its architecture ‘as-is’ deviates from its architecture ‘as-hoped-for’ – the software is said to erode.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Software Erosion can be a problem because:<br /> - the time, effort and risk in implementing further changes increases
    </p>
    
    <p>
      - the effect of further changes becomes harder to predict<br /> - further changes typically cause the ‘as-is’ architecture to deviate further from the ‘as-hoped-for’ architecture – the situation becomes worse.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This session looks at examples of software erosion and explores practices to prevent or slow such decay. Participants should come prepared with architectural ‘war stories’. There will be a couple of group exercises but no test at the end.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    This will be a good session to meet other attendees and to tell your war stories and stories of hope (although I think the bad ones are always more entertaining).

<div class="post-content"><p>This month <a href="http://www.boost.org/users/news/version_1_37_0">Boost 1.37 has been released</a>. It&#8217;s the latest version of the extremely useful peer reviewed C++ libraries that a large portion of has fed into the latest C++ standards.</p>

<p>There is only one new library this time out which is Boost.Proto:</p>

<blockquote><p>Proto is a framework for building Domain Specific Embedded Languages in C++. It provides tools for constructing, type-checking, transforming and executing expression templates. More specifically, Proto provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>An expression tree data structure.</li>
<li>A mechanism for giving expressions additional behaviors and members.</li>
<li>Operator overloads for building the tree from an expression.</li>
<li>Utilities for defining the grammar to which an expression must conform.</li>
<li>An extensible mechanism for immediately executing an expression template.</li>
<li>An extensible set of tree transformations to apply to expression trees.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There are the usual myriad of bug fixes with the other libraries. They are still following their regular release cycles which is a good thing.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>It has been a while since I have said anything about upcoming talks in Cambridge.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cambridgebusinesslectures.com/">The original Apprentice is coming to town &#8211; Cambridge Business Lectures</a><br/>
<strong>10th November 2008 5.30pm</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Tim Campbell, the winner of the first series of The Apprentice, is coming to Cambridge. Tim will talking on “Much sugar is a good thing: the power of mentoring”.</p>

<p>Tim stands out from other Apprentice contestants &#8211; and winners &#8211; as being a man of substance and depth as well as charisma. Since leaving Amstrad, he’s set up two ventures. Most recently, his Bright Ideas Trust gives advice and funding to young people to help them get their ideas off the ground.</p>

<p>Tim will be talking at Robinson College, Cambridge at 5:30pm on Monday November 10th. The event is free, but you need to <a href="http://www.regonline.co.uk/Checkin.asp?EventId=655098">book a place</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m really interested to see what life after what essentially amounts to a &#8220;reaity&#8221; TV programme is like, because it sounds like he has accomplished some really good things. Unfortunately his era at Amstrad was recent so I guess no questions about the CPC464&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.software-east.co.uk/">Software East</a><br/>
<strong>20th November 2008 7pm</strong></p>

<p>There are two speakers for this event:</p>

<ul>
<li>Steven Kelly &#8211; Moving from Coding to Model-Driven Development</li>
<li>Danilo Beuche &#8211; Get started with Software Product Lines &#8211; Key success factors and what to avoid</li>
</ul>


<p>The cost of this event is £15 which includes light buffet.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>There is a restaurant in London called Inamo where you get to order your food by interacting with your tablecloth. Overhead projectors display your tablecloth and table information and you use a little touchpad like device to interact with the services in the restaurant. You place your orders and can even play games all through the interface.</p>

<p>This is the user interface &#8211; the large circle is used to move the pointer and the small one acts like a button, although tapping the main one also does the same.<br/>

<div class="post-content"><p>I have been running a VM of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/intrepid/beta">Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex</a> for a few days now. I am not overly enamoured by the default theme, mainly the blandness and the window padding which since using my Mac I know is an unnecessary luxury (also to make Vista more manageable make sure you get rid of the crazy 4 pixel window padding).</p>

<p>I decided to use the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/DustTheme">Dust theme</a> because it is understated, looks clean and by default using no window padding. The main bonus is that there is a Firefox theme as well, and as I spend most of my life with open web browsers it deals with that minor niggle of consistency. The screenshots that you will see by following the above link will show you it is well thought out.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5064515/ubuntu-810-gets-optional-darkroom-theme">Lifehacker have posted today</a> there is a new theme called DarkRoom with Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex. It&#8217;s basically a dark (brown) theme. From the screenshots it looks nice and leathery but nowhere near as nice as the Dust theme. I can&#8217;t seem to find if it skins Firefox but since it is an official skin I imagine it must.</p>
