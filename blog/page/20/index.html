<div class="post-content"><p>I am still cleansing my body after escaping the confines of Visual Studio, hence the post about &#8220;regressing&#8221; (although in hindsight it is the wrong word, perhaps progressing is better).</p>

<p>I am now having to do development in Python on a Mac (personal choice), and this leaves me with a variety of dilemmas. For a start I have never coded in anger on Python but it seems fairly easy to grok and pick up.</p>

<p>My first dilemma is what do I edit my files in&#8230; I have played around with four choices so far.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a><br/>
This was my first port of call because I have used it before. It also has the plug-in <a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/">PyDev</a> which provides autocomplete and other niceties beyond syntax highlighting. I have ony begun to scratch the surface of the system, mainly because there is so much and it is presented right from the start rather than starting simple then gradually adding features. Since I was only evaluating I chose the free version of PyDev but it started popping up regular dialogs to remind me there is a paying version which kind of annoyed me.</p>

<p><a href="http://smultron.sourceforge.net/">Smultron</a><br/>
A nice and simple text editor which provides syntax highlighting for Python (although it doesn&#8217;t get the three double-quote comments correct). I like it, but you have to open the files in order to edit them rather than having an interface onto the file system to speed up the process. You can create a project to simplify it, but it requires some upfront work.</p>

<p><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a><br/>
The de-facto standard for editing files on the Mac. The feature I like the most is the project side tray. Drop a folder onto it and you can access the file system for that folder to your hearts content which is really helpful when traversing lots of files. It is also very configurable but I don&#8217;t think I have even scratched the surface yet.</p>

<p><a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs Emacs</a><br/>
Certain people I have had the pleasure of working with in my career are part of the elite Emacs Users Group, it is a top secret organisation based on open-source where with a few touches of a keyboard they can probably bring about some kind of world-spanning event. Aquamacs is the best Mac version of the editor I found and I have been playing with a small amount. For an emacs it does not look out of place on the Apple desktop, and it is obviously still the most configurable tool on the planet. If I can get myself up and running on this I reckon it will probably be a contender. Also, version 1.4 has just been released.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Try to buy a mobile phone for anyone with visual impairment. It&#8217;s not easy.</p>

<p>What you want is a mobile phone that is simple and clear to use. Unfortunately those beasts do not exist. On the <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/">RNIB</a> website you can go to their shop and see the <a href="http://onlineshop.rnib.org.uk/browse.asp?n=11&amp;c=59&amp;sc=0&amp;it=1&amp;l=2">few available</a>. They are not of the quality you usually see in mass produced phones, but they are expensive in the grand scheme of things (obviously missing out on economies of scale and not being made by the large players in the mobile market).</p>

<p>When I was looking I looked at all the major manufacturer websites for options that are more accessible and they did have pages on their site suggesting the best models for it. Unfortunately those models were typically so old they were discontinued, and every model that was suggested was totally unsuitable. I think also when people think of the blind they think of complete visual loss which is actually more rare than being visually impaired enough to be registered blind, so large and clear items can work for the blind.</p>

<p>In the end out of the options the <a href="http://www.emporialifeplus.com/">Emporia Life Plus</a> was the least bad option. The buttons and display are fairly large and clear, definitely much more so than every mainstream phone handset. The phone is actually designed for the elderly with a bright red button on the back to hit in case of emergencies, so its applicability for someone with visual impairment is only a side-effect.</p>

<p>I think this is a failure of simple user interface design. Part of the reason I steered clear of mobile phones for several years is that as they added more features to their checklist, those features weren&#8217;t very nice to use. Actually I just found an <a href="http://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/index.html">iPhone page for accessibility</a> which is a start. I suppose some people are not too sure because of the lack of tactile feedback so I suppose this is where audio feedback becomes very important and where someone able to set it up in the best way possible comes in. There is also a <a href="http://images.apple.com/accessibility/pdf/iPhone_3G_vpat.pdf">pdf with more iPhone details</a> here.</p>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_Nokia_Launches_N82_Smartphone_For_Visually_Impaired_13350.html">Nokia N82 smartphone</a> and just from the image you can see the buttons are completely unsuitable. It&#8217;s principal technology is that it scans and reads documents for the blind (and email, etc) which is all well and good but the complete package doesn&#8217;t address every need. It&#8217;s a gadget to help the completely blind in general rather than allowing the visually impaired to make good use of their mobile phone (or as it is nowadays a mobile computer).</p>

<p>It would be very interesting for a study on how to improve interfaces for visual impairment because if nothing happens and more goes mobile/online you end up with a surprising number of people left out of the loop. Even a study of the audio, tactile and visual elements would be an enlightening proposition to help take a step forward in understanding.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>On my home Mac I have been using <a href="http://porticus.alittledrop.com/">Porticus</a> to manage packages from <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>. What I discovered today installing packages for work (a fair few) was that about halfway through the day I had reverted entirely to the commandline and I don&#8217;t particularly know how or why but I was a hell of a lot faster at it.</p>

<p>After working in Windows which I have found commandline avoidable. It doesn&#8217;t really work when you are installing lots of programs (each one installs differently, MSIs, copying, and who knows what) and trying to script a system (without reverting to something like cygwin).</p>

<p>As I head down the road of the commandline I realised that I don&#8217;t know enough shortcuts so I&#8217;m going to have to learn more of them to accomplish tasks faster. I think soon I&#8217;ll be using emacs full time&#8230;</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>This evening I attended a <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">Cory Doctorow</a> talk in Cambridge hosted by <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">Cambridge Business Lectures</a>. The lecture being about:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Cory Doctorow on Life in the Information Economy</strong></p>

<p>We made a bet, some decades ago, that the information economy would be based on buying and selling (and hence restricting copying of) information. We were totally, 100 percent wrong, and now the world’s in turmoil because of it. What does a copy-native economy look like? How do everyone from barbers to musicians become richer, more fulfilled and more civilly engaged in a real information society. And what do we do about the fact that a couple of dinosauric entertainment companies are determined to screw it up?</p>

<p>Cory Doctorow is a blogger, science fiction writer and journalist. He is an editor of Boing Boing, the 11th best blog in the world (according to Time Magazine). He was the 2006-2007 Canadian Fulbright Chair in Public Diplomacy at the USC Center on Public Diplomacy. He founded the software company Opencola which was later sold to the Open Text Corporation. He also writes regularly for The Guardian newspaper</p></blockquote>

<p>All I can say is &#8220;Wow&#8221;. I&#8217;ve never heard anyone speak so fast for so long with so much content. In an hour he covered DRM, three strikes and your out, criminalisation of the customer, and much more. He concentrated also on the strengths of the Internet and not fighting against them one of which being the ability to form strong groups.</p>

<p>The best part is that he offers solutions not just problems, even his own content he generates, blogs, lectures, books, graphic novels, is available under Creative Commons. In the question and answers session he provide excellent answers, especially about software developers in this brave new world.</p>

<p>There was so much content that I think it is going to take a few days for my brain to process it all&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure there will be a video or audio file available online soon so I will update this post with that link then. In the meantime here is a <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/CoryDoctorowsFuturisticTalesOfTheHereAndNow">link to his graphic novel</a> featuring adaptations of his short stories available for free.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I stumbled across <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iui/">iUI</a> this weekend. It provides a UI for developing iPhone applications that run in MobileSafari that look the same as native iPhone applications.</p>

<p>It provides the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create Navigational Menus and iPhone interfaces from standard HTML.</li>
<li>Use or knowledge of JavaScript is not required to create basic iPhone pages.</li>
<li>Ability to handle phone orientation changes.</li>
<li>Provide a more &#8220;iPhone-like&#8221; experience to Web apps (on or off the iPhone).</li>
</ul>


<p>There is a great introduction blog post from Hoe Hewitt <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/introducing_iui.php">here</a>. The library provides all the building blocks to get started quickly with some spiffing looking iPhone specific webpages.</p>

<p>On the project page there is a couple of examples including a <a href="http://iui.googlecode.com/svn/tags/REL-current/samples/digg/index.html#___1__">Digg Interface</a> and a <a href="http://iui.googlecode.com/svn/tags/REL-current/samples/music.html#_home">music UI sample</a>.</p>
