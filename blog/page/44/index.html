At work we do code reviews as part of our development process.  This means every commit has to have an additional set of eyes go over it and confirm the edits are good and adhere to the coding standards.<br /><br />This can be an intrusive process, but also can be priceless.  The creator of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> Guido van Rossum has developed a code review system whilst working for Google.  The system is called Mondrian and there is some more information <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/11/google-mondrian.html">here on a blog interview</a>.  Currently it uses Perforce but in order for it to be released as open-source it will also work for Subversion and different database backends.</div>

One thing I have been continually sidetracked from sorting out recently is menus for Windows Vista.<br /><br />Currently we use DrawItem() and MeasureItem() to custom draw the menu items so that they have icons next to the items.  Unfortunately on Vista the custom drawing of the base implementation of DrawItem() simply does not look right under Vista.  It utilises the solid dark blue bar when you hover the mouse and the spacings look odd, and this is the default implementation.  Also, the background colour is a little darker and the disabled text does not look very good.  Without the custom draw functions it integrates much better in Vista, but I need to finish implementing some code for the associated icons.<br /><br />So, I was using Windows Explorer under Vista and realised the context menus have EXACTLY the same problem.  This is just completely insane, they obviously implemented the functionality in exactly the same way, but the underlying Windows API could not have been updated for this.</div>

A few days ago I mentioned the <a <br />href=&#8221;http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/11/windows-vista-new-start-menu.html&#8221;>Windows Start Menu mess</a>.  I simply wasn&#8217;t impressed by it (you can also see the link to the Joel on Software blog post about it).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.drizzle.com/~lettvin/2006/11/windows-shutdown-crapfest.html">Apparently 24 developers got their hands dirty working on this</a>, and it still turned out the way it has.  I still look at the menu that pops up with the restart, etc. and wonder who let it out the door as it is a simple pop-up menu, not really revolutionary, and it doesn&#8217;t even have associated icons.<br /><br />All I can say about the turning off scenario is most people know what to do with a TV or DVD player, why is not that simple?</div>

In my job I develop CAM (Computer Aided Machining) software.  To be honest there are very few decent resources on the web for it and it is a very closed development arena.<br /><br />There are some people out there trying to change this.  There are two developers (who I used to work with) called Julian Todd and Martin Dunschen who believe in open-ness in development.  They have a great little blog <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/index.php">here</a>.  You can also try out the online version of their <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/">machining algorithm</a>.</div>

It&#8217;s not often a thread on GUI programming comes up on <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> but there is one <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/11/25/205243">here</a>.  There are probably some useful links in the comments if you dig enough.<br /><br />I dunno, it strikes me there is a lack of discussion about GUIs in general compared to other programming subjects, possibly due to entrenched positions about what everyone personally sees as &#8220;best&#8221;.</div>

I finally got to the bottom of my outstanding OpenGL problem on Vista.  It seems that the drivers were throwing floating point exceptions in random places, I tidied up the code as much as possible but it still happened.  The only way to get around this problem was to not unmask the floating point exceptions in the thread performing the OpenGL rendering (although most applications seem not to unmask floating point exceptions as I have discovered).<br /><br />I imagine when the drivers are as mature as the XP drivers these will be but a distant memory, as in the olden days the way the OpenGL drivers handled exceptions was pretty random.<br /><br />One thing I want to reiterate is that OpenGL works seamlessly on Vista with the dwm Aero experience.  People still think they have to migrate away from OpenGL to DirectX/Direct3D, I cannot emphasise enough this is not the case.  I know some companies still haven&#8217;t managed to filter through that information, but it is the case and the computer I am using is evidence of that.<br /><br />So spread the word OpenGL is fully compatible and runs natively with Windows Vista!</div>

Sorry for the delay in replying.<br /><br />That phrase was the best terminology I could some up with.  What Microsoft originally said was it would only run through emulation or if you wanted full acceleration then you would have a compromised Windows graphical experience (only a metter of concern for non fullscreen applications).<br /><br />Anyway, they removed the artificial barrier for OpenGL (as the limitations were strategic not technical) so that you canrun hardware accelerated OpenGL with minimal abstraction for the hardware without compromising the look of Windows Vista.  Microsoft would still prefer you to use DirectX/Direct3D though.</div>

Can you explain exactly what you mean by &#8220;runs natively with Windows Vista&#8221;?  Does the &#8220;Vista API&#8221; have OpenGL fcts. built into it?<br /><br />I guess I should dust off my copy of &#8220;Computer Graphics with OpenGL&#8221; that is collecting dust on my shelf.<br /><br />Cheers.</div>

In the recent past the perceived as slow-moving OpenGL ARB (Architecture Review Board) handed over the guidance of OpenGL to the <a href="http://www.khronos.org/">Kronos Group</a>.  The Kronos Group were responsible for the very popular OpenGL ES standard for embedded devices.<br /><br />Something that had completely bypassed me on the <a href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL website</a> was a new <a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/">Pipeline Newsletter</a> for the latest goings on in OpenGL land.  There are currently two volumes:<ul><li><a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/vol001">Volume 001</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/vol002">Volume 002</a></li></ul>In the first volume we are introduced to the OpenGL Ecosystem Working Group which was formed in March 2006.  This group is going to do all the work as developers we will probably find most useful - examples, documentation, testing, etc.  Most interesting though is the thought of the OpenGL SDK which I will come back to.<br /><br />According to the second newsletter there will be two OpenGL specification releases in 2007, with a substantial restructuring of the object model.  Also there is some information about the work for OpenGL on other platforms.  Just the communication from these newsletters makes OpenGL seem much faster moving.<br /><br />But back to the OpenGL SDK.  As the Ecosystem Working Group put it, developers want a single SDK for OpenGL that is ratified by the ARB.  This would also contain the documentation and examples and more.  In the newsletter article <a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/article/vol002_2/">&#8220;One SDK To Rule Them All&#8221;</a> more detail is revealed.  If all goes to plan then this should be a very impressive start.  One part of particular interest is the suggestion there will be more to the SDK, with layers that abstract away platform specifics.  THis can only be a good thing - no need to reinvent the wheel.</div>

Well, that was easy.  OpenGL works seamlessly on a composited desktop with DWM.  I am using the nVidia QuadroFX drivers and it seems okay.<br /><br />Kind of anyway.  Performance is a little off, especially in debug, but this could be related to any number of things.  Also I am getting lots some weird crashes setting OpenGL colours, but that requires more investigation.<br /><br />Anyway, it was far from worst case scenario.</div>

Microsoft have announced the licensing behind the Office 2007 &#8220;ribbon-style&#8221; UI.  The weirdest thing is you are not licensing the source code, you are licensing the &#8220;ideas&#8221;.  It seems related to their current intellectual property surge (with their recent deal with Novell).<br /><br />The details are available from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/11/21/licensing-the-2007-microsoft-office-user-interface.aspx">Jensen Harris&#8217;s blog</a>.  The press release is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2006/nov06/11-21officeui.mspx">here</a>.  The details for the license are <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/office/aa973809.aspx">here</a>.<br /><br />What it amounts to is this:<br /><ul><li>You are allowed to copy the UI style.</li><li>No source code is supplied.</li><li>You are not allowed to use the style if the application is in direct competition to a Microsoft product already using it (ie, a word processor).</li><li>Essentially Microsoft have to sign off on your version.</li></ul>Here is a quote:<br /><blockquote>For those that want to build their own UI that takes advantage of our design guidelines, they will need a license.</blockquote>I&#8217;m not entirely sure how you would show that you did not follow their guidelines which are available in order to implement a similar interface.  And since the guidelines are available on the Internet it is impossible for it not to be found in Google searches and the suchlike.<br /><br />I&#8217;m sorry, but this is a backdoor way to legitimise the idea of software patents, where they are identified with some sort of fuzzy or not so fuzzy description of something that most probably has prior art.  I believe in the sharing of knowledge (this is not the same as sharing sourcecode necessarily).</div>

<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a> has a little post about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/21.html">&#8220;Choices = Headaches&#8221;</a> about UI design.<br /><br />It looks at the start menu and the number of choices to shut down a computer.  I personally was even more concerned about the bad design presenting it to the user (and to a lesser degree there were far too many options), in fact XP did it better.  I realise that there are lots of options, but initially I missed where <span style="font-style:italic;">Restart</span> was.<br /><br />Simply cutting down the number of options is not enough I feel, someone should have sat down and actually used the design that they have foisted on the user.</div>
