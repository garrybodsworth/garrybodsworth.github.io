Well, as it turns out the new features for MFC in Visual Studio 2008 are actually a license of the <a href="http://www.bcgsoft.com/">BCGSoft</a> interface toolkits.  I guess this might be similar to the deal with Dinkumware for the STL implementation that Microsoft license a version of and then bolt their own things into.  Obviously it is not as good as having the actual implementation used by Microsoft in their modern products (Office 2007) but it is a start.<br /><br />There is a thread on <a href="https://forum.codejock.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=8232">Codejock here</a> explaining some of the history.  I do agree with them that Codejock has looked better than BCGSoft when I evaluated them, but I suppose the tools that are free will always win out.  Also it explains the lack of ribbon designer integration, although it is amazing MS don&#8217;t have a pluggable back-end for the forms and ribbon designer.</div>

This morning I went to the <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/10/another-cambridge-talk-joel-spolsky.html">Joel On Software Fogbugz 6.0</a> talk that was hosted in Cambridge.  It was an interesting presentation on the new features and capabilities of Fogbugz with some nice little anecdotes dropped in for good measure.  Most of the time was spent on the new Evidence Based Scheduling feature which is quite nice and will help with estimation accuracy., taking some of the uncertainty away from that aspect of the development process.<br /><br />Fogbugz makes a good thanks to the AJAX interface, although I won&#8217;t say it looks awesome with the default skin.  The AJAX features certainly makes the user interface have less friction for use and has some nice touches to minimise clicking and the such. It would probably make even more sense as one of the Adobe AIR type apps to make it integrate into the desktop or something along those lines with gadgets.<br /><br />The thing that was lacking for me unless I am really weak with my Google searching is bug relationships.  You can create links to other bugs and they are listed in the bug report, but in systems like <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org">Bugzilla</a> you can have a rich relationship.  This means you can create dependency graphs and define the types of relationships.<br /><br />I&#8217;m afraid I would not recommend spending money on it for my situation.  It is a tool that works best for developers and in the development situation, and not a company-wide tool (unfortunately, although it could theoretically work), but I am all for making developers lives easier.  It is just I feel that if you have a technically adept development team then they will be capable of accomplishing the same goals with other tools.  This is especially necessary as most development teams can never get financial approval for new or better tools (unfortunately it is still what I hear from most people since most developers have given up asking).<br /><br />I suppose what I am getting round to saying is that if you are using Subversion or a supported version control system, you should try out <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>.  The integration between source control, wiki (documents), issues, and more are excellent (and it looks good).  It is a developer&#8217;s tool though rather than a forward facing tool for customers, but it will improve the development team&#8217;s workflow.  It can do more or less everything Fogbugz can do with the default install plus the whole host of <a href="http://trac-hacks.org/">Trac Hacks</a>.  I&#8217;ve <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/10/tools-to-make-developers-life-easier.html">blogged about this tool before</a>.<br /><br />I must admit I am a big fan of Bugzilla because the bug reporting system is so rich and configurable.  If it had the Subversion and plug-ins equivalent to Trac then it would be amazing.  As things stand though Trac does work a treat, hell even open-source projects are using Trac to host their websites like <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org">OpenSceneGraph</a>.</div>

If you like FogBugz, a free open source alternative that has a similar  approach is <A HREF="http://ifdefined.com/bugtrackernet.html" REL="nofollow">BugTracker.NET</A> (I&#8217;m the author).  <BR/><BR/>Actually both FogBugz and BugTracker.NET have good - and similar - <A HREF="http://ifdefined.com/doc_bug_tracker_subversion.html" REL="nofollow">Subversion integration</A>.<BR/><BR/>BugTracker.NET does support <A HREF="http://www.ifdefined.com/doc_bug_tracker_relationships.html" REL="nofollow">bug relationships</A> a bit more directly than FogBugz, but it probably falls short of what you described here.<BR/><BR/>No integrated Wiki (yet).</div>

I blogged a while back about the secret MFC features for VS2008 (MFC v9) <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/10/gui-toolkits-mfc-v9-visual-studio-2008.html">here</a>.  The information was going to appear at Microsoft Technet Europe 2007in a talk by Ale Contenti.<br /><br />Well, I think the talk must have now happened as there are a few posts out here on the Internet about it.<br /><br />You can read one <a href="http://blog.kalmbach-software.de/2007/11/07/mfcupdate-mfc-now-has-a-visual-manager-and-will-add-office-2007-ribbon-controls-and-many-more-features/">here</a> and another <a href="http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.m-ri.de%2Findex.php%2F2007%2F11%2F07%2Fmfc-updates-for-visual-studio-2008-and-beyond-mfcnext%2F&langpair=de|en&hl=en&ie=UTF8">translated here</a>.<br /><br />It amounts to lots of good stuff for native C++ developers on Windows:<br />* Docking windows<br />* Tabbed MDI<br />* Office 2007 theme<br />* Ribbon interface (no visual designer yet though)<br />* Lots of new controls<br />* Skins<br />* Vista specific enhancements<br />* And plenty more&#8230;<br /><br />I actually can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on this and have a play, unfortunately we do have to wait until next month for a release candidate as it will be an add-on.  The interesting thing is the visual styles manager which will allow switching visual styles at runtime.<br /><br />Apparently there will be a Channel 9 video soon that should appear <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showforum.aspx?forumid=14&tagid=17">here</a>.</div>

As the standard for the next version of C++ gets closer to being finalised, more details are emerging.  In October was the Kona meeting for the C++ committee and you can read about it <a href="http://herbsutter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!2D4327CC297151BB!330.entry">from Herb Sutter on this post</a>.<br /><br />Lots of good stuff has been voted in like nullptr, explicit conversion operators, atomic types, and a threading library.  It&#8217;s certainly a slow process but the improvements should all be pretty good, although not everyone is a fan of C++, but hey, I like it.</div>

wxWidgets 3.0 will be released in 2008.  You can read some details <a href="http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/2007/11/looking-forward-to-wxwidgets-3.html">here</a>.<br /><br />Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your viewpoint) this new major release will not be the radical rethink that has been mooted for the past couple of years.  The major feature will be the full integration of unicode which would be the only build type (as there was also an ANSI configuration).  This means that ANSI would get converted into unicode internally.  This new version will also require minimal changes to existing code to get it to compile.  I suppose people already working in unicode could potentially have no more upheaval than a point release.<br /><br />This means all the plans which suggested the radical rethink for v3 have been moved under <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/wiki/index.php/Development:_wxTNG">wxTNG on the wiki</a>.  Certainly noone ever agreed on direction for this and this does mean there will be no compatibility issues.  Hopefully this means a gradual move to newer ideas rather than the complete redesign, which would be more likely to reap some results (eg, like improving the messaging framework would be one such thing).  Another avenue I reckon which would make more sense is to use current wx as a backend for a more experimental API.<br /><br />Anyway it certainly is an extremely comprehensive framework with a liberal license unlike some other options, also the Python bindings in <a href="http://wxpython.org/">wxPython</a> are really very good.</div>

Microsoft have announced Visual Studio 2008 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/nov07/11-05TechEdDevelopersPR.mspx">will be released at the end of November 2007</a>.  It was announced as part of <a href="http://www.mseventseurope.com/teched/07/developers/content/Pages/Default.aspx">Microsoft TechEd Europe</a> in Spain.<br /><br />A lot of the details about MFC and native development are still shrouded in mystery.  Some of this I have outlined <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/10/gui-toolkits-mfc-v9-visual-studio-2008.html">in a previous post</a>.

When you are writing a shared library (DLL) you have to put a lot of thought into the public interface which your customer (another programmer) will be using.<br /><br />What you have to work out is whether it is closed or open source, whether the binaries are supplied, and how you keep the user from having broken interfaces on different versions.  All of this is from the point of view from a C++ programmer.<br /><br />I think it is best to start with how not to write a closed-source library:<br />* Do not use templates.<br />* Do not have implementation half in the binary and half in the headers.<br />* Do not expose the innards of your program.<br /><br />When creating a closed-source library you have to firewall the innards (which are probably commercially sensitive) from the interface.  This would mean some use of the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PimplIdiom">Pimpl Idiom</a>.<br /><br />You need to use solidly defined types like if you were binding to another language like Python.  This means that the implementation can live in the binary and the interface is defined in your headers.<br /><br />One of the problems it is easy to encounter is when STL is exposed in the library.  The problem occurs when people use different implementations of the standard library which means you either need to maintain versions for that particular setup.<br /><br />By making those two decisions you can massively simplify the maintenance and the headaches of people trying to implement it.  You have to think carefully about the simplest interface for the developers who have to work out how to integrate it.<br /><br />By not exposing the innards of the library you can also protect yourself from problems when the library loads/unloads because you can&#8217;t have conflicting CRTs/libraries.<br /><br />I suppose what I am suggesting is to have the most simple public interface and make sure that all implementation is hidden away.  Almost only using a C interface for a library means you don&#8217;t encounter the problems where you have to think about supplying a version for each version of the compiler your users have.</div>

The latest SPA Cambridge talk is coming on the 14th November, follow the <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/WindowsPresentationFoundation">link here to sign up</a>.  Here are the details:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Windows Presentation Foundation</span><br /><br />Ian Griffiths Interact Software Limited<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Synopsis</span><br /><br />Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a platform for building Windows desktop applications that can take full advantage of the graphical capabilities of modern PCs. Whereas many UI frameworks in the past have merely added yet another layer of abstraction on what was there before, WPF is radically different from its predecessors. This talk will discuss what possessed Microsoft to abandon the strategy of incremental tinkering that has served them well for over 20 years of Windows application development. WPF shifts away from many of the fundamental mechanisms that had been in place since the first version of Windows, and we will explore the new possibilities this creates.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Speaker Biography</span><br /><br />Ian Griffiths is an independent WPF consultant, developer, speaker and Pluralsight instructor and a widely recognized expert on the subject. He lives in London but can often be found on various developer mailing lists and newsgroups, where a popular sport is to see who can get him to write the longest email in reply to the shortest possible question. Ian maintains a <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">popular blog</a> and is co-author of &#8220;Windows Forms in a Nutshell&#8221; and of &#8220;Mastering Visual Studio .NET&#8221;.</div>
