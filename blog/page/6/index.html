<div class="post-content"><p>I discovered a way to consistently crash xorg using the nvidia driver.  Open webkitgtk, close it, wait fiver seconds, open it again, rinse and repeat for 15 minutes.  Boom xorg explodes.  Go look at the logs and you have a stack trace telling you something went wrong. As far as I can tell it is running out of texture memory. Bizarrely it doesn&#8217;t do this for videos.</p>

<p>The nvidia driver itself is really quite good in the grand scheme of things providing things like tear-less, hardware accelerated video. It&#8217;s still more consistent and better quality than the open-source ones (obviously owning all the IP and information helps).</p>

<p>But this is the problem with binary blobs you can&#8217;t tell what is going on inside until the state is spat out in the event of failure. I generated the bug report using the nvidia supplied tool and looked at it myself, and there was no information in there that would give a clue as to why. If the internals were exposed you could look at where the memory was going like in the days of <a href="http://blog.programmerslog.com/?p=367">GEM memory leaks on Intel</a>.</p>

<p>I guess open-source has its own set of advantages and limitations, as well as the closed-source approach, but damn, I hate losing many hours trying to at first reproduce then diagnose it, let alone being able to make an attempt to fix it.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Yesterday at the University of Hertfordshire was the first <a href="http://www.unicomics.co.uk/UniComics/Unicon.html">Unicon</a> &#8211; the <a href="http://www.unicomics.co.uk/UniComics/UniComics_Home.html">Unicomics</a> Comic Convention organised by <a href="http://www.dannygraydon.com/2010/03/coming-soon-unicomics/">Danny Graydon</a>. It is the closest comic event to Cambridge I can think of, and it was jam packed with the cream of small-press creators.</p>

<p>So I spent the day strolling around spending money on small press comics and going to panels. Unfortunately the panels I went to were very sparsely attended, but that meant they were more entertaining and interactive.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d do a list of the creator&#8217;s work I picked up since they all produce such fantastic work (and they all have tasters online):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://massacreforboys.blogspot.com/">Steve and Chris Denton&#8217;s Massacre and Walking Wounded</a> &#8211; The original zombie nazis comic.  Great art and entertainment.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.strip-for-me.com/">Doug Noble&#8217;s Complex</a> &#8211; which is about scientists trapped in a scientific complex at the end of the world.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.modernmonstrosity.moonfruit.com/#/shop/4537202010">Oliver Lambden&#8217;s Bloc</a> &#8211; a silent story filtered through the best of bande desinee.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.necessarymonsters.com/">Daniel Goodbrey and Sean Azzopardi&#8217;s Necessary Monsters</a> &#8211; Monsters and secret agencies.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pbrainey.com/tntltp.htm">Paul Rainey&#8217;s There&#8217;s No Time Like The Present</a></li>
<li><a href="http://angrycandy.co.uk/">Andrew Cheverton and Tim Keable&#8217;s West: Justice</a> &#8211; A beautiful hardcover western book</li>
<li><a href="http://www.webcomicsnation.com/joedecie/">Joe Decie&#8217;s What I Drew</a> &#8211; Truth and lies in comics form</li>
<li><a href="http://notregret.com/jambo/">George Beedham&#8217;s Jambo</a> &#8211; The UK&#8217;s premiere jam based superhero.</li>
<li><a href="http://wearewordsandpictures.com/">Paper Science</a> &#8211; It&#8217;s newspaper shaped but full of comics.</li>
</ul>


<p>Fingers crossed there is another one of these events next year, it was very well organised and deserves a bigger turnout.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>This may turn out to be one of those hollow promises again, but I am going to get this blog up and running again even if it kills me. The baby is sleeping (and snoring) upstairs so I have time, unless I am forced to do cleaning.</p>

<p>So what is new? <a href="http://www.camvine.com">Camvine</a> did fill those vacancies with some good guys. I was surprised to hear some people even heard about it form this humble page.</p>

<p>What I need to do now though is try and get some Python changes merged upstream. I have been beating the networking code in urllib2 and httplib (two completely separate yet hopelessly intertwined) modules actually working. This means fixing HTTPS, digest proxy authentication, in fact proxy authentication, and tons more subtle interactions (like passing on CONNECT requests).</p>

<p>Strangely prescient was the article <a href="http://jessenoller.com/2010/04/22/why-arent-you-contributing-to-python/">Why Aren&#8217;t You Contributing To Python</a> since I have worked out all these fixes. I think the order will need to be 1) write lots of tests 2) get a number of small patches 3) cross reference it all with the python bug tracker. And this is all only in 2.6.4 currently.</p>

<p>And this year I will be going to <a href="http://www.europython.eu/">Europython</a> and aiming to not get serious food poisoning again&#8230;</p>

<time datetime="2009-12-03T00:00:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 3<span>rd</span>, 2009</time>
</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>We are supposed to be concerned with our power consumption. After all <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-big-screen-tvs19-2009nov19,0,4027697.story">California has enshrined in law</a> restrictions on the power usage of televisions.</p>

<p>Working for a <a href="http://www.camvine.com">digital signage company</a> I have to deal with a lot of displays. The initial hardware platform only had VGA output, great, power saving worked using DPMS. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_Display_Power_Management_Signaling">VESA Display Power Management Signaling</a> standard version 1.0 was released in 1993, even since moving from CRTs to the flat screen world we live in nowadays (making some of hsync and vsync options surplus to requirements on new flat screens, but it simply maps to &#8220;off&#8221;). The monitors people used behaved themselves. The next platform we used briefly had DVI and VGA output and monitors that supported those inputs all adhered to the teenage standard.</p>

<p>But this is where problems now creep in. DVI can be plugged into an HDMI port very easily. The current hardware platform has native HDMI so it is fairly obvious to suggest that customers use this rather than the VGA output that is also available.</p>

<p>This is where I stepped through the looking glass. Apparently because HDMI and DVI are electrically equivalent then there is nothing to stop the manufacturer having DPMS support. I was developing thinking that HDMI would be great for users since they would also get audio transport built into the single cable. I kind of assumed DPMS was still working.</p>

<p>I have yet to find a single display that does respect DPMS. Of course most people want to use cheap consumer televisions so they don&#8217;t stand a chance of this support.</p>

<p>The most worrying thing I have found about those cheap consumer displays is that they do supply VGA ports that don&#8217;t even support DPMS. A lot of these displays also have a &#8220;feature&#8221; to power off after a ten minute (or so) period of inactivity and the only way to power it on is to physically press the power button or the remote, it doesn&#8217;t even notice when a signal starts again(!)</p>

<p>There are two possible solutions. One is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#CEC">HDMI-CEC</a>, which is Consumer Electronic Control. One or two of the pins (depending on the HDMI version) is essentially a serial port, and this provides the standard for communication on this. This would be good but you need extra chips built into your HDMI output which only one computer has (a Toshiba laptop &#8211; and it only works on Windows&#8230;). Also the even larger problem is that every manufacturer seems to have their own standard, RegzaLink, SIMPLink, VIERAlink, BRAVIAsync, and a myriad of others. If you buy all your equipment from the same manufacturer you will end up with some benefit.</p>

<p>The other solution at least in the digital signage use is to use the RS232 service port for controlling the display. Each monitor tends to have its own way of doing it and can even vary between model numbers. Also it has been heard from the manufacturers that they will be phasing this out and most new TVs don&#8217;t even have it.</p>

<p>In summary? Display power saving used to work for most people, now it doesn&#8217;t. So, it is all well and good reducing the power consumption of the devices but there is a way of removing a lot of power from the equation by switching off the panel when it isn&#8217;t being used. This was a solved problem that has been unsolved by engineering madness. Because some TVs are unable to wake from their power saving state over any connection I ended up having to add a &#8220;power saving&#8221; option that doesn&#8217;t actually save any power&#8230;.</p>

<p>Interesting stuff from the main introduction. There are over 440 delegates. There are some raffles including the coins designed by Stani using free software. Also they&#8217;re looking for venues for 2011/2012 but it sounds like a hell of a lot of work.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.europython.eu/talks/timetable/">loads of talks</a> so my brain should be crammed after three days of that. I might also try out doing a lightning talk whilst I am there. although I would have to put some thought into what I&#8217;d talk about.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Some BIOS have problems booting from USB pen drives. This lead to to what I consider an insane discovery, USB flash drives have heads, cylinders, and sectors/tracks, but they are entirely virtual.</p>

<p>What your normally end up with is a prompt saying &#8220;Boot Error&#8221; and nothing else of use. This is because some BIOS are limited to 1024 cylinders so you need to change the geometry of the flash drive.</p>

<p>You can do this in Linux with the following commandline (where sdX is the device which is the usb flash storage):</p>

<pre lang="Bash" colla="+">mkdiskimage -4 /dev/sdX 0 63 62
</pre>


<p>The numbers depend on the size of the USB key as they need to be chosen to get a total number of cylinders less than 1024.</p>

<p>A 1GB stick would be:</p>

<pre lang="Bash" colla="+">mkdiskimage -4 /dev/sdX 0 64 32
</pre>


<p>A 1GB-2GB stick would be:</p>

<pre lang="Bash" colla="+">mkdiskimage -4 /dev/sdX 0 128 32
</pre>


<p>A 2GB-8GB stick would be:</p>

<pre lang="Bash" colla="+">mkdiskimage -4 /dev/sdX 0 255 63
</pre>


<p>Once your geometry is set up you can go ahead and partition your device and use it.</p>

<time datetime="2009-06-21T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 21<span>st</span>, 2009</time>
</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>So installing the drivers, latest X-server, mesa and so on is only part of the puzzle to use the latest Intel graphics drivers. You also need to update your kernel for more features like better kernel memory management, kernel mode switching, and other basic things. The driver can work (for differing levels of working) for older kernels, but the bugfixes tend to be on the latest version. I have tried this on an Intel 945GM.</p>

<p>So this is how you update your kernel for Jaunty (and other Ubuntus would probably work). A really handy repository of kernels is maintained by Ubuntu called <a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/">Mainline PPA</a> where you can download pretty much any version of the kernel.</p>

<p>So for kernel 2.6.30 you need to download the following file : <a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.30/linux-image-2.6.30-020630-generic_2.6.30-020630_i386.deb">linux-image-2.6.30-020630-generic_2.6.30-020630_i386.deb</a><br/>
You need to install this by calling:<pre colla="+" lang=”Bash”> sudo dpkg -i linux-image-2.6.30-020630-generic_2.6.30-020630_i386.deb </pre></p>

<p>As part of the install it should have run update-grub. If not run <strong>sudo update-grub</strong></p>

<p>To get kernel modesetting working as well as fixing a couple of minor issues you need to edit the file <strong>/boot/grub/menu.lst</strong> for some extra parameters. You need to edit the line that looks like:</p>

<pre colla="+" lang="Bash">kernel      /vmlinuz-2.6.30-020630-generic root=/dev/sda7 ro 
</pre>


<p>And add the following between &#8220;generic&#8221; and &#8220;root&#8221;:</p>

<pre colla="+" lang="Bash">nopat enable_mtrr_cleanup i915.modeset=1
</pre>


<p>The first two sort out some hardware bugs on the Intel 945 depending on the hardware platform which can vary. Acer Aspire Ones don&#8217;t necessarily have the same mtrr bugs as MSI Winds and so on. The modeset parameter switches on kernel modesetting which you will hopefully not notice many changes with.</p>

<p>I did find kernel modesetting played a lot better running X without any monitor connected and dealt with a lot of odd mode issues.</p>
