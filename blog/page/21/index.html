<div class="post-content"><p>Over the past six months I have actually got to use some tablet PCs, and I wonder why any company pursues that market unless it is seriously high margins. For a start the power of these computers are some way off the cutting edge both by processor and graphically. Also the build quality is not good with cheap flimsy plastic made to feel even more unstable thanks to a swivelling monitor so it can be a normal laptop as well.</p>

<p>What really gets me about tablet PCs is the software. I have tried both Windows XP Tablet PC Edition and Windows Vista which has integrated the functionality into the core system (I guess for certain levels of Vista). Additional functionality is provided by the driver software in order to make it easier to use. This is my main gripe, the entire GUI system is predicated around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)">WIMP</a> and specifically the way that has been set in stone by Windows. The problem is that the pen then becomes basically a pressure sensitive mouse which makes it more difficult and more work to do basic things like resize windows or the horrific right-click if there is a button on the pen. In addition there is normally a trackpad or mouse pointer mechanism built into the computer because it has not fully embraced the tablet way of doing things.</p>

<p>The drivers that the hardware suppliers give try to get around problems like multiple selection (in this instance there is a tick box next to every item in Explorer), and try to make it a bit easier. Unfortunately, because this is not integrated with the core system it is not perfect and needs to deal with unexpected system changes, say for instance plugging in an external display.</p>

<p>The tablet PCs do thrive in environments with a very focussed use where a custom UI is constructed that provides the correct interaction mechanisms.</p>

<p>I read this article <a href="http://uk.gizmodo.com/2008/07/18/the_mouse_is_for_the_scrapheap.html">The Mouse Is For The Scrapheap</a> this morning and thought they are a bit hopeful. They are really talking about other interaction mechanisms for specific tasks, not for general computing. This is entirely down to the GUI provided in the operating system, it is not designed for any other way of interacting. Microsoft want <a href="http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2008/05/27/microsoft-demonstrates-multi-touch.aspx">multi-touch at the centre of Windows 7</a>, but unless the user interface changes substantially it will be a half-hearted solution. The demonstrations centred around demonstration applications that could use it rather than the framework for the entire GUI.</p>

<p>How would the problem be solved? You would start with the multi-touch implementation and a blank screen. Then create a window that allows for the interactions user&#8217;s expect such as resizing, moving, minimising, etc. This would have to work for the hand driven multitouch in a quick and painless fashion because current window implementations would be too fiddly, but you may find some common ground that can be used in the prototype.</p>

<p>Luckily Apple had a chance for a clean break with the iPhone/iTouch and designed the user interface in a pared down fashion that works for even my fat fingers. This was done by working on a Cocoa Touch API where it is the basis of the interactions the user has, and the main system applications provide a roadmap for the GUI design.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>My way of surfing the Internet up until last week was to go through the links in my bookmarks (hosted on <a href="http://del.icio.us/">delicious</a>) and see if there was anything I wanted to read. It&#8217;s a very long-winded approach to surfing the Internet that requires knowing what was there before and aso visting sites that have no updates.</p>

<p>On this blog I made sure I had an RSS feed, but rarely used them myself apart from tracking bug reporting system issues and wiki changes&#8230;</p>

<p>Last week I decided to set up <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> with the websites I usually frequent. From that I have discovered there are about 600 articles per day out there that I might possibly be interested in. Now I can keep track of what I have and haven&#8217;t read, but now I need to remember to bookmark the interesting articles.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s bizarre that I have been using the Internet since 1995-ish, and this is now a fundamental change to the way I use it. I suppose this is part of the content aggregation that now defines services on the Internet.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I sometimes think its old age or something but I think modern console controllers are completely useless. I played Grand Theft Auto 4 on the X-Box 360 and realised the controller was useless, you had shoulder buttons, shoulder analogue buttons, a direction pad, plenty of buttons, an analogue stick, and buttons in the centre. They are also all laid out for people whose hands and fingers are a certain size. The PS3 is just as guilty with loads of controls and not much design progression from previous generations, I really struggled with first person shooters.</p>

<p>The problem really is that these controllers are trying to solve all eventualities and not sticking to the &#8220;less is more&#8221; convention. When you are what is defined as a hardcore gamer you are used to it and can&#8217;t understand why anyone can&#8217;t pick these controllers up and use them easily. Also games try to use every button because they are there.</p>

<p>The way I see it in the future is that most games will come with their own controllers. This has a two fold effect, firstly the controller represents the way that you want the user to interact with the game and clearly defines the user experience. Secondly, the controller becomes part of the package you are buying, so you are not getting just software which is a way of rhaving an incentive to actually buy the package.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Wii gets so much of this right. The controllers are simple and intuitive and encourage &#8220;casual&#8221; play because you don&#8217;t have to re-wire your brain for a quick play. Also the controllers are multi-paradigm with more than one component, you can use it as a SNES-like controller, you can use an analogue stick, you can use the accelerometers. The other part of this is that the controllers &#8220;dock&#8221;, for instance Mario Kart has a steering wheel you put the Wii controller inside, as does Guitar Her and its ilk. This also dramatically reduces the cost of manufacturing a custom controller.</p>

<p>My favourite controller is <a href="http://www.xgaming.com/">this</a> though&#8230;</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I only started using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> last week and I have been completely in awe of its features and how much it is a step forward from Blogger.</p>

<p>Now a week later my Dashboard is informing me WordPress 2.6 is out and did I want to upgrade. The new features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Post revisions &#8211; so you can get wiki-like tracking of changes.</li>
<li>Press This! &#8211; So you can blog from anywhere on the web and do instant embedding of Flickr and YouTube content.</li>
<li>Gears &#8211; It now makes use of Google&#8217;s Gears to help speed up via caching.</li>
<li>Theme previews &#8211; You can try out themes before they are publicly seen on your site.</li>
<li>Word count &#8211; for those who want endless statistics.</li>
<li>Image captions.</li>
<li>Improvements to plug-in management.</li>
</ul>


<p>I used the <a href="http://www.zirona.com/software/wordpress-instant-upgrade/">instant upgrade plug-in</a> for WordPress, and it was painless and fast. It is really easy to upgrade now which is fantastic when you are managing your own website.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>The <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> Project (a C/C++/Objective-C front-end for the <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>) has recently released the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/StaticAnalysis.html">LLVM/Clang Static Analyzer</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit of a fan of static analysis, having posted quite a few times on my previous blog about Lint. Lint is much more comprehensive than the new one out of the Clang project but then again this is much younger and free.</p>

<p>At the moment the tool analyses C and Objective-C with rules to find problems with memory allocation patterns. It looks like the tool will be actively maintained as it will also be used inside of Apple. The HTML reports it generates are easy to use and read which is always a bonus.</p>

<p>There are a few posts about this analyser out there on the Internet. There are blog posts about using it <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/blog/2008/07/07/new-tool-on-the-block-the-llvmclang-static-analyzer/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2008/07/14/the-clang-static-analyzer/">here</a>. There is also the original <a href="http://www.reddit.com/info/6qhdj/comments/">Reddit discussion of the announcement</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly the <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium X</a> (instant messaging client) have started to use the tool and have discovered a few problems. The results of the analysis are <a href="http://trac.adiumx.com/wiki/StaticAnalysis">here</a> (although there is some kind of server error at the moment so you can see it in the Google Cache <a href="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:5K2wbL2DVJEJ:trac.adiumx.com/wiki/StaticAnalysis+clang+static+analysis&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=12&amp;gl=uk&amp;client=firefox-a">here</a>).</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I wanted to use WordPress for my blog, hence abandoning Blogspot, but I needed to find a hosting service that would allow me to do so.</p>

<p>I did lots of searching and decided to steer well clear of the cheap&#8217;n&#8217;cheerful hosts because I could read too many horror stories about them. Also, I wanted a UK host so support is on the same time zone as my existence as I am one of the strange computer types who doesn&#8217;t work on nocturnal hours.</p>

<p>After much searching I found a smaller company called <a href="http://www.clook.co.uk/">Clook</a> which had some good reviews mainly about the service. I bit the bullet and got the shared server package which was reasonably priced (£50 + VAT for the year).</p>

<p>What has really impressed me about them is how good their service is. When you have a problem they are quick and responsive and have a real grasp of how to actually fix things. They even helped me sort out the dead-brained error I had made installing WordPress.</p>

<p>The hosting provides all the features you could want when setting up a website with <a href="http://www.cpanel.net/index.html">cPanel</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastico_(web_hosting)">Fantastico</a>. You have the usual suspects running on Linux, Python, PHP, Perl, MySQL, and you can probably request some custom work if necessary. You also get backups and cron jobs.</p>

<p>So to sum up <a href="http://www.clook.co.uk/">Clook</a>, they have reasonable prices, excellent service, and provide some compelling features.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a> is my browser of choice on the Mac mainly because I can&#8217;t live without my Add-Ons.</p>

<p>To make Firefox more Mac-like I recommend the two following Add-Ons:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.takebacktheweb.org/">GrApple Deicious (Blue)</a> &#8211; Is a theme for Firefox that makes it look very close to Safari. Simply it looks like a Mac application so you never feel you are using an alien environment.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1951">Fission</a> &#8211; This changes the progress bar for loading pages. It changes the look so that the progress is shown in the address bar, which means you can switch off the status bar for an even more Mac-like experience.</li>
</ul>


<p>Just those two Add-Ons give Firefox 3 a real boost on the Mac (how shallow &#8211; it&#8217;s the surface experience). In Firefox 3 there have been more changes under the bonnet for better Mac integration with native-look widgets and improved rendering.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just on Mac the situation is improved, I have been using it on Windows Vista and to sum it up, Firefox 3 is blazingly fast and looks really quite good. The best feature is the improved speed of Javascript which really makes scripting-heavy websites a pleasure to use and you don&#8217;t seem to get the multiple tabs hanging when something complex is trying to happen.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>A difficulty with any company is keeping up that spirit of innovation when it is established. Different companies approach is in different ways or even not at all, so it is always interesting to hear how they approach it.</p>

<p>One of my favourite articles of recent times (which inspired the title of this post) is <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/04/17/pixars-brad-bird-on-fostering-innovation/">Pixar&#8217;s Brad Bird on Fostering Innovation</a>.</p>

<p>There is a great quote from Steve Jobs in the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jobs told him: “The only thing we’re afraid of is complacency—feeling like we have it all figured out,” Bird quotes his boss as saying “…We want you to come shake things up.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Brad Bird provides nine lessons, which although are for a creative animation company, are generally applicable. My favourite one is the first lesson, &#8220;Herd your black sheep&#8221;, which involves finding the artists with ideas for making things better, and allowing them to express their ideas.</p>

<p>I think in the world of computer development the lesson &#8220;Perfect is the Enemy of Innovation&#8221; is important, because the quest for perfect perfection takes your eyes off the ball of actually delivering something. Other ideas from the article is to discuss publicly within a team to interconnect everyone&#8217;s strengths, and high morale makes creativity (and by that token productivity) cheap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to protect your success&#8221; is not immediately obvious, but I guess simply trading one-upmanship with a competitor doesn&#8217;t give you any innovation. &#8220;Interaction = Innovation&#8221;, is another about communication by encouraging not just team communication but interdisciplinary communication, people should not be cordoned off in their own little world.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/static.py?page=about.html&amp;about=eng">Google 20% time</a> is the obvious example of attempting to foster innovation. Projects such as GMail, Google News, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/">MacFUSE</a> grew out of it. It is certainly one of the most talked about aspects of having a job at Google. Recently there have been rumours from places like Valleywag saying that 20% time is being cracked down on with areas like &#8220;Google Mail Labs&#8221; being started to give developers a sandbox for which to experiment with rather than having carte blanche. I think certainly more experienced developers probably find it easier to get more out-of-the-box ideas okayed though, but then again that doesn&#8217;t make such linkable headlines.</p>

<p>Another approach to this was used by Disney&#8217;s Black Rock Studios. They hosted a Minigame Week which was outlined in a two part interview with <a href="http://www.developmag.com">Develop Magazine</a> with <a href="http://www.developmag.com/interviews/133/Mickey-and-Minigames-Part-1">part one here</a> and <a href="http://www.developmag.com/interviews/132/Mickey-and-Minigames-Part-2">part two here</a>.</p>

<p>The idea within the studio was to spend some time being creative and make a minigame in a week as a team building exercise. This involved the entire company of about 120 people. An interesting part was that it allowed people who don&#8217;t traditionally work together to do so, and they also found leaders that they did not know about before.</p>

<p>The second part of the interview contains a developer&#8217;s diary of the week&#8217;s work. Rather scarily it ends in the crescendo on Friday afternoon presentations which must be nerve-racking to get the demo to work in a week&#8230; It sounds like it was hard work but sometimes these things don&#8217;t tire you out and invigorate you.</p>

<p>Going to conferences/conventions are those kind of invigorating events and I wish I could bottle that feeling. You talk to lots of people get loads of ideas then the feeling gradually dissipates over the following weeks.</p>

<p>I think all of this is more about the people rather than the end product. It has to be kept going even through the difficult times because it is part of the company culture and the moment it stops the goodwill dissipates quickly. These companies have found ways to do it right and I think any application of the the same ideals needs to be tailored for what the company is trying to achieve, hence the minigame for games companies.</p>
