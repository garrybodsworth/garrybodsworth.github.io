<div class="post-content"><p>I did start to write a post about my enthusiasm for technology, and more specifically how using Macs and the iPhone has been generally a pleasure. Then I suffered from the <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/07/11/apple_releases_iphone_and_ipod_touch_software_2_0_see_warning.html">iBrick upgrade</a> for my iPhone and got all depressed&#8230;</p>

<p>After persevering for several attempts, the upgrade took, and then all of the frustrations melted away. This upgrade adds massive value to the iPhone hardware I got last October. It&#8217;s not often you can say this about a phone.</p>

<p>One of the features I discovered this weekend whilst taking photos at the <a href="http://www.chelmsfordbeerfestival.org.uk/">Chelmsford Beer Festival</a> was geotagging. Now I know where I took photos which was particularly useful for documenting how someone had crashed their Subaru on a straight bit of road and wedged itself between a fence and a bollard.</p>

<p>But the reason I was so looking forward to the upgrade was getting my hands on some of the applications now available.</p>

<p>First up I got Super Monkey Ball which I suck at. It&#8217;s got amazing graphics and the right controller experience using the accelerometers, but I am useless at it. It&#8217;s definitely the big name game of the initial line-up.</p>

<p>Secondly I got a puzzler called Trism which is a nice and sedate game. I find it a pick up and play type game, so I can have a quick blast when I have a few spare minutes. Also, it is possible to pretend playing puzzle games improves your brain.</p>

<p>Finally, Super Monkey Ball may be the big name, but the best game out for the iPhone is Bejeweled. The controls work perfectly on the touch screen whether you are a double-tap or dragging player. Given the size of the images you&#8217;d expect to make lots of mistakes, but it is perfect, I have not hit a single wrong gem. The music is good and the graphics look as good as running on a desktop machine.</p>

<p>What I have noticed is now I have played some games the battery will get chomped through a lot faster than when I was only listening to music or leaving it in my pocket.</p>

Hi everyone. <br/><br/>This blog has now moved to <a href="http://blog.programmerslog.com/">Programmer&#8217;s Log</a> at its own domain using Wordpress.  The content of this blog will remain, but all new posts will be made at the <a href="http://blog.programmerslog.com/">Programmer&#8217;s Log</a>.  I&#8217;ve already posted a minor update to the TortoiseSVN Visual Studio integration. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading all this time on Blogger.  I have made just over 300 posts and I&#8217;m not planning on stopping there, so I hope you can join me. <br/><br/>Oh yes, and don&#8217;t forget to check out my new employer&#8217;s website <a href="http://www.camvine.com/">Cambridge Visual Networks (Camvine)</a>. <br/><br/>Thanks again,<br/>Garry Bodsworth</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>Recently <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> has been opening up more and more of its code, obviously hosting it on <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</a>. I thought I&#8217;d highlight a few of them.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/">Google C++ Testing Framework</a><br/>
<em>Google&#8217;s framework for writing C++ tests on a variety of platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Windows CE, and Symbian). Based on the xUnit architecture. Supports automatic test discovery, a rich set of assertions, user-defined assertions, death tests, fatal and non-fatal failures, various options for running the tests, and XML test report generation.</em></p>

<p>There are a number of C++ unit testing frameworks out there. A good article navigating the minefield can be read <a href="http://www.gamesfromwithin.com/articles/0412/000061.html">here</a>. Advantages of the this framework is mainly it is backed by Google, it is mature, supplies a lot of functionality, and that it is portable.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/">Protocol Buffers</a><br/>
<em>Protocol buffers are Google&#8217;s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages – Java, C++, or Python.</em></p>

<p>There are obviously loads of ways to serialise data, but it seems to support a number of languages and is space efficient (at least in comparison to XML). I&#8217;m not too sure how much it would offer over JSON although this does mean you don&#8217;t have to write or find some of the code yourself in the various languages.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ratproxy/">Ratproxy</a><br/>
*A semi-automated, largely passive web application security audit tool, optimized for an accurate and sensitive detection, and automatic annotation, of potential problems and security-relevant design patterns based on the observation of existing, user-initiated traffic in complex web 2.0 environments. Detects and prioritizes broad classes of security problems, such as dynamic cross-site trust model considerations, script inclusion issues, content serving problems, insufficient XSRF and XSS defenses, and much more. *</p>

<p>I mainly included this because I like the name&#8230; But it is also a useful tool for discovering weaknesses in your website&#8217;s security. I&#8217;ve read about commercial apps that do this but not too many open-source ones, so this release from Google can only be a good thing.</p>

<p><strong>Some other quick ones:</strong><br/>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dom-checker/">Browser DOM Checker</a><br/>
*A simple utility to thoroughly validate DOM, XMLHttpRequest, and cookie security restriction handling in modern web browsers. Notable features include exhaustive hierarchy crawling, cross-domain IPC system for blind write verification, page transition checks, and more. *</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/bunny-the-fuzzer/">Bunny the Fuzzer</a><br/>
*A closed loop, high-performance, general purpose protocol-blind fuzzer for C programs. Uses compiler-level integration to seamlessly inject precise and reliable instrumentation hooks into the traced program. These hooks enable the fuzzer to receive real-time feedback on changes to the function call path, call parameters, and return values in response to variations in input data. This architecture makes it possible to significantly improve the coverage of the testing process without a noticeable performance impact usually associated with other attempts to peek into run-time internals. *</p>

      <a href="/blog/2008/07/09/tortoisesvn-visual-studio-integration/">TortoiseSVN Visual Studio Integration</a>
    </h1>
  
  








  


<time datetime="2008-07-09T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 9<span>th</span>, 2008</time>
</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>I developed this Visual Studio integration whilst migrating a previous company (NC Graphics) from Visual SourceSafe to the brave new world of <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>.  Developing is a bit of a strong word since it is only a settings file for Visual Studio, but it does the job admirably in a non-intrusive way and has no performance effects at all on the IDE.</p>

<p>The settings file gives you a new toolbar, a new menu, and new items on the context menus in the solution view.  You get some nice <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a> standard icons to make it even easier.</p>

<p>This all works with Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 (and even the Express Editions), along with a standard installation of TortoiseSVN.  Unless you want to edit the commandline in the External Tools I recommend installing TortoiseSVN to the default location.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s quick to set up, just go to your &#8220;Tools&#8221; menu and choose &#8220;Import and Export Settings&#8221; and follow the instructions. Ensure the tick box for which settings to import are all ticked.  If the settings don&#8217;t work first time, try again, as Visual Studio can be a bit flaky when loading.  It will replace your External Tools because they have to be stored in the correct numbered slot due to the way they are implemented in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Unfortunately renaming is well beyond the external tools implementation I have used.  TortoiseSVN 1.5 does have some additional functionality to rebuild the links for renamed files which is really useful.</p>

    <strong>Files In The Distribution</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>SubversionMenu.vssettings</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.  This adds a menu to the IDE for TortoiseSVN with the appropriate icons.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>SubversionMenuToolbar.vssettings</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.  This adds a menu for TortoiseSVN as well as a toolbar using the appropriate icons.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>SubversionMenuToolbarContexts.vssettings</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is a settings file for Visual Studio 2008.  This adds not only the menu and toolbar, but also adds the items to the appropriate context menus for files and solutions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>SubversionMenuToolbarContextsVS2005.vssettings</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This provides the menu, toolbar and context menus for TortoiseSVN in Visual Studio 2005.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>SubversionInstall.vbs</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Use this file if you want the external tools only.  These will be appended to the list, otherwise use the settings files.  Don&#8217;t use in addition to the settings file.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This simply installs a set of External Tools into Visual Studio for common TortoiseSVN operations. It can be installed on versions above Visual Studio.NET (version 7.0). Currently it is configured for Visual Studio 2008 (version 9.0), to make it work on other versions change the variable &#8220;strVisualStudioVersionNumber&#8221; as outlined in the file&#8217;s comments.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also, if you have installed TortoiseSVN in a non-default location, make sure that you change the variable &#8220;strTortoiseSVNBin&#8221; to the correct binary path. Make sure that the backslashes are doubled up.

<div class="post-content"><p>Welcome to the Programmer&#8217;s Log (although I do wonder if it should be called Programmer Slog).</p>

<p>This is really a continuation of my previous blog <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com">Garry&#8217;s Bit Patterns</a>, but using WordPress, and on my own domain. I did consider importing all of the articles but it is best to start anew. The best content (like the TortoiseSVN Visual Studio integration) will make its way here.</p>

<p>Hopefully I will also be joined by some other programmers who slave at the coal face of day-to-day development, to share some of their pearls of wisdom.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to doing some WordPress hacking (expect a few posts about that) and some more artistic designing endeavours. Also expect me to try some web hackery now I have a server to play with &#8211; and I need to get my money&#8217;s worth.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,<br/>
Garry</p>

Here in the UK we had an episode of The Money Programme broadcast on the BBC called <a href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/b00c6sdc.shtml">Bill Gates: How a Geek Changed the World</a>.  Follow the link to see it on the iPlayer.<br /><br />An interesting part of this is <span style="font-style:italic;">Steve Wozniak: How it began</span> which is highlighted and can be watched on the BBC News site <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7464704.stm">here</a>.  It&#8217;s certainly nice to think of a time when the computer business wasn&#8217;t all about taking over the world.  It&#8217;s a brief video from how he got involved in computers, through starting Apple.<br /><br />It&#8217;s nice to see some programmes on TV that look at computing, in fact I&#8217;m amazed at the lack of ones about the history of computing.  Although we may be getting a dramatisation featuring <a href="http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/06/leo-dicaprio-at.html">Leonardo DiCaprio as a co-founder of Atari</a>&#8230;</div>

The <a href="http://programmersatwork.wordpress.com/">Programmers At Work</a> blog have posted a 1986 interview with Bill Gates - you can <a href="http://programmersatwork.wordpress.com/bill-gates-1986/">read it here</a>.<br /><br />What is incredibly bizarre is that he talks a lot of sense and a lot of it is still applicable today.  Certainly 20 years later substitute assembler for C, and C with a scripting language in the article and you can believe it was a recent article.<br /><br />It&#8217;s hard to believe Microsoft is the same company that Bill Gates is talking about in this interview as he has such a pragmatic outlook towards development.  With those attitudes you can see why Microsoft became successful, but it also shows you can&#8217;t stay that way forever without great effort.  Most of my teenage years and adult life I have seen Microsoft as this big monopoly and it was nice to see something that shows what it was like before then.</div>

I&#8217;ve blogged a few times in the past about <a href="http://torjo.com">John Torjo</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://torjo.com/win32gui/index.html">Win32 GUI Generics</a>.  It was really quite an impressive accomplishment using the advanced C++ techniques in Windows development, but was a bit of a rough diamond. I did do some minor changes to my local copy when I was playing around with it to make sure that the widgets used the correct Windows theming engine, and it was surprisingly easy to add which is a testament to the quality of the code.  It did take ages to compile though with all those templates.<br /><br />I notice that now John Torjo has posted <a href="http://torjo.blogspot.com/2008/06/egui-easy-gui-for-c.html">eGUI++ to his blog</a>.  Hopefully this is a progression using all he learnt with his previous iteration in Win32 GUI Generics.<br /><br />There is an article about eGUI++ on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc534994.aspx">MSDN here</a> written by John.  It covers the basics of what he has done and covers some of the features.  It is typesafe at compile time which is great for catching errors early as most GUI toolkits you rarely find those types of problems until runtime (especially when using Windows resources).<br /><br />You can download it from <a href="http://torjo.com/egui/">here</a>.  The example presented on that page is quick and to the point.  Hopefully this is a toolkit to watch.</div>

Tomorrow there is the latest <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">BCS SPA</a> talk in Cambridge.  This month we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency Injection</a> by Stephen Oakman.  If you&#8217;re in Cambridge and fancy a computer talk with the obligatory pub-based discussion afterwards, give it a go.<br /><br />Coming up in July <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> is giving a talk in Cambridge called &#8220;Life in the Information Economy&#8221; as part of the Cambridge Business Lecture series.  You can sign up <a href="http://www.cambridgebusinesslectures.com/cory-doctorow-on-life-in-the-information-economy/">here</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote>We made a bet, some decades ago, that the information economy would be based on buying and selling (and hence restricting copying of) information. We were totally, 100 percent wrong, and now the world’s in turmoil because of it. What does a copy-native economy look like? How do everyone from barbers to musicians become richer, more fulfilled and more civilly engaged in a real information society. And what do we do about the fact that a couple of dinosauric entertainment companies are determined to screw it up?</blockquote><br /><br />He&#8217;s a science fiction author, blogger and journalist.  If you follow <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">BoingBoing.net</a> you&#8217;ll have read a lot of his stuff.  He makes his books available under the Creative Commons licence and I would consider him one of the foremost thinkers (and doers) in the modern minefield of information and ownership (he was European Affairs Coordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation).<br /><br />Comics adaptations of his fiction have been made available under the Creative Commons licence.
