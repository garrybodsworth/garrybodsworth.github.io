<blockquote>F3 is actually a declarative Java scripting language with static typing for good IDE support and compile-time error reporting (unlike JavaScript&#8230;), type-inference, declarative syntax, and automatic data-binding with full support for 2d graphics and standard Swing components as well as declarative animation. You can also import java classes, create new Java objects, call their methods, and implement Java interfaces.</blockquote>The blog of the lead developer is available <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/chrisoliver/category/F3">here</a>.  This looks like another interesting Java project, which is developed by Sun, so it will be open-sourced very soon.<br /><br />There are lots of demos available on the blog, so you can see the work first-hand.  It kind of reminds me of <a href="http://www.torjo.com/win32gui/">Win32GUI Generics</a>.  It looks pretty interesting and something new for Java, so it would be something to keep an eye on.</div>

It&#8217;s only a couple of days since the news that Java is going GPL.  The kind of initial flurry has died down but the substance is starting to come along.<br /><br />The <a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/">OpenJDK</a> project is off and running.  There are two parts - the <a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/compiler/">Java Compiler</a> and the <a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/hotspot/">Java Hotspot VM</a>.<br /><br />The <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish Project</a> is for the goal of building open-source, production quality, enterprise software.  This project is already a year old.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve downloaded some of the code already to take a look at it.  It&#8217;s quite nicely written and as such is pretty understandable for such a complex project.</div>

You can&#8217;t have escaped this platform, you might not have heard about it, but it provides the basis for <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>, <a href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Democracy Player</a>, and <a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/">SongBird</a> (which I mentioned <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/digital-music-songbird.html">before</a> and it&#8217;s continuing apace).  A good place to start is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XULRunner">Wikipedia article on XULRunner</a>, it provides the links you need to get started.<br /><br />XULRunner is not simply a user interface but probably could be described as a platform like Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Application_Markup_Language">XAML/.NET</a> or like <a href="http://www.java.net/">Java&#8217;s virtual machine</a> (very loosely) or <a href="http://dev.aol.com/boxely/">Boxely from AOL</a>.  Essentially it provides a layer of abstraction from the underlying architecture in order to allow the developer to work on the actual coding.  XULRunner is the framework to allow standalone applications to be developed using the XUL language used for Firefox extensions.<br /><br />Currently <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner">XULRunner</a> is in beta with version 1.8, but with version 1.9 next year they recommend that for production releases.  Along with the 1.9 release the Gecko rendering engine is also getting updated with some additional nice vector rendering.<br /><br />The framework provides a myriad of features.  There is built-in spell-checking, networking, the aforementioned Gecko engine, web services, storage/SQLie interfaces, UI, the ability to embed in another application, and also the Python bindings (full version forthcoming).  I think the reason that I find this quite interesting is the two applications I have used most at home and work in the past couple of years have been based on this.  I just wonder how far it can all be pushed for heavyweight desktop application development.<br /><br />You can view a list of applications based on XULRunner <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner_Hall_of_Fame">here</a>.  When the final proper release of 1.9 is out I imagine there will be more people willing to use it as it won&#8217;t be all belt and braces, there can be solid tutorials and the suchlike.<br /><br />With so many of these types of projects around at the moment, I am wondering when the &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; will start to kick in.  Admittedly, XULRunner has a very strong chance since it is a platform for Thunderbird and Firefox.</div>

I&#8217;m sitting here wondering if there is anything out there to use vector based graphics to render some icons or toolbars.  I&#8217;ve been Googling for something like that out of curiosity - and I seem to have come up dry.<br /><br />The only one I have found that seems to do what I am expecting is the <a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/">Juce Library</a>.  In fact in most libraries creating and maintaining toolbars and icons is pretty laborious (especially in MFC), so you tend to write your own wrappers for functionality.  Myself, I have written code to automatically generate hot and disabled image lists in MFC so only one bitmap needs to be edited (I have also written this code more than once - problems of proprietary code).<br /><br />I know there is talk that Vista wants everyone to use vector icons (which is a problem for all those people who currently use bitmaps), but there seems to be very little information out there about it.<br /><br />I realise most people try to write fully featured GUI toolkits, but there must be smaller implementations of specialised functionality out there?  Kind of like common building blocks?  I suppose one would be a rendering engine using system theming, another being resource management, another rendering those resources&#8230;</div>

Here are a couple more articles to do with the open-sourcing of Java with a bit more substance.  One from <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2006/11/open-source-java">InfoQ</a> and another from <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2055770,00.asp">eWeek</a>.<br /><br />But that isn&#8217;t what this post is about.  I&#8217;ve discovered an XP look and feel style for Java called <a href="https://winlaf.dev.java.net/">WinLAF</a> as it was felt the native look was not sufficient.  Reading about Java 6.0 though suggests that a big leap forward for native Windows look and feel is being made for this version called Mustang, also taking into account Windows Vista.<br /><br />There are a myriad of enhancements for the new version of Java here including lots of alterations for Swing <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/javase6/">here</a>.  It links to all the related bug/enhancement reports.  An outline from <a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2006/09/22/jse_bling/">The Register is also available</a>.  The new rendering engine uses the Windows UxTheme DLL.<br /><br />There is an article with plenty of <a href="http://www.ffnn.nl/pages/articles/java/java-2-se-6.0-aesthetics-preview.php">screenshots of Java 6.0 aesthetics</a>.</div>

After a few weeks/months of build up the <a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS3337915997.html">the press are now reporting on Sun open-sourcing Java under the GPL license</a>.  This is free as in freedom.  This is great news, especially in the <a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_to_Pay_Novell_348_Million/1162966311">current climate brought about by Microsoft in recent weeks</a> (with the <a href="http://news.samba.org/announcements/team_to_novell/">Samba team now pubic in their opposition to the deal</a>).  Overall, this is great news and I imagine this could push Java from strength to strength.  Pair this up with the <a href="http://www.kaourantin.net/2006/11/spidermonkeys-relative-tamarin-joins.html">Adobe&#8217;s EMCAScript donation to the Mozilla Foundation</a>, I think this could be a very exciting time for the Java family of products.<br /><br />This has also got me thinking about Java user interfaces.  The last time I looked at them many years ago they were more of a Motif style of user-interface, certainly not the native look&#8217;n&#8217;feel.  I wondered how far they have got now.  I am a user of <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a> the fantastic BitTorrent client written in Java, the interface is not quite native, but has been getting closer and closer in each subsequent version.  Apparently it is also possible to build Azureus with the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">GNU Classpath library</a> supplied with the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>.<br /><br />There is some documentation about Swing look&#8217;n&#8217;feel available <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-mer05273/">here</a> about some default theming.  There is also a look&#8217;n&#8217;feel Java website <a href="http://javootoo.l2fprod.com/">here</a>.  There certainly seems to be a lot out there that runs pretty close to being native looking, but it seems to fall short in some places, I think this warrants some more investigation&#8230;</div>

hi, came across your blog while Googling. i don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re discontinuing the free antivirus <em>per se</em>, just the 7.1 version of the free antivirus. users are advised to upgrade to 7.5, that&#8217;s all.<br />as you said, i&#8217;ve had some experience with AVG and i think it&#8217;s really good. it traps quite a number of the bugs that circulate, including a number that infect via autorun, which is a rather large issue where i am at the moment.</div>

Imagine a game of Jenga except every fourth piece is booby-trapped.<br /><br />Anyone who has worked on a suitably mature commercial codebase knows exactly what I am on about.  You are severely restricted in what you can change and you are always having to look for unforeseen consequences.<br /><br />That is why it is like a game of Jenga, you remove one piece or replace it but you run the risk of it all toppling down.  I guess that is why clean slates are probably so appealing to programmers, as you reach a state of coding entropy where it is collapsing under its own weight.<br /><br />How many times have you tried to rewrite and replace something that was badly engineered and found that there were numerous side-effects.  Regression and unit testing are great things, but marketing and sales don&#8217;t care about that, and it all costs money after all.<br /><br />So next time you are banging your head up against a brick wall with what you are working on, it is just Code Jenga.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/1600/jenga.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5090/4314/320/jenga.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>

An interesting article that passed my eyes in the past couple of days was <a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/cpu/valve-multicore.ars">this one</a>.  It is about Valve&#8217;s approach to multithreaded applications, and it seems that they fought against it for as long as they could.  Since I&#8217;ve worked in industry I&#8217;ve worked entirely on mutithreaded applications and this probably is under the coarse grained model, but it looks like the fine grained model is going to get more important in the next few years and it is something we are all going to have to work out.</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/07/tortoisesvn-and-visual-studio.html">See the update here.</a></span><br /><br />Hi there everyone,<br /><br />Here is an update to the TortoiseSVN integration into Visual Studio 2005.  This update is a fairly major change since this will only have the changes to external tools, menus and toolbars.  This means when you import these settings you get a new menu at the top of the screen (with icons), a new toolbar with proper TortoiseSVN icons, and context menus for solutions and files.<br /><br />You can download the <a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/SubversionToolbarsAndMenus.zip">new settings file here</a> (it is 9k in size compressed).  All you need to do is go to your Tools menu and choose &#8220;Import and Export Settings&#8221; and follow the instructions.  Ensure the tick box for which settings to import are all ticked.<br /><br />Here are the original posts from the Subversion integration (and old files are still available).<br /><ul><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/subversion-and-tortoisesvn-programmers.html">Subversion and TortoiseSVN - A programmers best friend</a></li><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/subversion-tortoisesvn-integration.html">Subversion : TortoiseSVN Integration into Visual Studio</a> - A vbs script that will add Subversion to your external tools in Visual Studio 2003 and 2005.</li><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/subversion-tortoisesvn-integration_03.html">Subversion : TortoiseSVN Integration into Visual Studio.NET 2005 Again</a></li><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/tortoisesvn-vsnet-2005-good-stuff.html">TortoiseSVN + VS.NET 2005 = Good Stuff</a> - The original vssettings based integration with additional screenshots that still apply.</li><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/tools-for-tortoisesvn.html">Tools for TortoiseSVN</a> - Some recommended tools for TortoiseSVN.</li><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/updated-visual-studio-2005-express-and.html">Updated Visual Studio 2005 Express and TortoiseSVN Integration</a> - The first update to the vssettings implementation.</li></ul><br /><a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/SubversionToolbarsAndMenus.zip">DOWNLOAD SETTINGS FILE</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Edit: </span> Now there is a yet another update - this is now 7k.  This makes a minimum of changes to your IDE as humanly (or inhumanly) possible.

Just a quick question. The article mentions &#8220;Context Menus&#8221;. Are you talking about context menus that show up when right clicking a file or folder in the solution explorer? Because if that is the case, Eventhough I get everything else working fine, I cant see any context menus. Thanks for such a nice solution man!</div>

This is for TortoiseSVN, not TortoiseCVS.  It is probable that a similar solution can be used for that source control system.<BR/><BR/>Check out TortoiseSVN at http://tortoisesvn.net<BR/><BR/>The latest version of the Visual Studio settings is here:<BR/>http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/07/tortoisesvn-and-visual-studio.html</div>

I have done as per your setting, but i am not getting file wise Update/Commit/Get Lock/Release Lock/Revert. So i can get same way like i am doing it in VSS. It will be great if someone can solve this issue. And i am only interested in VS2005, Subverion, TortoiseSVN & vssettings. Not at all interested in any other tools. I think Garry&#8217;s Bit can solve this. Please help me.</div>

If you want to get complete Subversion integration in Visual Studio please have a look at <A HREF="http://www.visualsvn.com/" REL="nofollow">VisualSVN</A>. It wraps TortoiseSVN UI too but provides also seamless support for file operations (renames, moves etc.) and shows status in Solution Explorer. Costs just $49.</div>

Hi there,<BR/><BR/>Just to answer a couple of previous questions:<BR/><BR/>There is no internal way to resolve a conflict at the moment.<BR/><BR/>It is impossible to add icons to the front of folders since it uses the &#8220;External Tools&#8221; feature so it can work easily with the Express Editions as well as the Professional ones.<BR/><BR/>If the command being run is wrong (Dotsfuscator) it is possible the order your External Tools is incorrect or when you imported the settings they may not have all been applied.</div>

This looks promising however when I try to execute the &#8220;Update&#8221; command from the Subversion menu it seems to launch DotFuscater and not do anything else?</div>

I&#8217;ve just started using the whole SVN/Tortoise/VS2005 stuff&#8230; it seems to me that you can&#8217;t do a checkout from within VS and need to do it from Tortoise directly.  I just used Tortoise to check out to a working dir then opened up in VS and it seemed to work.<br /><br />Coming from an eclipse/CVS background what would be nice is the &#8220;decorators&#8221; in VS that tell you that you&#8217;re working with a checked out file.  That is in vs if you change a file, you get a red exclamation mark to remind you that you need to commit your changes.  I might be asking a bit much here though :)<br /><br />Regards,<br />Anthony.</div>

No problems, glad it works for you now.  Just out of interest are you using Professional or Express?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Garry</div>

Weird. When importing the settings file again, I selected the &#8220;External Tools List&#8221; checkbox and now everything shows up ok. Thanks :)</div>

They are external tools, so if the executable is not in the place it expects then it is possible that it can&#8217;t find it.  Is it also disabled on the external tools menu?<br /><br />The settings make the assumption TortoiseSVN is in the default installation location.  If this is the case then do a search and replace on the settings file for:c:&#92;program files&#92;TortoiseSVN&#92;bin&#92;tortoiseproc.exe<br />And replace it with the location that yours is installed (keeping the double slashes).<br /><br />If that is not the case then try reimporting the settings as VS2005 has this wonderful knack of getting confused when loading settings.<br /><br />Garry</div>

Hi,<br />I&#8217;ve imported the settings and everything seems to be ok, but toolbar is greyed out and the menus don&#8217;t appear. What am I doing wrong?<br /><br />Thanks for working on this :)<br /><br />Cheers, Jordan</div>
