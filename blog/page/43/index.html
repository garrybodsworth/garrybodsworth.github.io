&#8230;Or you are stuck with legacy code.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve already said that MFC isn&#8217;t as bad as most diatribes make it sound.  The macros although seen as antiquated do actually make the code pretty easy to read.<br /><br />Well, a lot of large and mature applications use MFC as the basis of their user interface, and normally due to the time and number of developers on the application the blurring between UI and the rest of the code might be a bit fuzzy.  Some products would have had a clear design from the start to abstract the UI behind a company designed layer of abstraction, but the scary thing is most of these MFC based applications probably started using the built-in app wizard.<br /><br />With Microsoft trying to force everyone into .NET framework applications they start to avoid putting functionality in MFC and only allowing it through .NET.  Fortunately it is still built on the Win32 API and means writing in standard C++ all the new features will be available so long as you roll your sleeves up and dig.<br /><br />Since Vista will probably be the dominant Windows platform for the forseeable future if you can make your MFC application look good on that platform and look well integrated then you are good to go for another five years at least.  It would certainly be worthwhile if you would never be allowed to port your app to another language or another GUI toolkit, be it from time or cost constraints or external pressures.  The benefits would be not developing your own solution and also not having the headache of maintenance, which would be critical if the size of your team does not allow for UI type fun.  It&#8217;s certainly the path of least resistance.<br /><br />With this in mind I decided to investigate MFC extension libraries.  There are four I found that are commercially supported.  Most of these offerings are simply a case of changing what classes you inherit from.  These libraries typically come with source code when you buy a licence.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.codejock.com/">CodeJock XTreme ToolkitPro</a><br />This is the best out of all the ones I have had a look at.  Simply it works the smoothest, it looks the nicest and most integrated, and it provides a rich wealth of components.  Recent versions have added the Office 2007 style ribbon-bar.  The upcoming version 10.4 fixes some outstanding issues with DWM on Vista although they certainly aren&#8217;t critical.  The demo version was certainly a breeze to get up and running.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.prof-uis.com/">Prof-UIS</a><br />This looks second best.  It certainly renders as nice as the CodeJock offering and possibly is not so skinned so it can look more integrated, but when resizing the rendering can take a while to catch up and leaves black areas (this is on Vista).  Overall the rendering speed does not seem fast enough.  Still, it is a stylish toolkit.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bcgsoft.com/">BCGControlBarPro</a><br />I think this offering is on par with Prof-UIS, it runs okay and looks good.  This one didn&#8217;t look quite right on Vista but runs fine on XP.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.theultimatetoolbox.com/">ULTIMATE toolbox</a><br />This isn&#8217;t quite as up to date with the latest features like the previous three but it seems to be well respected and seems to be the most mature.</div>

I haven&#8217;t got round to actively trying out Qt yet, although I have heard more or less universally good stuff about it (if you discount the meta-object compiler which is simply a matter of taste, oh yeah, and the price, but we all want something for nothing&#8230;).  One day I will find the time to try it out.<br /><br />Qt is the premier cross-platform GUI toolkit.  It has its foibles, but I&#8217;ll leave that for when I review it.<br /><br />One of the areas on their website details the migration to Qt from MFC.  They actually provide lots of information about how to go about this process.<br /><br />The main link is here - <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/addon/solutions/catalog/4/Windows/qtwinmigrate/">The Qt/MFC Migration Framework</a>.  The <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/solutions/4/qtwinmigrate/winmigrate-walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a> is the most practical application of the knowledge.  The <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/learnmore/migration/mfc">Q&A</a> also provides interesting tidbits.<br /><br />Honestly, there is no way to tell how successful this is without speaking to someone who has ported a moderately large and mature app from MFC to Qt, but it is interesting to see someone does provide some kind of migration path (if that is the way you want to go).</div>

During numerous hours of websurfing I stumbled across the <a href="http://oglwfw.sourceforge.net">OpenGL Window Framework</a>.  This is a thin layer on top of OpenGL to make extra nice for C++ developers.  Unfortunately it does not seem to be actively developed.<br /><br />What it provides is a nice C++ interface for OpenGL with respect for making window contexts.  It gives you access to extensions via the <a href="http://elf-stone.com/glee.php">Glee</a> library.  It gives you an enumeration framework for modes and features, and also there are design considerations for multi-threaded programming which is important in this day and age.<br /><br />It&#8217;s a very tightly focussed library designed for making using OpenGL and creating the windows for it much easier, and it seems to do that pretty well.</div>

When a new graphics card (generation) is released they normally have lots of new shiny features.  These are added to the OpenGL drivers by the extension mechanism until they are either forgotten about or become part of the standard.<br /><br />Luckily there are two projects out there to try and make it easier, the <a href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/">OpenGL Extension Wrangler (Glew)</a> and also the <a href="http://elf-stone.com/glee.php">GL Easy Extension Library (Glee)</a>.  These both provide the ability to enumerate and then use the extensions provided.  They are also cross-platform which is always a bonus.<br /><br />It is not the easiest way to maintain code as it requires specialist code depending on the graphics card&#8217;s capabilities, but if you want to be on the bleeding edge they will allow you to code there.  You will also have to be aware that the function names could change if they become part of the main OpenGL library.</div>

Since I spend a fair amount of time working with OpenGL I always take an interest in libraries that use it.  In fact a lot of game development libraries should really have applications outside of that domain, it is just that &#8220;professionals&#8221; see themselves as above using crude game development libraries.<br /><br />One of the larger projects I have found really interesting is <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/">OpenSceneGraph</a>.  It is based on the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph">scene graphs</a> which provides an object-oriented storage of the scene to aid rendering.<br /><br />This library is quite a high level of abstraction away from the underlying rendering (although it will allow you access to it).  It provides cross platform support as well as 64 bit platforms.  It probably is seen not to have the shiny whizz-bang features that are more associated with the game dedicated libraries.  Nevertheless it scales really well and can produce some <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/osgwiki/pmwiki.php/Screenshots/Screenshots">stunning results</a>.  Most of the applications are more VR related but I am sure over time it will have more diverse applications.  I always winder how something like scene graphs would work in the land of CAD, although they are not really designed for that purpose.<br /><br />Because it is OpenGL based it is really quite easy to create a view in your GUI toolkit using OpenSceneGraph, as normally they are constructed via the window handles.</div>

I got to thinking this week, surely there are some computer groups or societies in my area (hopefully filled with people I could learn from).  So off to Google I went and started to search.  I found a couple that looked interesting, although not completely limited to the Cambridge area.<ul><li><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">SPA Cambridge</a> (Software Practice Advancement) - the Cambridge branch of an offshoot of the BCS.  They have monthly talks held at Microsoft Research.  Looks interesting and I think I might check it out.  Here are links for the main <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/">BCS SPA Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.bcs.org/">BCS</a> itself.</li><li><a href="http://accu.org/">ACCU</a> looks like a really interesting group for software development with plenty of focus on C++ in the newsletter archive.</li><li><a href="http://www.camring.ucam.org/">Cambridge Computer Lab Ring</a>.  It aims to build a community in Cambridge based computing.</li><li>There is a <a href="http://www.cambridge-lug.org/">Cambridge Linux Users Group</a>.  Could be interesting for a Linux look at things.</li><li>A user interface focussed group called <a href="http://ukupa.org.uk/">Usability Professionals&#8217; Association UK Chapter</a>.  There is an area group - <a href="http://www.ukupa.org.uk/cambridge/">The Cambridge Usability Group</a>.</li><li>There is the <a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/">Code Generation Conference</a> in Cambridge this year.  Also there is an <a href="http://www.international-lisp-conference.org/2007/index">International Lisp Conference</a>.</li><li><a href="http://www.cambridge3g.com/">Cambridge Wireless</a> is a group focussed obviously on wireless stuff with plenty of events.</li><li>A more business focussed group - <a href="http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/">The Cambridge Network</a>.</li></ul>The problem with loads of the conferences is that they are normally very expensive (fine if your work is interested in sending you).  But the SPA Cambridge meetings are free, so I will definitely have to go as there is no excuse (and it looks like I missed some interesting ones in the past year).</div>

There is an interesting <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html">article here</a> about the design architecture for GUIs.  This applies more to the rich clients with database backends, but I think it is more than relevant for designing an application as it would be able to scale in the future much more easily.<br /><br />The obvious subject it covers is MVC (Model-View-Controller).  The article is kept fairly up to date as well with an update the middle of this year.</div>

This week I have been a bit light on the blogging.  The main reason for this is that I was away in Germany with work.  A little show called <a href="http://www.euromold.com/english/">EuroMold</a>, it is the biggest CAD/CAM/CAE (and more engineering type stuff) show in Europe, so all the vendors are there demonstrating and giving away free stuff.<br /><br />I saw the guys behind <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk">FreeSteel</a>, who have put together their own set of algorithms (with the main one being Adaptive Clearing) which they own and licence to anyone who wants to use them for a very reasonable price.  Julian has put <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/?p=115">his write-up of EuroMold on his blog</a>.<br /><br />What you tend to notice about the engineering software industry, is that noone seems to excel, and it is very insular.  Companies don&#8217;t talk to eachother, developers don&#8217;t talk to eachother (even though there isn&#8217;t a huge number of CAM developers in the world), there are no libraries out there that really help when it comes to developing CAM software when it comes down to the nitty gritty of machining.<br /><br />What I noticed about the software on display at EuroMold, is it all looked mostly the same. The OpenGL rendering looked excellent on some packages but the rest of the user interface was poor in comparison.  Also some tended to make the same mistakes in the user interface (as the default behaviour of code generators tends to leave some holes).  Most demonstrations were done with the standard Windows theme so it all looked like the 1990s running on Windows 95&#8230;  A bit of a pity since I have sent a couple of weeks tweaking <a href="http://www.ncgraphics.co.uk/">DEPOCAM</a> for Windows Vista, so it looks good on that platform.<br /><br />With most of the applications, they are getting more and more functionality, and doing more and more in one place.  This tends to make for cluttered applications.</div>

Joel On Software has an interesting little post <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/29.html">about source control</a> and how Microsoft does it (specifically with the Vista codebase).<br /><br />You can see how it can all get out of control, and how it is easy to find yourself stuck as part of a process that doesn&#8217;t scale, and how this can adversely effect an entire project.  It also shows a lack of modularity since other projects of a large size do not necessarily have similar problems.</div>

One deficiency we encounter with Subversion is merge tracking.  This means when we merge branches or revisions we have to keep track in a manual or scripted process which has its own overhead.<br /><br />I am pleased to see that <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> now has its own <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/merge-tracking/">merge tracking project</a>, which is in its infancy but when it drops it will make it an even better and more powerful system.
