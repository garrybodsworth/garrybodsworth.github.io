If you have an MDI application and you are going to run it under Windows Vista you could be in trouble.  I mean the MDI applications that have multiple windows and are not tabbed.  The child windows you will notice are rendered with Windows Basic even in a fully composited theme.<br /><br />Probably where I should start is the &#8220;Desktop Window Manager&#8221; or in your Task Manager dwm.exe.  This is what does the Window effects, so it is not a massive re-architecture but another application providing the extra rendering effects.  This applies the effects to the main window of your application via your graphics card.<br /><br />Now this leads into the MDI problem.  An MDI application hosts multiple windows inside one main window.  The dwm.exe provides the rendering capabilities for your main Windows, not your child windows.  This is where the problem lies, your child windows will be rendered with Aero Basic and hence look out of place in a full Aero desktop.<br /><br />Unfortunately this will make your application look a bit messy and inconsistent.  There is no solution as far as I can tell so far, although I am dedicated to finding an answer.  By far the simplest answer would be to make it a tabbed user interface, although this may not suit some applications.<br /><br />Hopefully I can find some sort of answer soon.</div>

The user interface in Windows Vista simply doesn&#8217;t feel finished.  The technology seems like it is there, but the user interface lacks consistency and the final finishing touches, an subsequently feels a bit pre-release - not the final release.<br /><br />Windows Explorer doesn&#8217;t have toolbars any more, no problem I suppose until you want to go up one folder.  This is beyond me, you have backwards and forwards (but it isn&#8217;t a web-browser), and no toolbar of common functionality.<br /><br />Most applications haven&#8217;t even been touched from their earliest incarnations, see Notepad, Task Manager, Paint, and loads of others.  These are bizarrely much easier to use, but also help to confuse you more due to the lack of overall consistency.<br /><br />In most applications the menu bar is hidden until you hit tab then it magically appears.  If Microsoft don&#8217;t like it then they should have simply excised it from all of the default Vista applications.  I imagine lots of applications with custom drawn menus look pretty weird now.<br /><br />Tabbed property sheets and toolbars look really weird when you let Windows Vista perform the rendering.  The colours aren&#8217;t quite right and this makes it look unprofessional.<br /><br />Firefox looks great in Windows Vista though - much better than it does under XP, and I was pretty happy with it there.</div>

User Access Control (UAC) is the crux of Windows Vista&#8217;s improved security.  Unfortunately it is cumbersome and intrusive, to the point that I already have it disabled.<br /><br />When something tries to alter the registry expect at least three confirmation dialogs to get this to happen.<br /><br />Directory permissions are very odd, mainly due to the restructuring of how everything is stored on the main hard drive.  In order to provide a level of backward compatibility of directories symlinks are used (<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/archives/285">which aren&#8217;t apparently as good as Microsoft were promising</a>), but unfortunately it is completely impossible to follow them as access is always denied.  This is a pain when you want to access your program data.<br /><br />Finding where the data is actually stored, you&#8217;ll end up using the search functionality.<br /><br />Also, Microsoft have you hiding system files by default, which has been the case for years, but you always end up having to switch it on to perform basic tasks.  Unfortunately with the symlinks and the sheer amount of files it is an attempt to make it unusable.  This is trying to make people use the default because the option is so hideous rather than trying to make the option so good you simply must hide the files, which I feel is the wrong way to approach just about anything.</div>

This is the most important aspect of my Windows Vista installation.  You have to confirm that you want to run the installation - par-for-the-course - but you have to run it as administrator.<br /><br />Once installed I knew there were issues with Visual Studio 2005 and Windows Vista after the numerous warning dialogs that Windows Vista pops up.  So you use this to look at the Microsoft website like it suggests, but all you get is a place-holder.  Not really a lot of good for the developer trying to confirm all is well in Vista-Land.<br /><br />Well, I loaded the C++ project up and built it.  Incremental rebuilds seem completely broken for some reason, somehow the pch (pre-compiled header) gets corrupted.  Then the next problem is you can&#8217;t compile individual C++ files.<br /><br />What I have tried doing is increasing the access by running the devenv.exe as administrator, that didn&#8217;t seem to help.<br /><br />So I thought I would try out the Visual Studio 2005 SP1 Beta since it was available for download and after all couldn&#8217;t make it that much more useless.  This was a nightmare to install, make sure that you run it as administrator by using the right-click context menu.  Be aware that this took an hour and a half to install, and I won&#8217;t know until tomorrow whether it was successful or not.  I hope this fixes the problems with the C++ elements in VS2005.</div>

I should be grateful for Vista giving so many headaches - it has given me a mountain of blog-fodder, and has also taught me some stuff I did not realise.<br /><br />I can say from experience installing software is quite a pain as you have to confirm everything.  When you start to run an installer, it locks up your session until you confirm or deny.  And it actually requires a secondary click on another confirmation dialog&#8230;<br /><br />I realise they are trying to make Windows more secure with these extra confirmations, but it can actually become counter-productive.  Once you have seen a similar looking dialog millions of times with more or less the same text you just click automatically without reading it, simply mentally blanking it out.  This is even more dangerous, you could then be confirming anything.<br /><br />Most installers work fine on Vista though, which is a relief even if you have to confirm everything.  If you have an installation created wit <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a>, it looks fantastic.<br /><br />Beware though - anything using Windows Installer runs terribly slow.  I guess it must be doing more work somehow.  Just be aware installing stuff requires lots of coffee breaks(!)<br /><br />Fingers crossed the problems can be fixed with a point release of some sort.</div>

Well, I now have Vista installed after swapping computers.  Something catastrophic happened with my own computer&#8217;s motherboard whilst installing Vista.  After a day trying to get the computer to play ball a new BIOS was installed and Vista could also work properly on that computer.<br /><br />So - a word of warning for installing Vista - <span style="font-weight:bold;">upgrade your BIOS beforehand</span>.  I have no idea why the BIOS is incompatible as the computer is only 18 months old, but at least it now works, and I hope this post stops people heading down the same blind alley.<br /><br />The boot process is definitely taking much longer than Windows XP.  Installing most software is also mostly successful.  The ubiquitous <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a> works seamlessly.</div>

So Windows Vista was released on MSDN Subscriber Downloads today.  I offered to be the Vista guinea pig and install it to make sure everything works before it hits general release.<br /><br />Two identical computers one I spent all afternoon trying to get to work which could only amount to 4-bit colour 640x480&#8230;  I tried swapping graphics cards - no luck.  The other identical twin computer, pop the disc in and bosh it is installed and looking all Aero-ey.  Even swapping the graphics cards between the two computers seems not to have helped.  This is a bizarre turn of events, especially as XP seems to have run and installed no problem.  It was not a driver problem either since it seems to have installed and understands the cards, but it seems to be an IRQ conflict of some sort, I haven&#8217;t seen one of them since the old DOS days :D<br /><br />Also, you still have to use an external source for your RAID drivers.  I was hoping that was not still the case.  Hopefully, it will all be solved by a clear head on Monday.</div>

The <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org">Enlightenment</a> project has been a cutting edge desktop environment for many years.  Although it is not seen as cutting edge any more due mainly to 3D accelerated eye candy, it is still very powerful and interesting, also it is really very efficient.<br /><br />Currently the entire product is in heavy development but it is relatively stable (see <a href="http://www.elivecd.org/">eLive to try it out with a Live CD</a>).  The system is designed around a series of libraries some of which are more complete than others.  Recently it was also revealed that <a href="http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/">Yellow Dog Linux</a> was putting together a Linux for PS3 and it was <a href="http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/news/2006/2006-10-17.shtml">using Enlightenment as the default desktop manager</a>.  This also will help provide funding for the project.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the point of this post&#8230;  A series of tutorials have just become available for the <a href="http://wiki.edevelop.org/index.php/EWL">Enlightened Widget Library (EWL)</a> portion of Enlightenment.  This provides the widget toolkit for the environment.  These are introductory tutorials and can be seen here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.edevelop.org/index.php/EWL_Introduction">Part 1</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.edevelop.org/index.php/EWL_Introduction_II">Part 2</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.edevelop.org/index.php/EWL_Introduction_III">Part 3</a><br /><br />The main development community can be accessed <a href="http://www.edevelop.org/">here</a>.  The way that Enlightenment has been put together shows obvious care and thought, after all you don&#8217;t have to necessarily have the full desktop environment to use just some of the libraries.</div>

On my Internet travels I walk randomly through following links until I find something interesting.  That is what I have done:<br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/11/10/the-office-2007-ui-bible.aspx">The Office 2007 UI Bible</a><br /><br />This is a series of many blog posts that look into the reasoning behind the new Office 2007 UI.  It covers the history of office GUIs, the new design, and how to extend that design.  There are lots of interesting points but it will take a long while to get through!</div>

<blockquote>F3 is actually a declarative Java scripting language with static typing for good IDE support and compile-time error reporting (unlike JavaScript&#8230;), type-inference, declarative syntax, and automatic data-binding with full support for 2d graphics and standard Swing components as well as declarative animation. You can also import java classes, create new Java objects, call their methods, and implement Java interfaces.</blockquote>The blog of the lead developer is available <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/chrisoliver/category/F3">here</a>.  This looks like another interesting Java project, which is developed by Sun, so it will be open-sourced very soon.<br /><br />There are lots of demos available on the blog, so you can see the work first-hand.  It kind of reminds me of <a href="http://www.torjo.com/win32gui/">Win32GUI Generics</a>.  It looks pretty interesting and something new for Java, so it would be something to keep an eye on.</div>
