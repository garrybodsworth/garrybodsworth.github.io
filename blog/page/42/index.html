Sometimes at work it just happens you are so under pressure non-stop that any hope for decent practices are out of the window and there is a constant flurry of mounting problems at your doorstep.<br /><br />Joel On Software has a little test to see just how good your work environment is for good coding.  You can see it <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">here</a>.  Go ahead work out where your company lies on the scale, 10 or lower are defined as serious problems.<br /><br />Sometimes these types of problems you can turn around with a bit of hard work.  It is not always possible though - but you have to try.  Joel also has another article about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000332.html">Getting Things Done When You Are A Grunt</a>.  This suggests it is possible to improve standards even if you are not overly experienced or not very high up.  You can also view the related discussion <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=2033">here</a>.<br /><br />It is easy for the process to overtake the coding though - and you must always keep that in check somehow when you open this Pandora&#8217;s Box - or you can spend your entire time only on that.  This isn&#8217;t good for you and not good for your colleagues.  I think if you work at a 0 rated place then it must be simple to get a few points added to the rating.</div>

On the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com">CodeProject</a> there are a couple more articles about using the Vista Native API, which is actually accessing the base API through C++, bypassing the need for .NET.<br /><br />The first article is <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/vista/VGFileDialogs.asp">Using the New Vista File Dialogs</a>.  This is actually written with <a href="http://wtl.sourceforge.net/">WTL</a> in mind, but the ideas are the same whatever you are using, so long as you can access the API.  So you can now add the new Vista file dialogs to your current programs.<br /><br />The second article is <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/vista/VGTaskDialog.asp">Showing Friendly Messages with Task Dialogs</a>.  This exposes the new TaskDialog API which Microsoft want people to use for displaying information to users.  It&#8217;s all fairly simple, so it is extra Vista in your program for not too much effort.</div>

Microsoft have released XNA Game Studio Express 1.0.  This is a platform for developing  managed DirectX applications targeted at PCs and X-Box 360s.  The development environment is based on the Visual C# Express edition that Microsoft released earlier this year.  <br /><br />In order to develop for the X-Box 360 you have to join the <a href="http://msdn.com/xna/creator">Creators&#8217;s Club</a> at $100 per year.  You are not allowed to use it for commercial development on the X-Box 360, but you can for targeting Windows.  For commercial development on X-Box 360 there will be an XNA Professional version released some point next year.<br /><br />Currently Windows Vista and Server 2003 are unsupported, but then again Visual Studio 2005 is unsupported on Vista so it is no surprise.<br /><br />Certainly the quality of Microsoft&#8217;s development tools is pretty good of late, and they are giving a lot of applications away.  All of the Express Editions of the Visual Studio.NET are definitely worth checking out for development and provide a fast way to get up and running.</div>

The latest version of <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> has been released.  This is now version 2.1 with a host of new features.  You can see all the release notes <a href="http://development.openoffice.org/releases/2.1.0.html">here</a>.<br /><br />The main thrust of this version is to help push the <a href="http://extensions.openoffice.org/">extension technologies</a> (which originally appeared in 2.0.4).  They are trying to encourage the same level of extensions as with Firefox, whether this succeeds or not only time will tell.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve used OpenOffice.org since the betas of version 2 and it has always been solid and consistent, and I never fell into the trap I did with Microsoft Office where page formatting could change randomly.  The features of OpenOffice are more than adequate for all the uses that I have had for it (and it has meant that I don&#8217;t have to buy an MS Office licence).  I&#8217;ve used it for generating PDFs for printing magazines and it does the job fantastically.</div>

I&#8217;ve been racking my brains recently about triangle meshes and curvature.  The problem with triangle meshes is that they don&#8217;t really want to have decent normals defined for them, especially if your triangles have inflections between them from the generation.<br /><br />Someone who is much better than me at geometry pointed me at a really good article about normals and curvature from arbitrary meshes.  The article is <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/gfx/pubs/_2004_ECA/index.php">Estimating Curvatures and Their Derivatives on Triangle Meshes</a>.<br /><br />There are implementations of the ideas in the article in <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/gfx/proj/trimesh2/">trimesh2</a>.  It&#8217;s worthwhile taking a look at the source code (it&#8217;s in C/C++) and is fairly self-explanatory if not optimal.<br /><br />Calculating the normal on an arbitrary mesh is fairly simple if you don&#8217;t want to be accurate in the slightest.  Just take the average of the triangles that share the point.  This works fairly well if your triangles do not have inflections and they are divided into separate surfaces (or faces depending on your terminology).  The idea behind this paper is to look at regions of points and to get the average of these, but weight them for their distance from the point you are attempting to calculate.<br /><br />If you store this data it is only a one time calculation hit, so it will not slow down your program.  This type of calculation is perfect for 3D rendering, although I need to see the overall quality in order to determine if it can be used for applications requiring more accurate results like CAD/CAM.</div>

Sun have <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/">released Java SE 6</a> the latest version of Java for use in developing desktop and server applications.  This isn&#8217;t the GPLed version just yet as the development of version 6 just missed the boat.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.netbeans.org/products/">NetBeans is also available</a> as a free IDE for development.  It is an excellent quality IDE which now has a <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/products/cplusplus/">C/C++ plug-in</a>.  The C/C++ plugin is a bit new so it is not perfect by any means, but has just as much potential as the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">Eclipse CDT</a> project.<br /><br />I am going to try out more Java programming to see how far the GUI was away from looking platform native.  Hopefully, it is not too far away right now.</div>

<a href="http://www.laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)</a> is an initiative to try and get information technology to those children in the world that do not have it.  Some people think it is a great idea, others don&#8217;t but the merits of this project I don&#8217;t think can be measured until it is in full swing.  Hopefully it will be of benefit, after all anything is better than nothing.<br /><br />The <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Human_Interface_Guidelines">Human Interface Guidelines</a> have been available for a couple of weeks.  This covers &#8220;Sugar&#8221; the laptop user interface and how to develop applications for it.  There is a <a href="http://www.wildgardenseed.com/mike/olpc.html">great blog post from Mike Hearn</a> that extracts the essence of the guidelines.  It looks like there could be some interesting UI features on the little laptop.</div>

<a href="http://www.applegazette.com/mac/rumor-aqua-to-be-replaced-with-illuminous/">Apple Gazette</a> have posted a rumour that the OS X theme Aqua with something new codename Illuminous.  Macs have always had a great looking user interface with a real feeling of weight and it always feels complete and finished.  The rumour states that it is in response to Aero - the Vista UI theme, but I somehow doubt that is the case.  Vista&#8217;s UI feels confusing, lightweight, unfinished, and lacking consistency.<br /><br />Apple have put up some developer technology posts for Leopard.  There are currently three parts:<ul><li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/leopard/overview/tools.html">Part 1 - Developer Tools</a></li><li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/leopard/overview/">Part 2 - Technology Overview</a></li><li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/leopard/overview/apptech.html">Part 3 - Application Technologies Overview</a></li></ul>I&#8217;ve got to say it Apple always do a good job with their development documentation, even the promotional fluff.<br /><br />Update : More on Illuminous <a href="http://www.appleology.com/2006/12/10/leopards-illuminating-graphical-user-interface-illuminous/">here</a>.</div>

Last week <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/12/01/184205">Slashdot</a> drew attention to an article about <a href="http://www.beyond3d.com/articles/fastinvsqrt/">the origin of the fast approximation of the inverse square root in Quake 3</a>.  For anyone who likes obscure bits of code it is really quite interesting and I think really understanding the code does make you a better programmer even if you never use it.<blockquote><br />float InvSqrt (float x) {<br />float xhalf = 0.5f*x;<br />int i = *(int*)&x;<br />i = 0x5f3759df - (i>>1);<br />x = *(float*)&i;<br />x = x*(1.5f - xhalf*x*x);<br />return x;<br />}</blockquote>It computes the result using integer maths instead of floating point operations because back in the day that was faster.  This function does the operation to an approximation which is fine when it is used in graphics where the human eye finds it impossible to differentiate small changes in colour.  It is one of those functions where the more you iterate the more accurate the result it.<br /><br />It works by reinterpreting the float bit pattern as an integer then using bit shifting to get at the mantissa.  The &#8220;magic seed value&#8221; is an approximation of the result (it is easier to get a good approximation when the result is in a mostly predictable range).<br /><br />Anyway a useful tome about this kind of trickery is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAKMEM">HACKMEM</a>, you can read it online <a href="http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/hakmem/hakmem.html">here</a>.<br /><br />It would also be a good idea to check out <a href="http://www.hackersdelight.org/">Hacker&#8217;s Delight</a>.</div>
