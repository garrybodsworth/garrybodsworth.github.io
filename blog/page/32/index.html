<a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial (hg)</a> is one of the distributed revision control systems I looked at in a previous post.  I&#8217;ve been looking more closely at these shttp://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gifystems and thinking about how they fit in to the different development methods (closed and open source don&#8217;t normally need the same process).<br /><br />Interestingly there is a talk at Google from last year by one of the main developers Bryan O&#8217;Sullivan on Google Video:<br /><br /><embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-7724296011317502612&#038;hl=en" flashvars=""></embed><br /><br />Version 0.9.4 of Mercurial was released today adding a fair amount of bugfixes and new functionality.  It is a very interesting system as it is implemented in Python, is very efficient and is one of the best for cross platform support out of the distributed revision control systems (with an extension adding the support for Windows file endings).<br /><br />The commandline syntax is simple and easy to use.  It has a wide variety of additional tools and extensions.  Although these are not as mature or in-depth as other systems (like Subversion/CVS/and so on) they are providing a good basis.  Quite a few large projects are using Mercurial in production like Mozilla, OpenSolaris, Xine, and Xen.<br /><br />There is a great book about using Mercurial <a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/">here</a>.  It covers many of the concepts and simply how to use it.  The wiki based website and the mailing lists are also great sources of information.<br /><br />There seems to be lots of GUI tools but none providing full workflow support yet, but hopefully this will happen with time.</div>

<a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/"></a>Before I start I just want to say thanks to all the people leaving comments.  This post actually comes out of what Frabcus has left in the comments about distributed revision control.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been having a serious look into all the distributed revision control systems out there (well, the free ones at least) not only to understand the concepts of them but to see how easy they would be to use since they tend to lack the UI tools.<br /><br />Interestingly Mark Shuttleworth, Ubuntu founder has been discussing distributed revision control on his blog.  There are four posts <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/123">here</a>, <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/124">here</a>, <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/125">here</a> and <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/126">here</a>.<br /><br />But now to the subject of this post, the Tortoises.  First there was <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/">TortoiseCVS</a> which interestingly was started by an ex-NC Graphics employee <a href="http://www.flourish.org/">Francis Irving</a>.  Then there is obviously <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a>.<br /><br />So for these new distributed systems it looks like they are racing for Tortoise type implementations of user interfaces on Windows which would help to attract Windows developers.<br /><br />There is <a href="http://tortoisedarcs.sourceforge.net/">TortoiseDarcs</a> for <a href="http://darcs.net">Darcs</a>.  This is the most complete implementation for the distributed systems so far.  There are some good <a href="http://tortoisedarcs.sourceforge.net/screenshots/screenshots.html">screenshots</a> on the TortoiseDarcs website.<br /><br />For <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> (run by Canonical of Ubuntu fame and what Mark Shuttleworth was talking about on his blog) there is <a href="http://www.hl.id.au/Projects/tortoisebzr/">TortoiseBzr</a>.  It is using TortoiseCVS as a base to expand from.  There is also a placeholder on the wiki for Visual Studio integration.<br /><br />For <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a> there was an announcement on their mailing list that someone has started on <a href="http://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2007-April/012923.html">Tortoise-hg</a> and they ave a small set of functionality.  It hasn&#8217;t been publicly released yet, but hopefully soon.<br /><br />There is no TortoiseGit being looked at, but I think the Windows support requires work before that step is taken I suppose.</div>

I don&#8217;t know what frabcus is talking about.  I made a test repository and tested directory merges, and it seems to work fine.  Are you using &#8220;git mv&#8221; to perform the directory renames?  If not, that&#8217;s your problem.</div>

The thing is I think Git is perfect for Linus,but tat does not make it necessarily so for general use.  Watching teh presentation that Linus gave at Google it seems the merge problems are able to be the patch submitter&#8217;s problem rather than the maintaner&#8217;s, so the miantainer only ever does simple merging.<BR/><BR/>Garry</div>

Thanks for the link to Mark Shuttleworths blog. <BR/><BR/>I&#8217;m a bit stunned that Git can&#8217;t properly handle merging directory renames! Everyone until now has claimed that Git&#8217;s merge support was perfect - it seems like a major defect to me.<BR/><BR/>So that, combined with not being a proper library that is portable to other operating systems, sadly rules out Git.</div>

I&#8217;ve noticed a few commercial products have released free merge tools recently.  I&#8217;ll come onto them after the good open-source ones.<br /><br />I am a massive fan of <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/">KDiff3</a> which provides a very good 3-way merge and has saved my merging hide more times than I can remember.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.winmerge.org">WinMerge</a> is definitely the slickest merge tool for Windows, unfortunately it is only a two-way merge.<br /><br /><a href="http://meld.sourceforge.net/">Meld</a> is an excellent system but although it is cross-platform it really excels on GNOME.  The comparison looks great with the two sides connecting up.<br /><br />And now some commercial ones&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="http://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html">SourceGear DiffMerge 3.0</a> was released recently.

There has been no blogging for a couple of weeks because I was on holiday in America, then ill.  But now it is time to get back to blogging since plenty has happened in the world of computers during my break.  I have some emails to reply to from the blog and I will get around to those over the next few days.<br /><br />The best thing about going to America was to get a nice new Macbook Pro - one of the new revisions with the LED backlight.  The model I got was the bottom of the range 2.2GHz Core 2 Duo (4MB cache) 15 inch version, which now comes with 120GB of hard drive.<br /><br />The LED backlight has substantially increased the battery life of the Macbook Pros and the picture quality is astounding.  I got the matte look screen as it provides much better colour tones at a lesser intensity.<br /><br />And OS X - I should never have waited this long to switch to anything other than Windows.  It is astoundingly good.<br /><br />There will probably be more Mac content on the blog in the future but I will still be using Windows in other places so I will still be interested in development on that platform, but probably with a more cross-platform slant.</div>

Linus Torvalds did a talk about source control the other day, more specifically about <a href="http://git.or.cz/">GIT</a>.  Basically he has an immense dislike of centralised revision control.  You can see Linus&#8217;s talk here:<br /><br /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/4XpnKHJAok8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed><br /><br />Some Slashdot discussion is available at this <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/07/06/03/004214.shtml">link</a>.<br /><br />This kind of sent me into an Internet whirlpool looking at distributed revision control.  So this post will be all about that.  I must admit I have never really thought about it since I am so pleased with <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> and <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a>, although recent events have made me look into source control systems in general more closely.  At a high-level the distributed model has a lot of advantages in design and is capable of having a &#8220;central&#8221; server you sync against which means it can behave more like the centralised model.  On the other hand the centralised tools all seem to have much easier to use tools and have more powerful features (at least in Subversion) than they are given credit for due to their heritage.<br /><br />Mozilla development has switched to a distributed source control system recently.  They had a set of requirements like cross-platform, speed, stability and more.  Some more information can be read <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/preed/2007/04/version_control_system_shootou_1.html">here</a>. <br /><br /><a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> was started by Linus Torvalds because he was no longer able to use BitKeeper.  It has quite poor Windows support because it is reliant on a POSIX system but has a lot of powerful features.  There are some UI projects but they seem quite immature at the moment and only augment the command ine rather than replace it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mecurial</a> was chosen by Mozilla development for their revision control system, and in fact they have already switched to it.  There are apparently some speed issues in comparison to Git, but it has better cross-platform support.  There seems to be a few extensions including some <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> integration.  I am not too sure about the UI side yet.<br /><br />Other distributed source control systems include:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> - is a GPL based system.</li><li><a href="http://monotone.ca/">Monotone</a> - is another GPL system.</li><li><a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/view/HomePage">SVK</a> - A Subversion derived distributed system.</li><li><a href="http://www.darcs.net/">darcs</a> - yet another system.</li></ul><br /><br />Anyway these distributed systems seem to be getting traction with Mozilla, X, and other large projects starting to use it.</div>

Hey Garry, speaking of revision control and Subversion in particular: Have you created any updated toolbars/menus for Visual Studio Orcas yet?  The file context menu appears to be broken and I was wondering if I could pick your brain on how you created these so I could learn how to create my own ones for web site development.  Please contact me at tmilker at gmail dot com.<BR/><BR/>(sorry for the mostly off-topic comment, you do not provide any other means of contacting you)</div>

Yes, it is all about tools. <BR/><BR/>As far as I know none of the distributed version control systems have as good a set of, particularly Windows, interfaces as CVS and Subversion.<BR/><BR/>There is a TortoiseDarcs, however, and things are beginning to look promising.<BR/><BR/>when Subversion was started, it wasn&#8217;t obvious how distributed version control would work, or that it could work. Nobody was using it. Subversion can be forgiven for basically copying Perforce, the state of the art at the time in terms of version control functionality.</div>

There is an interesting talk on Slashdot about coding <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/07/05/30/1813247.shtml">here</a>.  It&#8217;s good to see that there is still occasionally some discussions about programming on there.<br /><br />The article is about <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-clear-code/?ca=dgr-FClnxw01linuxcodetips">Six Ways To Write More Comprehensible Code</a>.  It makes size points:<br /><ol><li>Comment well and often.</li><li>Use sensible names not obscure constants.</li><li>Use variables with descriptive names.</li><li>Do error checking.</li><li><a name="N101BF"><span class="atitle">&#8220;Premature optimization is the         root of all evil.&#8221; - Donald Knuth</span></a></li><li><a name="N101BF">Don&#8217;t be too clever.</a></li></ol><br /><br />The article is a nice little bit about writing better code.

ditto that on number 5.  <BR/><BR/>&#8220;comment well&#8221; is a bit of a tautology.  It&#8217;s like saying: <BR/><BR/>&#8220;Rule 1 for writing good code is to write good code!&#8221;<BR/><BR/>I&#8217;ve heard it said that comments are a crutch and a sign that you aren&#8217;t applying rules 2 and 3 properly.  Often we stick comments above distinct chunks or paragraphs of code.  This style recommends you split each paragraph into a little function of its own with a descriptive name.  <BR/><BR/>I also want it to be understood that not all variables are the same.  Often variables are structural &#8211; created on one line and passed as an argument on the next.  It&#8217;s a distraction to give them descriptive names.  They act as pronouns.  Like using &#8220;she&#8221; instead of repeating the name in the next sentence.</div>

The critically acclaimed <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/">X-Box Media Center</a> which is a HTPC program for the X-Box is planning to work on a Linux version.  Bizarrely some of X-Box Media Center inspired <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/">Media Portal</a>, the very good and comprehensive HTPC program for Windows.<br /><br />They are looking for C/C++ developers to help with the porting to another platform.  This will require substantial work to port the functionality requiring new playback engines, 2D and 3D graphics, and no doubt lots more.<br /><br />There is a thread on their forum for developers <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/forum/showthread.php?t=26097">here</a>.  There is a post on the forum for end users <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/forum/showthread.php?t=26097">here</a>.<br /><br />On their wiki the preparations are going along.  You can read this information <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Linux_port_project">here</a>.<br /><br />I have the sincerest hope this is successful because with MythTV out there things will be healthy for Linux HTPC programs.
