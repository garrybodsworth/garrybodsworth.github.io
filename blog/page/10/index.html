<div class="post-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing around with the EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) <a href="http://code.staikos.net/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=webkit;a=shortlog;h=kenneth/efl-port">port of WebKit</a> and I have been very impressed by the quality of the page rendering. In fact I have been playing around with Enlightenment E17 libraries, although I haven&#8217;t gone the whole hog and installed the desktop environment.</p>

<p>The quality of the building blocks that have been put together are extremely impressive with multiple rendering backends for the Evas canvas including X11, OpenGL, Windows and Quartz. It&#8217;s a highly optimised canvas to build UIs with. I&#8217;ve spent some time reading the source to work out how it all fits together. I liked the &#8220;buffer&#8221; backend for Evas that allows you to render to that engine and capture the output as a buffer of bytes, but in order to use it there was no massive difference in code.</p>

<p>But I digress, on my travels through the internet I found a few interesting projects related to Enlightenment e17.</p>

<p>First up there is a comprehensive skin for the Enlightenment areas that require it. It is called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/detour/">Detour (DTR)</a> and looks clean and consistent.</p>

<p>Next up I found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/itask-module/">iTask</a> (and its relations iTask-NG and WinList-NG) which are new taskbars for Enlightenment. These look good and provide integration with compositing with the NG versions.</p>

<p>Finally, the best thing I found was someone had put e17 together with the compositing of Compiz called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/itask-module/wiki/Stuff">ecomorph</a>. This is an alpha project but is showing some impressive results. There is a three part video : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHbQ0ASlzCQ">one</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G9hr-izzn4">two</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21VURWljN4A">three</a>. Also you can see a super dark demo <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5gDEiJpBwI">here</a>.</p>

<p>Enlightenment has not been at the forefront unfortunately because of a lack of official e17 release, but hopefully that will be rectified in the near future, mainly because a lot of the framework provided could be really useful (and it is a British thing to root for the underdog).</p>

<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.whitix.org/">Whitix</a> is a new desktop operating system that has just released a <a href="http://www.whitix.org/news/?p=23">0.2 version</a>. I hadn&#8217;t heard of it until today but it is interesting to see a few other operating systems out there.</p>

<p>It is aimed more at desktop users rather than techies as an ultimate goal. Still, it is early days and requires hacking abilities to be able to use it.</p>

<p>Essentially it is a new kernel written in C with some libraries ported to it to provide other functionality. The kernel itself is based mainly on Unix ideas but has decided to move some bits around to be more intuitive (like /usr/bin/ and the suchlike).</p>

<p>The graphics are based on <a href="http://alperakcan.org/?open=projects&amp;project=xynth">xynth</a>. The <a href="http://www.whitix.org/screenshots/">screenshots</a> look pretty good.</p>

<p>Obviously, it&#8217;s early days for the Whitix project but it should be interesting to see what it offers in the long term and how it differentiates itself as it matures.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Another month, another BCS SPA talk. The next SPA Cambridge meeting will take place on Wednesday 14th January at Microsoft Research Centre, Cambridge.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/WhyCantITProjectsBeInsured">Why Can&#8217;t IT Projects be insured?</a><br/>
<strong>Graham Oakes</strong><br/>
<em>January 14th 2009, 7:00pm (light buffet) 7:30pm (talk)</em><br/>
Venue: <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge">Microsoft Research Centre Cambridge</a></p>

<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>

<p>Many organisations, especially small to medium businesses and public sector bodies, are failing to initiate valuable projects. They read statistics such as the Chaos Reports and get scared of the risks of project failure. They talk to IT companies and get confused by the technical jargon. They don&#8217;t trust the consultancy industry to help them navigate this maze. So they don&#8217;t initiate projects that might actually deliver a lot of value. Or if they do initiate projects, they bound them with such tight &#8220;risk mitigation&#8221; practices &#8211; heavyweight procurement processes, long contractual negotiations, burdensome project oversight structures &#8211; that an atmosphere of mistrust and bureaucracy is built in from the outset. This, perversely, increases the risk of failure even further, creating the conditions for an escalating &#8220;cycle of mistrust&#8221;.</p>

<p>This mistrust hurts all of us. Organisations are forgoing potential benefits. Developers are forgoing potential work. Or if we do get work, it&#8217;s set up for failure from the outset.</p>

<p>In the film industry, insurance is used to mitigate some of this mistrust. Independent film producers often need to arrange &#8220;completion bonds&#8221; in order to obtain financing for their films. These are effectively insurance policies that projects will deliver on time and on budget. The financier pays a premium to an independent third party (the guarantor), who then monitors the project and ensures it stays on track. And if it doesn&#8217;t, then the guarantor repays the original financing.</p>

<p>Could this work for IT projects? This talk will look at the role of the guarantor, and the way they might help break the cycle of mistrust in many of our current IT projects. I don&#8217;t have definitive answers, but I do have some thoughts and many questions, so I hope we&#8217;ll have an interesting discussion.</p>

<p>Graham Oakes helps people untangle complex technology, relationships, processes and governance. As an independent consultant, he helps organisations such as Sony Computer Entertainment, The Open University, the Council of Europe and the Port of Dover to define strategy, initiate projects and hence run those projects effectively. Prior to going independent, he was Director of Technology at Sapient Limited, where he ran the project review process for the UK Business Unit. Before that he was Head of Project Management for Psygnosis Ltd (a subsidiary of Sony), where he ran Independent Project Assurance teams working across the UK, Europe and the USA. His book &#8220;Project Reviews, Assurance and Governance&#8221; was published by Gower in October, 2008.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) now has a <a href="http://codeposts.blogspot.com/2008/12/webkit-ported-to-enlightenment.html">port for Webkit</a>. It is not in the Webkit trunk or anything but it is available in git form <a href="http://code.staikos.net/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=webkit;a=shortlog;h=kenneth/efl-port">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried compiling it and using it on my Gnome VM and it works really well. The main missing parts are the NPAPI plug-ins rendering and the video tag support. Since this is an early stage all things will come in time (like video will probably use the Enlightenment Emotion engine). <a href="http://codeposts.blogspot.com/2008/12/webkit-efl-receives-its-first-patch.html">Patches</a> are also coming along.</p>

<p>What I like about Enlightenment and its libraries is that they are all well-defined meaning it has lots of rendering back-ends like DirectFB, Cairo, X11, OpenGL, and tons more. The libraries are all lightweight enough for embedded devices making them even more interesting.</p>

<p>There has even been some work about wrapping the Webkit rendering in a user interface (apart from the example one available in the WebKit git) and it has a really good name <a href="http://blog.gustavobarbieri.com.br/2008/12/22/webkit-efl-interface-prototype/">ewww</a>.</p>

<p>All of these guys have done great work so far and it looks like the start of something good.</p>

<time datetime="2009-01-04T00:00:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 4<span>th</span>, 2009</time>
</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>I am in the process of making my desktop computer into a work computer by removing Windows XP and going down the Ubuntu (8.10 Intrepid Ibex) route.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d share some of the problems I had just in case some other people find my solutions useful since from my Googling I notice quite a few people have some issues. I think also I made the problem a bit worse because I am using 64-bit on my Core2Duo.</p>

<p><strong>Problem #1</strong> : Can&#8217;t get my nVidia GeForce 6600GT to work with the nVidia binary blobs. I was using the latest out of the repositories and then tried the latest from nVidia and all I got was a blank screen and some not very helpful logs. I was getting seriously annoyed after hours of hacking at X configuration files and different nVidia drivers, almost to the point I was going to go out and buy an ATi in the hope open source or at least better drivers would be forthcoming.<br/>
<strong>Solution #1</strong> : The way I ended up having to solve it was using the <a href="ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/">Beta 1.80 drivers from nVidia</a>. Definitely not an ideal solution because I have now discovered problem #2.</p>

<p><strong>Problem #2</strong> : Songbird 1.0.0 won&#8217;t work. There are two places to get 64-bit debs for <a href="http://getsongbird.com">Songbird</a> which are both listed <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Songbird">here</a>. It won&#8217;t start though &#8211; bah! On closer investigation glibc is complaining about and invalid free() call. In the callstack you can see the <a href="http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=124972">culprit is the nVidia driver</a>. So now I have to ask myself do I want Songbird or a proper nVidia driver, but Firefox does work with no problems for me. There is also a report of the problem at the <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/songbird/topics/glibc_2_8_detects_invalid_free_pointer">Songbird customer service site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Problem #3</strong> : Sound didn&#8217;t work for my motherboard. I knew the chip and driver required which was a <em>snd-via82xx</em> (serves me right for using such a cheapskate sound solution). So a quick <em>sudo nano /etc/modules</em> and adding the driver name to the end of the file fixed that problem. It just needed a restart for the kernel to pick up the change.</p>

<p>But, enough about problems, I am very impressed now I have the basic system up and running. The desktop effects are extremely nice and non-intrusive. You need to install the &#8220;Advanced Desktop Effects Settings (ccsm)&#8221; and &#8220;Compiz Fusion Icon&#8221; to gain access to the UI for customisation. I did a few minor tweaks mainly to switch off wobbly windows and enable the Expose-a-like &#8220;Scale&#8221;. In general the user interface all looks great. If you don&#8217;t have the graphics card problems I have there is a good set of instructions <a href="http://reformedmusings.wordpress.com/2008/12/09/compiz-fusion-in-ubuntu-810-intrepid/">here</a> on getting the drivers and running Compiz.</p>

<p>I also installed Flash 10 (for x64) and it worked flawlessly. I even managed to watch the Dr Who announcement on the iPlayer Watch BBC One Now option. Flash does eat CPU but it seems to work fine apart from the fullscreen option on iPlayer. And obviously Firefox is as good as ever. I&#8217;ve installed <a href="http://www.screenlets.org/">Screenlets</a> and used the widget layer available in Compiz for the OSX-like Dashboard.</p>

<p>What I did next was to install <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox 2.1</a> using the <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads">repository method</a> (to override the ones available from Ubuntu). Then I proceeded to install Windows XP that was on this machine in the VM. After finding the right disk installation was faster than when it was actually on the hardware as were reboots. I am really impressed with this. It even activated first time!</p>

<p>Now I have a properly working system I can say that the 12 hours I spent (mostly trying to fix the unfixable) doing this was more than worthwhile because it boots fast, lets me work fast, and is completely controllable. The only hope I have is that there are some mature open-source video drivers (with 3D) out there in the future because then I will know which cards to buy for minimal hair loss. Also I swear the Ubuntu installation takes about ten minutes maximum compared to the unwieldy Windows installation.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>The main reason I have had my head down of late is that I have been beavering away at work on the next version of our <a href="http://camvine.com/products/coda">CODA system</a>. What is CODA? It is a digital signage system from <a href="http://camvine.com/">Camvine</a>, where you configure it all through the web and it&#8217;s ease of use.</p>

<p>We are gearing up to release the new web interface in the new year. This will be v2.0 where we leave behind the remnants of the engineering interface and have a full drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop experience all with a professional spit and polish. Also we will be rolling out the new client software which will add lots of new functionality.</p>

<p>Now we have released a new <a href="http://camvine.com/products/coda/screencasts">screencast of the new website</a> running with the new client software. You can see how to get a system up and running in three minutes, with things like monitor autodiscovery. The soothing tones of <a href="http://michaelandlaura.org.uk/~michael/blog/">Michael Dales</a> provide the voice-over.</p>

<p>The first video on the page shows you the general interface, the second video is the set-up in three minutes.</p>

<p>These are very exciting times at <a href="http://www.camvine.com">Camvine</a> as this platform is an excellent base to build off as well.</p>
