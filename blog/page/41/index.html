The new <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone">Apple iPhone</a> website has gone live.  This website details the new Apple device designed to be your phone, your music player, your camera, your life&#8230;<br /><br />The tech specs are:<ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Screen size</span> - 3.5 inches</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Screen resolution</span> - 320 by 480 at 160 ppi</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Input method</span> - Multi-touch</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Operating system</span> - OS X</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Storage</span> - 4GB or 8GB</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">GSM</span> - Quad-band (MHz: 850, 900, 1800, 1900)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wireless data</span> - Wi-Fi (802.11b/g) + EDGE + Bluetooth 2.0</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Camera</span> - 2.0 megapixels</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Battery</span>  </li><ul><li>Up to 5 hours Talk / Video / Browsing</li></ul><ul><li>Up to 16 hours Audio playback</li></ul></ul>The reason this device is not your average phone is it runs OS X.  There had been recent rumblings that Apple were going to have an embedded version of OS X and this is it.  It looks fantastic, I just hope it runs as well as it looks.  Being OS X you get Safari as your web browser, you can use desktop widgets, and it all looks great.  Hopefully this also means that developers can really go to town, with the benefit of Apple&#8217;s APIs and also being able to do cross-platform development.  Hell, this version of OS X even still supports multitasking.<br /><br />The interface has a keyboard and &#8220;multi-touch&#8221; the touchscreen user interface that is supposed to be really quite impressive.<br /><br />Enough drooling for today I think.</div>

After a nice vacation I think it is time to get back to blogging.  I managed to completely miss I posted my 100th entry last year as well.<br /><br />For this year though, looking ahead&#8230;<br /><br />More on my journey through the land on Windows Vista.  Much more on GUI toolkits.  An updated Subversion toolbar for Visual Studio 2005.  More open-source software that catches my fancy.  One of the things I&#8217;d like to look at more closely is KDE4 because there has been a flurry of recent information.  Hopefully, providing my wife will let me, I&#8217;ll be getting a new Mac, so hopefully I can wax lyrical about some splendid Apple products.<br /><br />There is probably loads more I can&#8217;t think of thanks to having a break from computers, but I will be aiming to keep up the post a day average.</div>

I was thinking about multiple cores, like you do.  One thing that most people haven&#8217;t realise is that they have been using multiple CPUs for years, one has been your CPU and the other is the GPU - your graphics card.  The graphics card is a very specialised computational unit, but it was added in order to offload processing from your main processor to something else to allow the processor to not get bogged down with graphics processing.<br /><br />Now with the advent of dual core machines and the upcoming (or released in small quantities) quad core machines, a lot of users will probably not know they are using only a fraction of their processing power most of the time.  Maybe it is time for the GPU to become one of those cores on the CPU?<br /><br />At the moment the most likely use for multiple CPUs on Windows is one core to run your antivirus and your antispyware software and the rest you can use normally&#8230;  At least that is what an article I read said multiple cores would be used for when they come out.<br /><br />As the programmable GPUs start to become more common in the next generation of graphics cards they are becoming more and more like a general CPU, so it must be possible for the CPU with multiple cores to have a core or two behave more like a GPU?  Certainly when the 8 core processors come out it would probably be quite nice to use multiple cores as the &#8220;graphics card&#8221;.<br /><br />I imagine though that there are people in labs much smarter than me already working on something like that or better.  It&#8217;s nearly 2007 after all and we are living in the future (well at least it sounds like the future to me) but we still have all of these different things cobbled together making up the current PCs.  It would be sort of nice to see lots of processing converge onto the single multiple core chip as now they are more than capable of doing the tasks whereas ten years ago we still had a processor that was only capable of multitasking in a single core.</div>

One of the biggest headaches in CAD/CAM is file formats.  In fact it is a complete nightmare.<br /><br />Every product out there tends to have its own proprietary format and they normally contain deliberate gotchas and obfuscation to try and prevent reverse engineering the formats.  Also if they provide a DLL to read the format they will deliberate hobble it as well as making sure you have signed some sort of EULA agreement.  That is if you can get to an agreement as if they know you have signed up with another competitor to read their format they might not be so forthcoming with their own.<br /><br />All in all it is the dinosaur&#8217;s way of doing things, especially in the day and age of open formats for things like Office Suites.<br /><br />There are open formats, and most CAD packages allow you to export your data in one of these defined formats.  But they rarely follow the formats correctly and throw away lots of information that would otherwise be useful, so you really want to use the original data.  The most annoying part is having to extrapolate the intentional and unintentional errors that deviate from the specification.<br /><br />Normally you will have to either reverse engineer the format yourself, manage to get a deal with the vendor of the product you want to be compatible with, or find someone who supplies the reverse engineering service as a library you can integrate.<br /><br />It would be so nice if there was a format that could be used for interoperability, but I think most companies like tying people down to their programs and it would require a sea change like what happened with OpenOffice and the Open Document Format (ODF).</div>

Testing is probably the first thing to go in commercial development as a preventative measure since it adds to development time and also adds to the cost of development.  Lots of companies do testing at a later stage like QA or beta testing, but it would be nice to iron out more kinks before we get to that stage, after all it is much more different to retrofit the fixes rather than designing the functionality correctly.<br /><br />One of the preventative ways of testing is unit testing.  This is a great way to stop regressions of behaviour as well as ensuring correct code.  Hopefully this would allow the developers to create well tested bulletproof base libraries that support the entire system with well documented behaviour.<br /><br />There is a great article you should check out reviewing unit testing frameworks : <a href="http://www.gamesfromwithin.com/articles/0412/000061.html">go read it here</a>.</div>

The WPF team has just blogged about a new feature in WPF which is 2D controls on a 3D surface.  Unfortunately the mapping happens within a standard window frame.

I never knew, but the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/default.aspx">Visual C++ Team has a blog</a>.<br /><br />One post piqued my interest - updates to MFC&#8230;  In the new version of MFC they are planning to allow the use of Vista style file open dialogs.  You can read the post <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2006/12/14/vista-style-file-dialogs-with-mfc.aspx">here</a>.<br /><br />This is good that extra functionality is being added to MFC since so many projects are no doubt saddled with legacy code.  It&#8217;ll make it fairly easy to get an integrated look without too much hassle.  This is apparently available through the Visual Studio Orcas builds.</div>

<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> is a popular development platform, kind of more than an IDE.  It is based solely around plug-ins and provides a good development environment.  At the moment most of its strength is the Java development and its use for embedded systems (see my previous article about SunSPOTs - that used the Eclipse IDE for remote debugging.<br /><br />One of the projects within it I keep an eye on is the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">CDT</a> project which is a plug-in for C/C++ aiming to be as strong as the Java development.  At the moment it is used a lot for the embedded space, but they want to extend it even further and challenge the <br />Visual Studio IDEs.<br /><br />The guy heading up the CDT project Doug Schaefer has been blogging about the progress of the project for a while.  In the CDT 4.0 roadmap the plan is to use the Windows SDK and have integrated debugging and the suchlike.  His most recent post <a href="http://cdtdoug.blogspot.com/2006/12/migrating-from-visualc-to-cdt.html">&#8220;Migrating From Visual C++ to CDT&#8221;</a> shows the progress the project is making.  It is always great to have alternatives and Eclipse certainly could help along that route.  Part of the plan is also to add C# support as well from the Windows SDK.  At the moment I would not recommend using CDT in lieu of VS2005 for Windows application development but if your toolchain is make based you may find this a better alternative.</div>

On the 13th December I attended the <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">Cambridge SPA</a> meeting.  Cambridge SPA is an offshoot (or part of) of the <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">BCS</a> and they hold monthly meetings for varied presentations about lots of aspects of computing.  I decided to throw caution to the wind and see what it was like (after all it was free) and it was hosted at <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge">Microsoft Research Cambridge</a> who generously provided the rooms and laid on a buffet.<br /><br />This presentation was about <a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/">SunSPOTs</a> which are small programmable Java devices.  It is defined as Java On The Metal since there is no operating system and Java does all of the control.  When you tell Java to sleep() the device also sleeps and it is extremely power efficient.  It uses the <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/squawk/squawk-rjvm.html">Squawk Java VM</a> which provides a version of Java ME functionality.  The device also has sensors built in like tilt and light sensors.  It communicates wirelessly or by USB.<br /><br />I got the impression that it still hasn&#8217;t found its true purpose yet, but is proving that Java is a good solution for the embedded environment space.  It also provides much better debugging facilities than traditional embedded environments.  Still, all very interesting.<br /><br />It was most interesting that my old haunt <a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk">Essex University</a> is using these devices.  And it was one of my favourite masters courses that was using it <a href="http://iieg.essex.ac.uk/">The Intelligent Buildings Group</a>.  It was bizarre to hear this since when I read about the presentation initially I thought this would have been ideal for Intelligent Buildings studies at Essex Uni.  When I did my dissertation there I was looking at the TINI Java embedded board for that although it didn&#8217;t amount to a great deal in the end.<br /><br />Still, I had a good time, met some people, got informed about an interesting subject, so all in all it was a good use of an evening.<br /><br />If anyone lives near Cambridge and is interested in computing in general, I can recommend you check it out.</div>

As an FYI, Squawk does not &#8220;provides a cut down version of Java ME functionality&#8221;, it provides full CLDC 1.1 and soon to be IMP 1.0 support.  Squawk is a very lean implementation of Java ME intended for small constrained devices with low memory.  It also runs on the metal, ie does not require an OS, which simplifies its portability and reduces its resource requirements.<br /><br />From the Squawk PI :)</div>
