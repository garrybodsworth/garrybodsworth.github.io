<div class="post-content"><p>Version <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/12/coltrane/">2.7 of WordPress</a> was just released, and being a bit fast on the draw I decided to install it. Using the Instant Upgrade plug-in it upgraded flawlessly as far as I can tell (cue the entire website imploding).</p>

<p>This upgrade breaks quite a few plugins because they are no longer necessary like the one I used to give the admin interface drop down menus.</p>

<p>The new administrative interface is good looking and well thought out. There are also plenty of <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/12/04/wordpress-27-features/">new features</a>.</p>

<p>So, if you see anything broken &#8211; let me know.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Last week Python 3.0 (nee 3000) was released with a big tidy up of the language.  Reading through the new features <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html">here</a> you can see plenty of shifting stuff around. It&#8217;s an interesting endeavor because you rarely get an opportunity to go back and correct the decay that inevitably happens. Since I am a newbie in the grand scheme of things to Python none of it looks particularly difficult to grasp or even change your code to do. I suppose if you have a large and crufty code base doing scary things it might be an issue.</p>

<p>A lot of bytes have been flying around the Internet either in support or more commonly against the Python 3.0 work. So for the prosecution you have posts like <a href="http://mooseyard.com/Jens/2008/12/python-30-whats-the-point/">this</a>, posts in the middle like <a href="http://www.cmlenz.net/archives/2008/12/py3k">this</a>, or the defence like <a href="http://sayspy.blogspot.com/2008/12/whats-with-30-hatin.html">this</a>. You do get <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/2to3.html">tools to help</a> and the <a href="http://sayspy.blogspot.com/2008/12/python-30-porting-docs-started-in-wiki.html">start of some docs</a>&#8230;.</p>

<p>The best thing to come out of the Python 3.0 release discussion is <a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2008/dec/05/python-3000/">this blog post</a>. I&#8217;m sure everyone who has had to work on legacy systems will know the monkeys, the cage, and the firehose. It&#8217;s always good to test that the firehose is actually on&#8230;.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>When I was at the University of Essex I won the Bowden Memorial Prize in my first year. Nothing too odd about that, but then in a magazine whilst I was at Uni I read an article that mentioned Dr Keith Bowden of the Computer Science Department dying in mysterious circumstances in 1982. My interest was piqued but details were hard to come by.</p>

<p>Even in the whizzy days of the Internet and more public access to archives I seem to only be able to find one article that mentions him. All other links all lead back to either the article or reproductions thereof.</p>

<p>It all relates to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative">Strategic Defense Initiative</a> (or Star Wars as it is better known). Apparently the scientists working on it started dying with alarming frequency of dubious circumstances. I don&#8217;t know if it is any more statistically interesting than any other sampling of people over the same period (so I am not peddling some conspiracy theory).</p>

<p>One of the articles can be found here &#8211; <a href="http://codshit.blogspot.com/2007/09/did-22-sdi-researchers-really-all.html">Did 22 SDI Researchers really ALL Commit Suicide?</a> From what I can tell noone ever bothered to actually try and research it and everything just reprints the same thing. It is pretty intere4sting though from the point of view Essex University had someone working on the SDI&#8230;</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a bit lax recently so I thought I&#8217;d do a whistlestop tour of the talks I&#8217;ve been to over the past month.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cambridgebusinesslectures.com/">Tim Campbell &#8211; Cambridge Business Lectures</a><br/>
Covered a lot of ground up from his start in business, through the Apprentice, up to his current venture. What you can tell from his talk is that he is doing what he wants to do now rather than what is expected of him. His current venture is a registered charity that helps young people start up business mainly if they are from disadvantaged backgrounds. I must admit business oriented talks don&#8217;t really do it for me and this was no exception because it always ends up being about the bottom line.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/WhenGoodArchitectureGoesBad">When Good Architecture Goes Bad &#8211; BCS SPA Cambridge</a><br/>
For the restart of the Cambridge BCS SPA meetings we have Mark Dalgarno&#8217;s talk. I&#8217;ve attended <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2008/04/accu-2008-conference.html">this one before</a>. The talk is an interactive session where you have to spot architectural decay and how to stem it and possible reverse it. It&#8217;s a good session for getting to know your fellow attendees as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.software-east.co.uk/">Model Driven Development and Software Product Lines &#8211; Software East</a><br/>
There were two talks for the fee here. First up there was <em>Danilo Beuche &#8211; Get started with Software Product Lines</em>. This covered the theory behind building up a software product line and also showed some of the tool that is used to manage it through Eclipse. It is much more relevant for companies with many products all containing small variations. The second talk was <em>Steven Kelly &#8211; Moving from Coding to Model-Driven Development</em>. This was the stronger of the two talks. The way I read it was that it is a large layer of abstraction to improve productivity and to ower thebarrier for entry for solving problems in the problem domain. The examples mainly involve diagrams (or UML) for it but I think a good DSL would do the trick as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chase.org.uk/?q=node/258">Liquavista &#8211; CHASE Cambridge</a><br/>
This was a talk about new monitor technology company and how you bring technology to market. It was about using electrowetting to make reflective displays (rather than the current backlit world). If the technology does take off you will get cheaper displays and lower power displays. They are currently pushing out actual product in watches in order to have something on the market rather than simply relying on being a technology and licensing company with no released product.</p>

<p>Upcoming there is <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/VisualStudioExtensibility">Visual Studio Extensibility: Extend Your Development Experience</a>.</p>

<h3>VSX: Extend Your Development Experience</h3>

<p><strong>Jean-Marc Prieur (Microsoft)</strong><br/>
<strong>December 10th 2008, 7:00pm (light buffet) 7:30pm (talk)</strong><br/>
<strong>Venue: <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge">MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge</a></strong><br/>
<em>Event sponsored by Red Gate Software.</em></p>

<p><strong> Synopsis: </strong><br/>
Microsoft Visual Studio provides a great set of development tools out of the box, but you may be surprised at how much more you can do with its rich extensibility platform. In this introductory session, we will give you a whirlwind tour of what the Visual Studio Extensibility (VSX) platform has to offer and how you can take advantage of it. Whether you are looking to increase you development team&#8217;s productivity, or you are looking for new business opportunities on the Visual Studio platform, this technical session will help you get started.</p>

<p><strong> Jean-Marc Prieur </strong><br/>
Jean-Marc Prieur is the Program Manager of Microsoft&#8217;s Visual Studio Extensibility Team. After studying at L’Ecole Supérieure d&#8217;Electricité (Supelec), and gaining a Master of Science at Caltech (focusing on Concurrent Computing and Computational Neural Systems), Jean-Marc worked for the French Navy managing Operational Research and Simulation. He is passionate about software modelling, in particular graphical software modelling, meta-modelling and code generating. He is also an extremely passionate early adopter of DSL Tools. Jean-Marc founded the French DSL community with a group of friends, which ran several labs, workshops on DSL Tools, and a VSX Day in Paris (<a href="http://www.dslfactory.org/" target="_top"><a href="http://www.dslfactory.org">http://www.dslfactory.org</a></a>). He joined the Cambridge Visual Studio Ecosystem Team in March 2008 as a Program Manager, and is working with the VSX team to add new features to DSL Tools and enhancing the Visual Studio SDK.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Well, actually more an interesting use of Webkit rather than Chromium I suppose&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/awesomium/">Awesomium</a> enables offscreen rendering of webpages by using the <a href="http://code.google.com/chromium/">Chromium</a> libraries which in turn are based on <a href="http://webkit.org/">Webkit</a>. Rendering to an offscreen buffer means you can embed the web content on things like OpenGL surfaces.</p>

<p>Currently the code only works on Windows (mainly because the Chromium source is not yet fully ported). The reason for using Crome over vanilla Webkit is that it uses its own rendering framework to deliver pixels from multiple processes to the main program window. This means you can use that rendering pipeline more easily because it is not so reliant on platform specifics and uses Skia to put the content together. From what I have tried to work out writing a backend for Webkit is a non-trivial process and tends to require lots of extra plumbing.</p>

<p>The latest version of Awesomium even lets you use the Flash plugin for extra rendering goodness.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>The latest version of the <a href="http://stlab.adobe.com/">Adobe ASL</a> open source C++ libraries was released on November 6th. It&#8217;s a great set libraries that give even more functionality beyond even <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a>.</p>

<p>The latest version also works with the latest 1.37 release of Boost and even contains the <a href="http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/">Intel Threading Building Blocks</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the libraries that are really useful are Move (providing move semantics for your classes), copy-on-write (only copy data when you need to, not by default), ABI safe containers, and the Forest container (for hierarchical data).</p>

<p>There are additional presentations and talks available for download <a href="http://stlab.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Papers_and_Presentations">here</a>. They are well worth having a read through as they present some of the concepts used in the ASL and some good insights into C++.</p>
