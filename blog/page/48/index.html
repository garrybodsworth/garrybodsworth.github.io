I reckon I am probably in the minority here, but I am less concerned about the code format of GUI toolkits.  I am more concerned about what it is capable of and what it looks and feels like.  After all it is more than possible to write an abstraction layer on top of it to hide some of the less nice features, and adapting to different styles is a learning process.<br /><br />Whilst screenshots can be misleading or more often understating the abilities of a toolkit, a well-defined example application is more than enough to decide whether to evaluate further.  With online type user interfaces it is much easier, whereas you need an executable to try things out for most others.<br /><br />It&#8217;s surprising how few go down this route as it is such a good way to show how good an application is on your platform.  I thought I would put together a list of some you can check out now.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/">JUCE</a> - The JUCE demos are downloadable <a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/download.php">here</a>.</li><li><a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a> - There is the wxPython demo available <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/download.php">here</a>.

Hi Garry,<br /><br />I have 1 more for your list. It is the Adobe Source Libraries (ASL) example. It isn&#8217;t obvious how to get it and use it, so:<br /><br />You can get it from their sourceforge download site here :<br />http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=132417&package_id=145420<br /><br />and for Windows, you want the asl_1.0.20_begin_win.zip file. Mac is available also.<br /><br />Unzip, and you will have an app called begin.exe.  Start it. It runs 1 example using their .adam and .eve files. To try out other UI examples, drag a pair of .adam and .eve files from the examples directory onto the main app window (the wide-short window), and it loads up a new window from the .adam and .eve form file specs.</div>

I&#8217;ve covered a variety of the areas for porting to Visual Studio 2005 in some previous posts, as it is not as simple as it should be.  It seems that although it is relatively easy to get it compiled there is a lot of performance and stability work to be undertaken.<br /><br />The posts are:<ul><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/boost-library-and-visual-studio-2005.html">Boost and VS2005</a></li><li><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/visual-studio-2005-lets-break.html">VS2005 floating point and STL</a></li></ul>There is also one area that needs looking at as you may notice you are not getting the Windows XP look and feel.  This is a pain because the way manifests work has changed.  You need to go to your <span style="font-style:italic;">stdafx.h</span> file or the main <span style="font-style:italic;">.cpp</span> file and add the following:<br /><br /><table style="font-size:75%;border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; background-color: #f9f9f9;"><tr><td><code><pre width=80>#if _MSC_VER >= 1400<br />#ifdef _UNICODE<br /> #if defined _M_IX86<br />  #pragma comment(linker,"/manifestdependency:\"type='win32' name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' processorArchitecture='x86' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*'\"")<br /> #elif defined _M_IA64<br />  #pragma comment(linker,"/manifestdependency:\"type='win32' name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' processorArchitecture='ia64' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*'\"")<br /> #elif defined _M_X64<br />  #pragma comment(linker,"/manifestdependency:\"type='win32' name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' processorArchitecture='amd64' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*'\"")<br /> #else<br />  #pragma comment(linker,"/manifestdependency:\"type='win32' name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' processorArchitecture='*' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*'\"")<br /> #endif<br />#endif //_UNICODE<br />#endif //_MSC_VER >= 1400</pre></code></td></tr></table>Just copy and paste this, the formatting will be correct.</div>

I&#8217;ve already covered the <a href="http://www.vcf-online.org/">Visual Component Framework (VCF)</a>, but I feel like talking about it a bit more.<br /><br />Before starting make sure you check out the <a href="http://vcf-online.org/docs/ref_manual/ch01.html">list of features</a> from the VCF documentation, as I won&#8217;t repeat them all here (after all it is what hyperlinking is invented for).<br /><br />There are three core libraries in the VCF:<ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">FoundationKit</span> - The base library for the VCF providing the lower level building blocks for the other libraries.  It provides the RTTI system, string support, threading, and much more.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">GraphicsKit</span> - It&#8217;s the library that provides the graphic rendering and graphics formats.  It has some great functionality from <a href="http://www.antigrain.com/">libAGG (The Anti-Grain Geometry Tookit)</a> which I have mentioined in some previous posts.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ApplicationKit</span> - The GUI functionality itself.  Obviously this is the largest component and covers the widgets, events, focus, and more.  It&#8217;s almost so big there must be a thought to break it down further into smaller functional components.</li></ul>There are more libraries (kits) that contribute functionality including HTML, OpenGL, the upcoming Regex, and a few more.<br /><br />One compaint I hear is that the libraries are too large (in file size) which I have never understood as an argument for or against a toolkit (unless we are talking MASSIVE).  It is rare that a toolkit has a small amount of dependencies, plus with the VCF you don&#8217;t need everything if you are into that (but it is obviously more work to do).<br /><br />I have found writing code in VCF is surprisingly concise and easy to understand.  If you have come from an MFC or wxWidgets background, the event system will need some understanding.  I was trying out writing something to simulate docking with a small amount of success, although I haven&#8217;t done as much coding for it as I probably should have.  It wasn&#8217;t more than a little experiment to try out something in the VCF.<br /><br />I probably should list the major features that it lacks, which are docking windows (and toolbars), fully implemented cross-platform support, scripting language bindings (<span style="font-weight:bold;">Edit:</span> There is a basic Javascript engine that has not made it into the release yet), and the finished documentation.<br /><br />The cross platform aspect remains incomplete for Linux and Mac although the Linux version has pushed on in the recent past.  Actually I find it a bit disappointing that it does not have a large community built up around it like some other toolkits.  The foundations seem so solid that the system is begging to be extended more.<br /><br />Make sure you read the documentation <a href="http://vcf-online.org/docs/ref_manual/">here</a> which is excellent although not comprehensive, and not completely finished.  Also check out the VCF articles on the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">CodeProject</a> (do a search for VCF).<br /><br />As you can tell I am quite positive about this toolkit, it is almost too understated for its own good.  I can imagine developing something quite complex in it and being able to extend it for more complex things.</div>

Just a note, we do have a basic JavaScript engine that the <a href="http://vcfbuilder.org">VCF Builder</a> uses. This is not in the formal VCF at the moment however.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Jim (ddiego)</div>

<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> is addictive, and gives a wealth of useful information, like 75% of the readers here use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Firefox</a>.  Firefox 2.0 comes the same week as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0</a> has arrived.  So there are two installation experiences to tell.<br /><br />IE7 starts installation by unpacking the installation to a temporary directory, and then begins some enforced Windows Updates.  Then it begins an unusually long installation (I am still not sure why), overall taking 10-15 minutes.  Then it needs you to reboot.<br /><br />I was going to wait for automatic updates to pick up Firefox 2.0, but I decided to upgrade now.  The installation was a case of blink and you&#8217;ll miss it.  No reboot.  A minor startup delay of about ten seconds due to checking the plug-ins for updates, and I was away.  The new UI takes a bit of getting used to visually, but I think I will end up preferring it, and it pretty much all works the same.  The tab shading is a bit unnecessary especially since the rest of the UI isn&#8217;t as shaded.  Check out a comprehensive review <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2006/10/firefox-2-review/">here</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&id=0&t=216"><img border="0" alt="Firefox 2" title="Firefox 2" src="http://sfx-images.mozilla.org/affiliates/Buttons/firefox2/firefox-spread-btn-5.png"/></a></div>

<a href="http://www.codeblocks.org">Code::Blocks</a> is a free open-source IDE written in <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a>, making good use of <a href="http://www.kirix.com/community/wxaui.html">wxAUI</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxflatnotebook">wxFlatNoteBook</a>.<br /><br />If you decide to give it a go make sure you use the <a href="http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=d5fa3b82510a71c14c07404cb09e1492&board=20.0">Nightly Builds</a>, you&#8217;ll need <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> to decompress the files as well.  The nightly builds are well beyond the last &#8220;release&#8221; called RC2.  I&#8217;ve found the nightly builds stable and mature.  There are lots of plug-ins and project templates.<br /><br />One of the major plug-ins that has recently gone through a major rewrite is the wxSmith plug-in which is a visual GUI designer for the IDE.  If this turns out to be good or even just average it would give Code::Blocks a major advantage for adoption.<br /><br />Code::Blocks is able to be the IDE for a variety of <a href="http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php?title=Installing_a_supported_compiler">compiler back-ends</a>.  I completely forgot to mention it is cross-platform.  It seems to scale up pretty well to larger projects, and can even convert your Visual Studio solutions.<br /><br />It also provides scripting through <a href="http://www.squirrel-lang.org">Squirrel</a>/<a href="http://wiki.squirrel-lang.org/default.aspx/SquirrelWiki/SqPlus.html">SqPlus</a> (which I&#8217;ve mentioned I like in a previous post).<br /><br />I must confess I am not currently using it, but I am using the Visual C++ Express Edition.  The only excuse I have is that I have Visual C++ set up perfectly for what I want to do.  If you are curious go and check it out, you won&#8217;t be disappointed.</div>

Yep, this is a pretty good IDE. If you develop with MinGW, this is THE IDE to use. I&#8217;ve never run it on Linux or OSX, so I can&#8217;t speak for those.<br /><br />But, I&#8217;m with you, VC++2005 is my favorite.</div>

As <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> development gathers speed more new features are appearing.  These look like add-ins that will become part of the core toolkit.<br /><br />First up there is <a href="http://www.kirix.com/community/wxaui.html">wxAUI (wxWidgets Advanced User Interface)</a> which provides a really nice and simple docking toolkit.  It has great looking hint boxes for docking and the ability to use transparency for drag effects.  It also has a notebook style tabbed interface built into it, and provides toolbar docking which is really top notch.  This is now part of the main <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=9863">2.7 development distribution</a>.<br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxflatnotebook"><br />wxFlatNoteBook</a> is a tabbed &#8220;notebook&#8221; interface much like what you see in Visual Studio (or indeed <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org">Code::Blocks</a> which uses it).  It has lots of professional looking rendering and custom drawn styles.<br /><br /><a href="http://wxforum.shadonet.com/viewtopic.php?t=10497">wxFlatMenu</a> has just been released on the wxWidgets forums.  This provides custom drawn menus much like what you see in Windows XP applications like Office and Visual Studio (both 2003/2005 and 2007 look).<br /><br />wxFlatNoteBook and wxFlatMenu have not been put into the main trunk, but there are plans afoot to integrate both into the wxAUI interface.  With this collection of very decent extensions it opens up wxWidgets to more possibilities.</div>

This is a fairly new toolkit on the scene, but that doesn&#8217;t make it particularly lacking.  I have been scouring the Internet for unbiased reviews of most toolkits before downloading them and it is seriously hard to find them.<br /><br /><a href="http://upp.sourceforge.net/">Ultimate++</a> is more than just a GUI toolkit (in fact I could probably say that about every single one I have looked at), it has an IDE, a build system, a visual designer, code-completion, code documentation, and its own standard library.  As a compiler back-end it can use <a href="http://www.mingw.org">Mingw</a>, Visual Studio Toolkit 2003, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/">Visual C++ 2005 Express</a>.<br /><br />It seems that you are unable to use your IDE of choice as Ultimate++ is more of a platform than simply a library.  TheIDE does allow you to simplify starting up development in Ultimate++ since you don&#8217;t have to worry too much about environmental setup and they don&#8217;t have to support multiple IDEs.  TheIDE is OK as a development environment, it lacks a plug-in framework that I could find but it does have a macro language.  This means integration of external development tools seems difficult which I find useful.<br /><br />The basis of Ultimate++ is the NTL which is a replacement for STL due to their perceived deficiencies for the project.  I honestly can&#8217;t say if it is a giant leap forward or reinventing the wheel, I&#8217;ve heard these arguments in the past that turn out to be null and void.<br /><br />But on to the most interesting part - the actual GUI Toolkit.  It has a fairly modest collection of widgets, not as deep as more mature toolkits.  I have noticed it is possible to get a fair amount of flicker from the projects when resizing and a simple solution didn&#8217;t immediately present itself.<br /><br />The user interface is not actually built on the common controls of the operating system, but is custom drawn, and as such in previous versions did not match the widgets of the underlying system in all cases.  This has improved massively recently (gone away completely I believe) thanks to a new Chameleon theming engine that uses the operating system UI theming engine (uxtheme on Windows).<br /><br />What I feel about Ultimate++ is that it is a decent new stab at something a little different to the other UI libraries by making it more of a platform.  I don&#8217;t think it is ready if you are evaluating it for use in a big application.<br /><br />For me when I read <span style="font-style:italic;">&#8220;Rapid development is achieved by the smart and aggressive use of C++ rather than through fancy code generators&#8221;</span> I thought it was interesting, but I always take this kind of stuff with a pinch of salt.  The code although shorter in a manner of speaking I don&#8217;t think is any more readable, and doesn&#8217;t really show any reduction in programmer thought or time (if you are comparing to more modern toolkits).<br /><br />The activity of the community seems fairly large, so they may be able to add functionality faster than other toolkits.  You can check out a fairly in-depth <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/IntroUpp.asp">getting started tutorial on the CodeProject</a>.</div>

&#8220;I have noticed it is possible to get a fair amount of flicker from the projects when resizing and a simple solution didn&#8217;t immediately present itself.&#8221;<br /><br />The solution is simple - call BackPaint method for your window.<br /><br />The reason why this is not default is that even on quite modern machines (like my one year sempron notebook with SIS graphics), there is percievable speed difference for BackPaint mode, so it is left up to the programmer if flicker free is more important than fast (with fast being the default).</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/07/tortoisesvn-and-visual-studio.html">See the update here.</a></span><br /><br />I&#8217;ve made an update to the TortoiseSVN integration for Visual Studio 2005.  This is from a comment by Dean about adding a solution to the repository.  This has been added to the menu, toolbar, and context menu for solutions.<br /><br />Unfortunately this update has only been tested on Visual C++ 2005 Express for the moment as this is all I have to hand, but I am pretty sure these settings should also work for Visual Studio full versions (see the link at the end of this post).  I&#8217;ll update the Visual Studio 2005 Pro versions at some point during the week, or discover I don&#8217;t need to and only maintain one file (which would mean not going grey as fast).<br /><br />You can read the original article <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/tortoisesvn-vsnet-2005-good-stuff.html">here and see some screenshots as well</a>.<br /><br />You can download the .vssettings for Visual Studio <a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/SubversionSettingsVC2005Express.zip">here</a>.</div>

Today I discovered a great little program called <a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/">Songbird</a> which is an open-source rival to <a href="http://www.itunes.com">iTunes</a>.  In some of my previous posts I&#8217;ve been going on about the web GUI, allowing the browser to be come the front end.  Although this looks like a really good project it probably doesn&#8217;t go the whole hog as it is a web-browser in itself.<br /><br />It uses the Mozilla libraries as a foundation to build a web-browser with integrated music/media functionality, or maybe it is media program with an integrated web-browser?  The advantages of using the Mozilla framework is that it is cross-platform and it is a proven technology.  It is also designed around the Firefox design of a core product with extensions to add functionality.  To that end there are plug-ins for iTunes libraries and syncing iPods.  One of the driving forces behind it is the guy behind the original WinAmp.<br /><br />All of the artwork produced for the site is excellent quality and highly amusing(!) which wins points with me.  Maybe I&#8217;m just shallow.  I&#8217;ll be watching this project though as it is really an interesting integration of a heavyweight application and the web.
