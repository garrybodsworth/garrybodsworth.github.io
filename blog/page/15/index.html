<div class="post-content"><p>A while back I used to do a lot of illustration, and I just realised that hardly any of it is out there on the Internet any more. So I&#8217;ll be posting some of it interspersed with my usual developer ramblings.</p>

<p>This post is for an illustration that ended up on the back cover of <strong>Transformers: Alignment Volume 1</strong> which was a special story bookending the Transformers comics mythos written by Simon Furman. This magazine was designed by <a href="http://www.the-hub.co.uk">Graham Thomson</a> and was an exclusive for <a href="http://www.transforce.org.uk/">Transforce 2001 run by Paul Cannon</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve put up two versions &#8211; one has a simplified background which I think looks much less cluttered, but the WarWorlds you can see flying through space are part of the story. I&#8217;ll scan in the original black and white image as well to show some of the process in the colouring when I can find an A3 scanner. The images on Flickr are 1600&#215;1200.</p>

<p>The image was inspired by this passage in the original treatment by Simon Furman:</p>

<blockquote><p>Cybertron, three hundred years after Unicron:</p>

<p>Much has changed.</p>

<p>Led by the insane warlord GALVATRON, the Decepticons have built and mobilised a vast fleet of Warworlds; moon-sized ships with awesome destructive firepower. In order to safeguard Cybertron, the Autobots have relocated their world, using technology appropriated from former Decepticon general Jhiaxus to clone other ‘Cybertrons’ from barren, uninhabited (non-metal) worlds. These decoys serve both to mislead and divide the enemy, but new intelligence has led the Decepticon fleet tantalisingly close to the location of the real Cybertron. A massed Autobot armada engages the Decepticons at Pinea Omicron in an attempt to end the conflict once and for all. Huge losses are sustained by both sides, and OPTIMUS PRIME finally destroys Galvatron… but at considerable cost to himself. Severely wounded, his power reserves decimated, he hovers at death’s door and the Autobots place him in protective stasis.</p></blockquote>

<div class="post-content"><p>Sometimes you look at where you are now and think &#8220;How did I get here?&#8221;, currently it is in a good way but certainly in difficult times you think &#8220;How the hell did I get here?&#8221;. Certainly thinking back to when I started working as a developer I would never have predicted I&#8217;d be doing what I am now.</p>

<p>Back in 2000 I started out as a C++ developer on Windows for user interface work. The user interface was MFC which will strike fear into the hearts of some programmers, and the source control system was Visual SourceSafe (bear in mind the initial release of Subversion was around the same date I started). This was the initial baptism in commercial realities of development and my first interaction with real talented developers who actually got software out of the door.</p>

<p>In 2002 I experienced my first takeover. My job description didn&#8217;t really change although I wasn&#8217;t a graduate any more. The type of development work I was doing was moving out of the original GUI type work into a more generalised area. Even at one point I ended up deploying a bug database company-wide running a custom version of Bugzilla, which was equal parts interesting and a complete nightmare.</p>

<p>In 2005 I went back to my original company, and this was where my development career started to get much more interesting. During that time I worked on the building blocks of the system and dipped into areas that would not have been seen as my comfort area like the serious heavy maths. I ended up trying to learn more and push myself, after all people out there have solved the same problems, so I joined <a href="http://bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">SPA Cambridge</a> and <a href="http://accu.org">ACCU</a>. During this period at work I moved the company over to Subversion, re-vamped the build system and installer, and got the 64-bit release done.</p>

<p>After another takeover I decided it was time to move on again, and to hopefully continue learning. Unfortunately this move didn&#8217;t work out, although I did pick up a couple of things during that time, and learnt a bit about what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>This leads me to my current job at <a href="http://www.camvine.com">Camvine</a> where I am learning lots of new stuff. This means I am having a huge amount of fun. Also, because it is a start-up, the company is of a size and mentality that makes me feel at home. In the space of about ten weeks(ish) I&#8217;ve had to learn Python, new technologies, lots about networking, and (finally) lead an almost Microsoft free lifestyle.</p>

<p>So, since starting my professional career in October 2000, in (almost) October 2008 I am getting to do work I suppose I would have dreamed of if I knew it was what I wanted to do. I think it shows that your career can evolve into unexpected and exciting areas.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com">AppleInsider</a> have put up a very interseting article about iTunes and accessibility:<br/>
<a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/09/27/apple_makes_itunes_8_itunes_u_content_accessible_to_the_blind.html">Apple makes iTunes 8, iTunes U content accessible to the blind</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Apple has volunteered to work with the state of Massachusetts to make iTunes 8 and the new iPod nano fully accessible, unlocking music, movies, and the free lectures and other educational material in iTunes U to blind users.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is fantastic news as accessibility online is extremely important, especially as there is a move away from physical products in certain industries. With the iPod Nano 4G they have added more options with large fonts access and a spoken interface. Pairing that up with a more accessible iTunes will make it the best digital delivery platform for the visually impaired, especially since most other fully targeted solutions look like hell and are normally a few generations of technology behind.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>So I was having a bit of an unhappy time attempting to get GTK+ to compile successfully. My determination has finally paid off and I got it to work.</p>

<p>As it turns out I built Glib and GTK+ from their respective trunks so I could guarantee they were in sync. But what I was trying to achieve was to use a Git master tracking branch and I finally discovered my own ineptitude:</p>

<p><code>git pull . master</code></p>

<p>It is your friend and pulls the changes from the master and applies them to your branch. I then tried to compile it and it worked! So I now have a compiled version of <a href="http://nanosleep.org/wiki/GTK%2B_Indirect_Renderer">GTK+ that can run on a headless server</a> with absolutely no X server dependencies. Now I just need to experiment with the library.</p>

<p>I wrote down all the notes on how to compile your own GTK+ so I will post those online in the hope I will save someone else losing their hair.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>For a couple of weeks I have been playing around with Qt and GTK+ at fairly low levels, attempting to get some low level pixels and other things.</p>

<p>What I discovered on these travels is that Qt is much faster to get up and running (with a simpler build system that works more or less straight away) whereas GTK+ is much more difficult to get started with (unless you are using the packages supplied with your distro).</p>

<p>Then it swings back the other way because with Qt you have less access to the low level functionality or those types of interfaces that are exposed are not quite powerful enough. With GTK+ it certainly seems a bit more configurable in that respect, say for writing a new backend.</p>

<p>A good piece of news about GTK+ is that there is now a native OSX version <a href="http://www.gtk-osx.org/">GTK+OSX</a>.</p>

<p>Also, an enterprising developer has created a new indirect rendering backend with no reliance on an X-server (very handy for testing and the suchlike) which can be found <a href="http://nanosleep.org/wiki/GTK%2B_Indirect_Renderer">here</a>. The GTK Indirect Renderer sends the pixels to a Cairo surface so you can wrap them round strange OpenGL things or put them in SDL.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Sometimes programming makes you feel like you are losing your marbles. Over the past few days I have lost many hours of my spare time attempting to compile a branch of GTK+.</p>

<p>I went down the obvious route of installing the development libraries with apt-get and then attempting to compile the source code. That, needless to say did not work at all.</p>

<p>Next up I tried the suggested method of jhbuild, the package available in the Ubuntu repositories. I just ended up with multiple versions of glib all conflicting with one another.</p>

<p>Next up I tried building jhbuild from its source. Building jhbuild was pretty simple, and then I tried to bootstrap and compile GTK+. The pain then came that hidden deep within the logs it wasn&#8217;t installing the version of Cairo necessary for Pango, so I attempted to find my way around that which meant I ended up in library hell. It was so damn close though as it was only GTK+ left to build and there was a compilation error because something was missing from Glib to do with emblems &#8211; so close and yet so far. It seems to you need some libraries installed on your system as well as the ones that are constructed as part of jhbuild.</p>

<p>I persevered with lots of combinations, time and hard work, and still I didn&#8217;t manage to get it to compile. It&#8217;s a bit depressing to be defeated by a build system, but it seems to have grown so massive and baroque that it is a large barrier to entry. The thing was I really wanted to mess around with one of the git branches of GTK+.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I think I have mentioned before the merge hell you can hit in <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> like other source control systems. What you really need in that instance is a good merge tool to make it easy. When I used <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> on Windows I used <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/">KDiff3</a> which did most merges automatically and made three-way merges pretty painless.</p>

<p>With Git on OSX the default mergetool is the built in file diff, which is pretty useless when it comes to merge hell.</p>

<p>I followed the KDiff3 integration article <a href="http://notch8.com/articles/2008/06/06/kdiff3-git-win">here</a> but there is some kind of bug in KDiff3 that means that it does not save the files correctly even if you set up the merge manually.</p>

<p>However, there is good news with <a href="http://blog.logicalrand.com/2008/9/9/use-p4merge-or-diffmerge-with-git-mergetool-on-os-x">this logical.rand article</a> which shows you how to integrate <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/">Diffmerge</a> or <a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/products/merge.html">p4merge</a>. Both of these tools are very polished on the Mac and means merge hell manages to become much more manageable.</p>
