<p>It&#8217;s nice and simple to use, even offering photoblogging facilities. I like the pared down nature of it because it simply lets you write. It could do with some tweaking in the how to publish or save drafts department though.</p>

<time datetime="2008-08-14T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 14<span>th</span>, 2008</time>

<div class="post-content"><p>A couple of years back when migrating from Visual SourceSafe to Subversion for NC Graphics I decided to piggyback an install of <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> onto the Apache install (I was using it to serve Subversion and it worked a treat). Initially it was just me playing around with it with some feedback from others. At some point we decided to use the wiki for internal documentation and Tristan Day took on the mantle of Benevolent Wiki Dictator. Without him the wiki wouldn&#8217;t have been as well organised or useful.</p>

<p>We put everything on there including Tristan&#8217;s horrific task of porting over old documents that were in various formats like Word or text. When they were online and it was the way they were supposed to be edited they became &#8220;living documents&#8221; that are continually updated. Some areas became repositories of information for what we were currently working on and what was done with some very nice tabe formatting.</p>

<p>It also meant the information was available anywhere with an Internet connection and since it was up to and was well presented if anyone had a question we could say &#8220;look at the wiki&#8221;. The wiki pages were even used for management presentations because it clearly showed our project progress and planning.</p>

<p>One of the things I do nowadays is whenever I do something and make a note of it, say a development process or carefully constructed command line, I put it in the wiki. I do that rather than having loads of notebooks because they are also useful for other developers, even the noddy stuff. The problem is you do need a housekeeper or Benevolent Wiki Dictator to keep it all well organised.</p>

<p>The thing is once you have reached critical mass with the documentation on a wiki then it takes on a life of its own and becomes a communal and extremely important resource. They get even more interesting when you have something like <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> or <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> that integrate bug tracking and source control (and more via plug-ins).</p>

<p>The types of things you should have on a development wiki are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting Up A New Computer &#8211; A well defined process for when you have a new starter that they can follow.</li>
<li>Setting Up A Development Environment &#8211; What you need to do to build and run a product.</li>
<li>Debugging Information &#8211; How to debug the system.</li>
<li>Coding Guidelines &#8211; Which have to be kept up to date making them perfect for a wiki.</li>
<li>Software Licences &#8211; An audit of licences (like GPL etc) used to achieve a product. It&#8217;s always important to know this information.</li>
</ul>


<p>There is tons more but you get the idea of where to start.</p>

<time datetime="2008-08-12T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 12<span>th</span>, 2008</time>
</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>I used to track what was going on in <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> very closely because I was in the CAD/CAM industry and 3D graphics are important there. It doesn&#8217;t seem that the changes were as radical as everyone was expecting as it was mentioned that there was a new object model being designed (I seem to remember <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/11/opengl-future-looks-rosey.html">blogging about it</a> nearly two years ago).</p>

<p>You can see the proposed specification from the <a href="http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/article/vol004_1/">OpenGL Pipeline Newsletter 004</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently certain developers are furious about it with some very long and vitriolic discussions. If you really want to inflict them on your brain you can see them <a href="http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=243195&amp;Main=45784#Post243195">here</a>, <a href="http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=243193#Post243193">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=504547&amp;PageSize=25&amp;WhichPage=1">here</a>. It seems the games developers are making the CAD industry scapegoats for any of the problems with the process.</p>

<p>It may not be the radical change but it is at least incremental, and provides a basis to deprecate and add some functionality. I still like the simplicity of using OpenGL, but then again I was never trying out any of the cutting edge features available on the graphics cards. OpenGL and OpenGL|ES are still being used on the Mac, Linux/Unix derivatives, Nintendo (DS and Wii), Playstation, and the iPhone.</p>

<p>You can check out a summaries <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=opengl_3&amp;num=1">here</a> and <a href="http://liquidat.wordpress.com/2008/08/11/opengl-30-released/">here</a> for the main changes with the full spec <a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec30.20080811.pdf">here (PDF)</a>.</p>

<time datetime="2008-08-11T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 11<span>th</span>, 2008</time>
</div>

<div class="post-content"><p>During the <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCamb-2">Barcamb</a> talk &#8220;Panic-Driven Design&#8221;, I realised that it was an umbrella for a whole host of wrongheaded &#8220;something-driven design&#8221;. The one I coined during the talk was one of my pet peeves which is Tickbox-Driven Design.</p>

<p>Tickbox-Driven Design is a close relation of Marketing-Driven Design, it is driven by market conditions and the competitors that you have. It involves having to tick off features that are &#8220;essential&#8221; to be able to sell (in the perception of marketing/sales), they don&#8217;t have to be good, or even complete, but they have to be there yesterday. If a competitor has a certain feature it simply has to be implemented by even diverting resources. These features tend to be poorly specified and probably don&#8217;t even address the underlying requirements.</p>

<p>When tickbox driven design takes over you are constantly playing catch-up and not innovating, and the longer it goes on the harder it becomes to break the cycle. It normally suggests that the problem can&#8217;t be solved by development alone.</p>

<p>As the development tends to be rushed, poorly specified, and pointless (not the greatest motivating factor when you are the person attempting the implementation) the overhead of maintenance becomes much greater than expected. It can also severely affect morale because you constantly have the perception that your product is no good and behind the curve, when in reality it isn&#8217;t always a lost cause.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>PyCon UK is a convention for the Python programming language in sunny old Birmingham. This year it is from the 12th to 14th of September and it only costs £75 for all three days.</p>

<p>Now I am using Python every day I think maybe I should attend this year. Looking at the talks that are going on it should be an extremely interesting conference. For a start they have <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/">Mark Shuttleworth</a> (of Canonical/Ubuntu fame) and <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/">Ted Leung</a> to deliver the keynotes.</p>

<p>So far the talks scheduled are the tutorials one Friday which include PyQt4, Django, and Google App Engine. The Django talk will be hosted by <a href="http://www.jacobian.org/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a> who is one of the benevolent dictators of the project (and creator) and he will be outlining version 1.0 (due in September).</p>

<p>The accepted talks can all be viewed <a href="http://www.pyconuk.org/talk_abstracts.html">here</a>. It certainly looks like there is a lot of variety.</p>

<p>Last year <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/">Julian Todd</a> did a talk on <a href="http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/">Public Whip</a> and I believe an impromptu one on CAM development. It was a shame to miss those.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>A week ago I attended the second <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCamb-2">BarCamb</a> (which is the Cambridge name for <a href="http://barcamp.org/">BarCamp</a>) which is an interactive conference where the attendees create the schedule.</p>

<p>It was hosted at the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Sanger Institute</a> which is part of the very impressive Wellcome Trust Genome Campus.</p>

<p><strong>The Chip With Potential</strong><br/>
To be honest this talk was over my head but it was about a new way of testing blood at a much lower cost than traditional methods.</p>

<p><strong>Panic-Driven Design</strong><br/>
This was an interactive session, where ideas from the crowd got divided into Test-Driven Development and Panic-Driven Development. It did get sidetracked for a while when exploring the deficiencies of TDD, but it was much more fun to go into where development goes wrong.</p>

<p><strong>SWIFT</strong><br/>
Currently the Wellcome Trust use a proprietary system for genome analysis which has a number of shortcomings. So they embarked on a new system that is open-source and written in C++ to be as performant as possible. It sounds like it is a good step forward with such a large contribution in an industry that tries to be very secretive as to its methods. Sounds like it will save money and time when it is online.</p>

<p><strong>It&#8217;s Too Much Information For Me</strong><br/>
Related tot he previous talk, this one talks about the output. The system currently used generates 11,000 PNG and text files for each run bearing in mind there are numerous simultaneous runs. You are ending up with 320Tb of data to sift through. This talk was a story of attempting to parse porrly formed data that people may not even want to look at. Then when the SWIFT system comes online most of this intermediate information will not be generated.</p>

<p><strong>Talking About talks.cam</strong><br/>
<a href="http://talks.cam.ac.uk/">talks.cam</a> is a website that aggregates the talks happening in Cambridge, both for the University and in general. This looks like a very useful resource. Some of the talk went into plans for the future including trying more integration with social networking for education.</p>

<p><strong>The Wireless Epidemic</strong><br/>
This was a talk from an academic paper looking into the propogation of data using only wireless devices. Basically the devices become routers and forward packets when they have the ability to do so due to proximity. Part of this was a study into the movement of data within a group rather than a completely random pattern as most of the simulations have used in the past. I think <a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2005/paper-HuiCha.pdf">this</a> is a related paper to do with pocket-switched networks.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis Workflows</strong><br/>
Using Rakefiles (Ruby Makefiles)</p>

<p><strong>Coda Demo</strong><br/>
A demonstration of <a href="http://www.camvine.com">Camvine</a>&#8216;s Coda system for digital content delivery (that I am now working on). This talk went really well and we let the attendees have access to the screens for the rest of the day which meant we had &#8220;about&#8221; screens for the talks from this point on. It even had my Feedburner API interface page to who the number of readers, unfortunately my blog showed zero subscribers <img src='http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

<p><strong>The Cloud And The Community</strong><br/>
Attempting to bring the community interaction online like Neighbourhood Watch. Unfortunately the take-up hasn&#8217;t been too high possibly because of the technical ability of the members of the community.</p>

<p><strong>Embedded Can Do The Internet Too</strong><br/>
This was a really good talk about small computers that are used as microcontrollers. They can even support a webserver. Some of the applications were power monitoring and supplying the information via a webpage. Simon can sum it up better on his blog <a href="http://mookstar.wordpress.com/2008/08/08/barcamb-2-embedded-can-do-the-internet-too/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What Bjork Has Done For Us (Tangible User Interfaces On The Cheap)</strong><br/>
Since swishy multi-touch is all the rage, this talk was about hacking up a tangible UI for musical purposes (or chemistry purposes for laying out molecules). You can hack up the UIs using <a href="http://reactable.iua.upf.edu/?software">reacTIVision</a> which is open-source.</p>

<p><strong>Distributed Version Control With Git (Panel)</strong><br/>
This was unfortunately the weakest talk of the day, but I think that happens when you choose a fashionable topic with a fashionable solution. I actually started daydreaming because I forgot to go on a rant about my merging problems of the week.</p>

<p>I also remember the talk about superimposing the government&#8217;s statistical data onto Google Maps (unfortunately I forgot to write down the title) which was an excellent talk. It was interesting to see coloured maps of people&#8217;s age ranges in the UK. Unfortunately the developer had to jump through a number of API and data hoops just to get what should be freely available Google Maps information (like polygon areas of the counties or parishes).</p>

<p>Overall it was a great day with a very high quality of talks and I am looking forward to next year&#8217;s.</p>
