This is a sad thing to get me excited but Microsoft seems to have been keeping something up its sleeve for Visual Studio 2008.  Normally nothing is a surprise with Microsoft and I had assumed that we had seen all we would from VS2008 in the latest beta.<br /><br />As it turns out they have a massive update for MFC dropping for Visual Studio 2008.  It had been alluded to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/08/08/visual-c-futures.aspx">here</a> and <a href="http://herbsutter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212D4327CC297151BB%21278.entry">by Herb Sutter here</a>.  I assumed that we would have to wait for the version after VS2008 since the beta was largely the same as VS2005.<br /><br />At Technet 2007 in Spain there is a talk:<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Title/Code: TLA404 MFC Updates for Visual Studio 2008 and Beyond  <br /><br />Presenter: Ale Contenti  <br /><br />Abstract: This session will demonstrate the new features added to MFC in Visual Studio 2008, including support for Vista Common Dialogs, Vista Common Controls, the Microsoft Office 2007 Look and Feel (including support for an Office Ribbon style interface), Office and Visual Studio style Docking Toolbars and Tabbed Documents. We will also talk about our plans to evolve the MFC library for Visual C++ 10 and beyond. This is an in-depth session designed for experienced C++/MFC programmers. (C)   <br /></span><br /><br />Do a search for the speaker <a href="http://www.mseventseurope.com/OnlinePub/Public/sessions.aspx?EventId=HbLEvtKcPE4%3d">here</a>.<br /><br />So it looks like the people using MFC will be getting some very powerful UI features as standard.  I&#8217;m not so bothered about Vista standard controls but more powerful docking would be very nice and would go hand in hand with tabbed document interfaces.  The most exciting part is the Office 2007 look &#8216;n&#8217; feel along with the ribbon user interface (is it RibbonBar? I don&#8217;t know&#8230;).  I guess we will find out more in November but this is good news for people maintaining MFC systems.</div>

I mentioned a couple of posts back that I was going to put some thought into GUI subjects and maybe trying out writing a simple toolkit.<br /><br />I was thinking abut which way to jump with trying to write a toolkit.  First of all what should it be based on?  Should it just wrap Win32?  Cocoa?  Should it be entirely implemented on top of OpenGL from scratch?  Should it be cross-platform in design?  Just these questions could cause anyone to run away screaming.<br /><br />Thinking about building it on top of OpenGL I encountered a couple of interesting GUI libraries <a href="http://glui.sourceforge.net/">GLUI</a> and <a href="http://glow.sourceforge.net/">GLOW</a>.  In these projects the windows are completely rendered by OpenGL which is an interesting approach.  I suppose <a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/">Juce</a> is built from similar roots as well where it implements its own toolkits.<br /><br />I was thinking about writing a nice C++ wrapper for Win32 but then I started to think even Microsoft products don&#8217;t use the standard widget rendering.  Then you start to think about built in custom drawn widget rendering, then you think why are you using standard widgets&#8230;<br /><br />The whole idea about implementing a simple GUI toolkit is an education about the design decisions and pitfalls that you can get into.  You also need to decide which subset you decide to implement first.  The problem is most toolkits go for the same 10% and that is normally as far as they get.<br /><br />The main idea I want to try out for an experimental GUI toolkit is some DSL (domain specific language).  What I mean is embedding a language in C++ in order to implement the user interface in a readable fashion.  It is certainly possible using modern C++ idioms as demonstrated in Boost.  I suppose the type of thing I want to do is (in some kid of C++ like pseudo code):<br /><pre><br />dialog(...) +<br />widget<static>("Number", sizeX, sizeY) | widget<edit>(RESIZE_X) ||<br />widget<static>("Name", sizeX, sizeY)   | widget<edit>(RESIZE_X) ||<br />widget<list>("Blah", sizeX, sizeY, RESIZE_XY)<br />;<br />toolbar() +<br />button("image1", ...) |<br />button("image2", ...) |<br />separator() |<br />button("image3", ...) |<br />button("image4", ...)<br />;<br /></pre><br />Complete and utter insanity?  Probably, but could be fun to try out.  It would certainly be something different and would create a parallel in your source in comparison to what you would see on screen.  I don&#8217;t think anything quit like it has been tried before, so feel free to steal the idea - it would save me implementing it(!)<br /><br />Enough rambling for today I think&#8230;</div>

It&#8217;s hard to believe this blog has been going for one year as of today.  I can&#8217;t believe I actually remembered this since I never managed to spot my 100th or 200th post.<br /><br />It has been quite a year really.  NC Graphics were taken over by PTC meaning I am now with a third employer working on the same codebase (in four separate stints).<br /><br />Certainly the most popular items on the blog have been the <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/07/tortoisesvn-and-visual-studio.html">TortoiseSVN and Visual Studio integration</a> and recently the <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/08/debugging-stlport-in-visual-studio.html">STLPort debugging in Visual Studio</a>.  Thanks to all the readers and all the comments.<br /><br />I would promise something for the next year or some manifesto, but if it is as action packed as the previous year I somehow doubt I will live up to it.  All I can promise is  if I learn anything interesting about computers I will share it with the rest of the Internet.<br /><br />Normal service will now resume.</div>

Visual Studio 2005 provides a very decent IDE to work with (if you overlook the crashing and disappearing into black holes).  There hasn&#8217;t been much focus on the native C++ side of the IDE for a while, which means it does lack some useful features.<br /><br />One of those tools available for free on the internet is <a href="http://www.cupla.net/CodeWiz2/">CodeWiz2</a> providing a number of very quick and simple additions to the IDE which makes coding a bit easier.  Friend File lets you switch between header and implementation and Friend Member lets you switch between declaration and definition for a single function.  I did have a script that did it, but this works much better (and will at least work on Vista as well since the Macro Explorer was broken last time I tried).<br /><br />It is also scriptable in a manner of speaking meaning you can get common code structures or comments at the tap of a button.  Oh yeah, did I mention it is free?<br /><br />Another free tool available for Visual C++ is <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/RefactorCPP/">Refactor!</a> which you will be surprised to hear offers refactoring for C++.  Only the simplest functionality is available in the free version but it is quite interesting.  I tend to refactor by hand myself, but one useful side-effect of this plug-in is when it highlights all instances of a variable which helps make the code a bit easier to navigate (and should really be a basic feature of the IDE).</div>

I have been doing this blog nearly a year now and certainly in 2007 I have neglected GUI coverage.  The main problem is that there hasn&#8217;t been a huge amount of impressive work on the open-source front and those libraries that showed the most promise are languishing in Sourceforge hell.<br /><br />Maybe Winforms has caught on big-style?  Maybe, but as far as I can tell when you get down to the OS level it still amounts to Win32 function calls, it is just the framework is built on top of that.  Also, many more applications can now be run as web-based applications, with its own plethora of GUI toolkits.<br /><br />Qt is obviously the leader but is only open-source for open-source applications unfortunately (and quite rightly as they do deserve to make money off it).  wxWidgets is not making as massive strides as many would have hoped in order to have really good looking native Windows applications.  The most recent substantial addition was wxAUI that added lots of good stuff like docking.  None of the ideas floating around Boost got off the ground unfortunately, and Win32GUI Generics and Notus and many others are mothballed.  Maybe there needs to be a &#8220;State Of The GUI Union&#8221; post&#8230;<br /><br />I am thinking of doing a small GUI toolkit just to test out the theories and get a better appreciation of the difficulties involved in design and implementation.  It would also mean I could play around with some of my memory allocation and multithreading ideas as part of it.  I&#8217;ve been trying to pull together as much information about Win32 as posible and I&#8217;ll definitely put them all together in one article.</div>

It&#8217;s hard to believe it is nearly October.  The bad part is getting older, the better part though is that the ACCU talk is coming up.  See the website <a href="http://www.accu.org/index.php/accu_branches/accu_cambridge">here</a>.<br /><br />This month is about dynamic languages and is called <span style="font-weight:bold;">&#8220;Closing the Case for Groovy (and Ruby, and Python)&#8221;</span> by <a href="http://www.russel.org.uk/">Russel Winder</a>.  And apparently there will be a related <a href="http://www.pythonforrookies.org/">book</a> that may or may not be out in time for it.<br /><br />Hopefully the week after will have the first <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SPACambridgeEveningMeetingProgramme">BCS SPA Cambridge</a> meeting since the summer as well.</div>

This month&#8217;s ACCU Cambridge &#8220;The Missing Link&#8221; talk was held at the <a href="http://www.displaylink.com/">DisplayLink</a> offices on the 6th of September.  Presenting the talk was Peter Smith who is part of the linker team at <a href="http://www.arm.com/">ARM</a>.<br /><br />The Missing Link talk was about the role of the linker in software development.  The talk detailed the history, the design of, and the use of linkers.  The talk was about an hour long but could easily have gone on longer.  Certainly from the tak I got the impression that the linker is a rather unloved part of the compilation process.  In fact there is really only one book about linkers called &#8220;Linkers and Loaders&#8221; which is available online from <a href="http://www.iecc.com/linker/">this link</a>.<br /><br />The talk itself was entertaining and was at a suitably high level for everyone to understand.   The actual architecture of compilation and linking really has not changed to much throughout its history.  Some of the more interesting parts of the talk were the discussions about name mangling and the reasoning behind it, and the caveats that need to be implemented to get around things like templates in C++.<br /><br />I think there is a plan for the slides to be available online via the <a href="http://www.accu.org">ACCU website</a>.<br /><br />As always though after the event you can learn lots more by going to the pub. A good turnout for the pub was the icing on the cake.<br /><br />The next talk will be about dynamic languages and will be held on the 4th October.  Keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.accu.org/index.php/accu_branches/accu_cambridge"></a>.</div>

<div class="post-content"><div class='post'>
A few months back a document appeared on the Internet about <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2271.html">EASTL</a>.  It details alterations to the STL that Electronic Arts implemented (as well as their own version of the STL) to meet its requirements for standard containers and algorithms.  It has been published on the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2363.html">C++ standardisation website</a> as a reference paper.<br /><br />Some of the ideas in it are very interesting and some are a little naive and lack generality, but the document itself is thoroughly worth it.  The main thrust of the document is efficiency in terms of memory and speed.  This amounts to better allocators, better control of low-level memory (alignment and so on) and intrusive type containers.<br /><br />It covers the deficiencies of std::allocator for EA&#8217;s requirements like the copy semantics and the lack of alignment controls.  It has got me thinking there is a lack of a generic allocator framework that makes it easier for writing pluggable allocators that could be thread local, or global, or thread-safe, or instance-based.  But I&#8217;ll come back to that later.<br /><br />vector bool is not a bit-based array but there is an implementation of a bitvector that gives the same behaviour.  That makes sense to me!<br /><br />The ability to resize a containers capacity to a smaller size and for the storage to respect that as most STL implementations do not do this.  Means memory can be returned back to the system.<br /><br />Apparently the implementation is easy to debug through a simple debugger with no overhead.  I don&#8217;t know whether that is the case in reality but it certainly has its appeal, but I&#8217;m sure it would make plenty of sense in open-source implementations meaning there would be more people able to contribute.<br /><br />Apparently some compilers struggle with inlining so the implementation reduces code complexity to allow less able compilers to inline more.<br /><br />A lot of the motivation behind this is cross-platform in nature and part of that is that the platforms can be limited in memory and processing power.  Some of the ideas brought up are possible in the current STL framework with some minor jumping through hoops, fortunately EA expended the manpower on implementing exactly what they want.<br /><br />Now back to the allocators&#8230;  The ideas make <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=27220&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=eastl&start=25"></a>a lot of sense in this document and I wonder how many are available to coders from the current STL framework.  One thing that requires clarity is what the alignment needs in order to align, by this I mean is it easily determined from the type you are using or is it a combination of that and the machine type.  If so some of the work could be done via type traits like those available through Boost.<br /><br />A lot of the allocator type suggestions do not even have an easy to use reference implementation in the open-source world.  Allocators are so important but there is a lack of availability of those apart from simple HOWTOs for writing allocators.<br /><br />This has got me thinking about actually writing some.  Coming up with a good framework has lead me to reading big stacks of articles online about allocators, and I think there is a good way forward but &#8216;ll leave that to another post.<br /><br />And there is some additional discussion on the Ogre forums <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=35473&view=previous&sid=ce193664e1d3d7c4af509e6f4e2718c6">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=225568&sid=ce193664e1d3d7c4af509e6f4e2718c6">here</a>.</div>

Perhaps naive is the wrong word.  I do wonder how much of the document is aimed at the lowest common denominator compiler, but I suppose the standards of implementation vary massively.<BR/><BR/>Looking at what the next C++ standard is proposing of which the EASTL documentation is informational for they all have a real world basis.  By that I mean almost all of the code and ideas have been tested in the open-source compilers (gcc) and libraries (Boost).  The change being effected on the C++ standard is being dictated by real code by real people.  If they wanted the ideas to become part of the standard it is unfortunate to say since it is proprietary code that some form of reference implementation for people to look at and evaluate.  Obviously there is lots of useful information as part of the document though.<BR/><BR/>EA are also a big organisation and surely can hold some sway with the compiler writers to help solve things like the template problems.  Going back to the compiler quality it is a shame that something like that would hold some better ideas back.<BR/><BR/>I completely forgot the fact that the allocators are not templated.  But I feel using template metaprogramming it must be possible to get more than enough information to construct an allocator that would work on the type traits of the type being allocated.  The platform information would also be required but that would depend which platform you are compiling for.  Maybe I am being naive or misunderstanding some of the theories used to determine type information at compile time.  Since this is done at compile time the efficiency should not take a hit, but maybe code size would.  I do feel that it must be possible to get the allocators to do most of what they want.  The STL is very generic and their use of iterators is a bit specialised.<BR/><BR/>Also things like debugging I have discovered with the very obscure implementation of STLPort you can access all the items with relative ease in Visual Studio.  I don&#8217;t know how many other debuggers have clever scripting languages though.  It is almost like solving a problem at the wrong stage of the process.<BR/><BR/>I do think C++ needs these types of open discussions generated from these types of document.  After all it is the only way any of us would learn.  I certainly wouldn&#8217;t pretend to know more than these guys because they would program me under the table.<BR/><BR/>I don&#8217;t know if I have justified my comments though ;)</div>

Regarding the question of why you need alignment information about a type, EASTL allocators are not templated and thus don&#8217;t know what they are actually allocating. With std STL allocators are templates which are &#8216;re-bound&#8217; to the allocated type and allocator code can often use a compiler &#8220;alignof&#8221; extension to tell what the native alignment of the re-bound type (e.g. node) is.<BR/><BR/>Question: Do you feel that any parts of the EASTL document in particular seem naive?</div>

There are a couple of talks coming up in Cambridge in the next couple of weeks.  We&#8217;re lucky here in Cambridge that there is anything like this to go to as I can&#8217;t find many instances of this throughout the country.<br /><br />First up we have <a href="http://accu.org">ACCU</a> a group striving for professionalism in programming (and there is a fair amount of emphasis on C++).  They have journals released regularly throughout the year which makes membership pretty worthwhile (also membership gives you access to the entire archive online).<br /><br />7:00pm Thursday 6th September 2007 - Peter Smith: The Missing Link, the role of a linker within a software development.  You can sign up to the talk at this <a href="http://www.accu.org/index.php/accu_branches/accu_cambridge">link</a>.<br /><br />Next up is the BCS SPA are going to start there monthly talk programme again after a summer break.  At the moment the talk next week is not known but you can keep an eye out <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SPACambridgeEveningMeetingProgramme">here</a>.<br /><br />Interestingly there will be a talk from <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">Ian Griffiths</a> about WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) on the 14th November.  He is one of the architects behind the whole new graphics interface in Vista.</div>

I&#8217;ve put up a review of the recent ACCU talk about linkers.  The ACCU talks are definitely the most interesting since they are more technical in nature.<BR/><BR/>The first I&#8217;ve heard of this PTC event was from you just now(!)  I notice there is no mention of Pro/TOOLMAKER&#8230;  I don&#8217;t think developers are part of this event.</div>

You&#8217;ve got to tell us how were those talks, and if there are any I should be going to?  Also, are you going to this thing &#8216;ere which appears to have showed up in my spam folder:<BR/><BR/>http://www.ptcworld.org/uki/</div>

From the contents of <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/08/debugging-stlport-in-visual-studio.html">my previous post</a> I have created an autoexp.dat for download (Visual Studio 2005 only).  <a href="http://garry.bodsworth.googlepages.com/autoexp.zip">You can get it here</a>.<br /><br />Simply copy the extracted file into <span style="font-weight:bold;">C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\Packages\Debugger</span><br /><br />Visual Studio 2008 will work if you follow the instructions in my previous post but the autoexp.dat is a bit different between versions.</div>

I am using 5.1.3.  I haven&#8217;t looked at 5.1.4 yet, but I didn&#8217;t think the release notes suggested anything major.<BR/><BR/>I know that certainly with older versions it is completely different because of the use of the &#8220;priv&#8221; namespace.<BR/><BR/>Garry</div>

This used to work for me until I upgraded to 5.1.4. Can you please tell me which version of STLport you&#8217;re running?<BR/><BR/>Thanks!</div>

Glad you have found it useful.  The map took quite a lot of tweaking to make it work on the code I had written to test it.<BR/><BR/>The STLPort map item pointers seem to be a pair{T1, T2} but it is cast to one pointer.<BR/><BR/>The good thing about this ability to visualise means the only reason to switch to the Microsoft STL is gone ;)</div>

This post was very useful to me. I was considering using the Microsoft STL during debug so that I would have the visualizers available. Now I won&#8217;t have to suffer through that! Unfortunately, I was unable to get the map visualizer to work properly, but I am sure that with some tinkering that will be resolved.</div>
