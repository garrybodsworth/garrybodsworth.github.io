<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Reading Code</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s not something like being able to crank out a million lines of code in a year, or to construct the most complex algorithms. Being able to read and comprehend other people&#8217;s code is the most important skill you could need.</p>

<p>Very rarely do programmers get to work in a bubble where they only have their own code to deal with, and most have to work on a legacy system of some sort. In such an environment you need to be able to understand the code in order to simply fix bugs, let alone being able to evolve and add features to the system and codebase.</p>

<p>It also segues nicely into another bugbear of mine, Not-Invented-Here Syndrome. NIH is really a side-effect of being afraid of other people&#8217;s code, but when you have the ability to read a wide variety of code, bug fixing in those external areas isn&#8217;t so frightening. The benefits definitely outweigh the risks of using externally developed code thanks to it typically having many man-years of development being invested in it, leading to a maturity that would be very difficult to reach when starting from scratch (unless the quality was so bad there is no choice). Stand on the shoulders of giants &#8211; it helps.</p>

<p>Another nice side-effect is it helps you respect other people&#8217;s perspective. All those things that annoy you about understanding other people&#8217;s code, remember them and filter them out in your own code. It will mean other people can use your code more effectively. Consistent formatting (I don&#8217;t care where stuff goes so long as it is sane and consistent &#8211; things like braces in C/C++), easy debugging, useful documentation, reusable functionality, and easy testing, should always be aimed for when creating code. It&#8217;s even best to think that way in private pieces of code because you never know when it will end up being public.</p>

For a free tool I think it is pretty great, especially with its very decent user interface on Mac, Windows, and Linux.</p>

<p>The new features for version 2.0 include 64-bit guest support, native OSX user interface, a Qt4 interface, and even a Python programming interface (on Linux and Solaris currently). This release seems a good step forward for the Mac version, so I can play around with VMs on my home computer without needing to spend money on Parallels.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s free, open-source, and does virtualisation, you can&#8217;t complain about having three buzzwords in one sentence <img src='http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

<div class="post-content"><p>A few months back 280 North released an online presentation presentation tool called <a href="http://280slides.com/">280 Slides</a>. The most impressive aspect of which was the user interface that mimicked a full desktop application in look and feel. At the time they promised that the framework used for this (written in Javascript) was going to be released under an open-source licence.</p>

<p><a href="http://cappuccino.org/discuss/2008/09/04/announcing-cappuccino/">Objective-J and Cappuccino</a> have now been released under the LGPL licence. The Cappuccino website is <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">here</a> with lots of information and documentation.</p>

<p>The framework itself is really designed for writing proper applications in the web browser like GMail and 280 Slides rather than simply adding interactivity to web pages. Objective-J provides the basis of the &#8220;language&#8221; adding more features to Javascript non-invasively, then Cappuccino is built on top of it and is more or less a port of the GNUStep/Cocoa frameworks.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see other applications written with these technologies and to see how the way applications in the web browser could change with it. If you look at 280 Slides it is really impressive and now I have tried it in Firefox 3.0 it is really quite snappy (when I tried it a while back in Firefox 2.0 it was a bit more sluggish). This also becomes even more interesting with the new Javascript advancements being made by various browsers like TraceMonkey (Firefox 3.1), SquirrelFish (Safari 4.0), and <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/v8/">V8</a> (Google&#8217;s Chrome).</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>The coverage around Google Chrome hasn&#8217;t died down very much since its release, which is interesting in itself, but the coverage is starting to get more technical and taking it apart.</p>

<p>The post <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/code-reuse-in-google-chrome-browser/">&#8220;Code Reuse in Google Chrome Browser&#8221;</a> looks at al the external libraries used in Google Chrome. Apart from the obvious libraries WebKit and the new Javascript engine V8, there are some more interesting ones. Apparently it uses <a href="http://wtl.sourceforge.net/">WTL</a> for the GUI, which was a Microsoft originated GUI toolkit (with lots of excellent extensions) that ended up becoming open-source. It&#8217;s a very good toolkit for windows and developing for it is relatively painless but it is an interesting choice. Also there is Skia which is a vector graphics engine that is used for the rendering, apparently from an acquisition a few years back.</p>

<p>Alp Toker has blogged a little more in-depth about <a href="http://www.atoker.com/blog/2008/09/06/skia-graphics-library-in-chrome-first-impressions/">&#8220;Skia graphics library in Chrome: First impressions&#8221;</a> with some interesting insights along with some code.</p>

<p>Wired Magazine also have an article <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/16-10/mf_chrome?currentPage=all">&#8220;Inside Chrome: The Secret Project to Crush IE and Remake the Web&#8221;</a> proving that the PR and technical launch have been very successful.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stepanov">Alexander Stepanov</a> (the brains behind the C++ Standard Library) has just posted the latest draft of the first five chapters of his upcoming book &#8220;Foundations Of Programming&#8221; which is co-authored by Paul McJones. You can view the PDF <a href="http://www.stepanovpapers.com/eop/eop.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>He currently works at Adobe and has a remit for providing the formalisation of generic programming techniques. This work also provides the basis for the <a href="http://stlab.adobe.com/">Adobe ASL</a> open-source C++ libraries.</p>

<p>At the <a href="http://accu.org">ACCU</a> Conference earlier this year I attended the the Adobe ASL talks hosted by Sean Parent, where he said about giving Stepanov the job of formalising the ideas behind generic programming. You can read my write-up of the talk <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2008/04/accu-2008-conference.html">here</a>. I found the talk eye opening and interesting and the ideas behind the approach give them a very solid foundation for reusable components.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I like features that make code more concise, manageable and expressive.</p>

<p>I was writing some code in Python that was essentially a function dispatcher where all the functions have the same arguments. When writing them in a more static language you have to specify all the arguments wherever they are forwarded when what you really want to say is take all the arguments and bung them into the next function. Not really a problem with cut and paste, but when you start changing the function protoype you have to make sure you change it in all the related places.</p>

<p>In Python you have the option of using *args which consumes the rest of the arguments of a function and puts them into a list. This meant that I could define lots of the functions which were just forwarding using *args and then pass them into the function being forwarded to using *args.</p>

<p>You can write:<br/>
`</p>

<pre>
foo1('yes', True, 100, 3.14, 'hello world')
def foo1(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5):
    foo2(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5)
def foo2(*args):
    foo3(*args)
def foo3(param1, *args):
    print param1
def foo4(param2, param3, param4, param5):
    print '%s %s %s %s' % (param2, param3, param4, param5)
</pre>


<p><p>`<br/>
foo1() is the long winded way to write it. foo2() just forwards all of the arguments. foo3() takes the first parameter (and prints it) and forwards the four remaining parameters. foo4() finally just prints out the four remaining parameters.</p>

<p>Anyway, the reason I liked it was it removed the horrific evolution overhead of rapidly developing some code. When I wanted to add/remove/consolidate parameters in the code for a lot of related functions using *args made it much simpler to do. You don&#8217;t have to settle for a little less perfect solution because making a minor adjustment is a large amount of work.</p>
