<div class="post-content"><p>I spent an extended weekend in Barcelona and thought I&#8217;d share some photos&#8230;</p>

<p><a title="Barcelona View" rel="lightbox[pics86]" href="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-pan1.jpg"><img class="attachment wp-att-92 alignleft" src="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-pan1.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Barcelona View" width="200" height="88" /></a><br/>
You get quite a nice view from the Montjuic Park, and this is part of the panorama.</p>

<p><a title="PC City" rel="lightbox[pics86]" href="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-pccity.jpg"><img class="attachment wp-att-93 alignleft" src="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-pccity.thumbnail.jpg" alt="PC City" width="200" height="76" /></a><br/>
You only get PC City on the continent, whereas in the UK we get a whole PC World&#8230;</p>

<p><a title="Dunkin Coffee" rel="lightbox[pics86]" href="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-dunkincoffee.jpg"><img class="attachment wp-att-94 alignleft" src="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-dunkincoffee.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Dunkin Coffee" width="200" height="92" /></a><br/>
Apparently you also dunk coffee and not donuts&#8230;</p>

<p><a title="Monstruoso" rel="lightbox[pics86]" href="http://upload.programmerslog.com/monstruoso-poster.jpg"><img class="attachment wp-att-90 alignleft" src="http://upload.programmerslog.com/monstruoso-poster.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Monstruoso" width="139" height="200" /></a><br/>
Cloverfield also gets a much cooler name as I spied in a DVD shop in the airport. I don&#8217;t know why but I always say Monstruoso with a Japanese accent.</p>

<p><a title="307" rel="lightbox[pics86]" href="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-307.jpg"><img class="attachment wp-att-95 alignleft" src="http://upload.programmerslog.com/barcelona-307.thumbnail.jpg" alt="307" width="200" height="160" /></a><br/>
And just because I thought it made an interesting pic.</p>

Why do people leave the safety of a regular wage to go into independent game development? Well, creativity and satisfaction are two good reasons.</p>

<p><a href="http://ciaranwal.sh/2008/08/05/textmate-plug-in-projectplus">TextMate Plug-in: ProjectPlus</a><br/>
Interesting plug-in for TextMate which provides extra functionality including some Git support.</p>

<p><a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/concept-series/">Mozilla Labs >> Concept Series</a><br/>
Mozilla are attempting to generate more discussion for future directions with the Internet. The <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/aurora/">Aurora Concept</a> is generating the most discussion from the design firm <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/">Adaptive Path</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2008-08/">2008 LLVM Developers&#8217; Meeting</a><br/>
Lots of presentations and videos from the LLVM development meeting. It&#8217;s a great technology and is getting a good ecosystem around it, and when <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> reaches production state it will be very interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mysterytales40.com/">Mystery Tales No 40</a><br/>
In Lost there was a brief glimpse of a comic from the 1950s. Some people got hold of it and have scanned it in and analysed it in the context of Lost. But I love Golden Age comics and the scans are fantastic. The creator credits can be read <a href="http://tcj.com/messboard/viewtopic.php?t=4449&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=mystery+tales">here</a> and it features Steve Ditko&#8217;s first ever work for Marvel (or Atlas as it was known then).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.comicmix.com/news/2008/08/02/new-watchmen-posters-echo-originals/">New &#8220;Watchmen&#8221; Posters Echo Originals</a><br/>
These posters are very good. Stuff like this makes me optimistic for the quality, but I can&#8217;t get carried away.</p>

I&#8217;ve never used the desktop ones as the web interfaces have been typically more than adequate, and also switching to WordPress from Blogger was a big leap forward.</p>

A series about virtualisation and what it really means. It made me remember when my brain finally got the concept of virtualisation (see <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2007/10/virtualisation-understanding.html">this old post</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cambridgebusinesslectures.com/video-of-cory-doctorows-talk/">Video of Cory Doctorow’s talk</a><br/>

I like rants that tell you to comment your code. Just because you can understand the intention it does not mean that others will interpret the information in the same fashion.</p>

<p>I bet that these magazines prove hard to get hold of, but I&#8217;ll definitely be up for buying some and then doing some hacking (I&#8217;m sure <a href="http://www.hackaday.com/">Hackaday</a> will have some interesting posts when the time rolls around).

<div class="post-content"><p>Because I&#8217;m a cheapskate even when someone else is paying I was trying to find some three-way merge tools for the Mac, unfortunately my Googling didn&#8217;t turn up anything that doesn&#8217;t appear on other platforms. Obviously you have things like ediff3 in emacs and erm&#8230;.</p>

<p>One that I used extensively on Windows (also available for Linux) is <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/">KDiff3</a>. It&#8217;s a great graphical merge tool, and it works on the Mac. I followed the instructions to integrate it into Git (check out the useful <a href="http://notch8.com/articles/2008/06/06/kdiff3-git-win">post here</a>) but I haven&#8217;t had the mergetool successfully fire it up. When I load the files manually it seems to work fine. It&#8217;ll require some more perseverance. KDiff3 is a great tool though and is a pleasure to use.</p>

<p>I decided to also look at <a href="http://meld.sourceforge.net/">Meld</a> through MacPorts. Unfortunately it has to pull in half the universe like a gravity well, so it was still compiling the dependencies when I decided to call it a day. It looks like a good tool though with all the features you would want, but will no doubt need to run on the X11 platform. Also it is regularly updated which is a good sign. So if I can get it to work expect a post about that&#8230;</p>

<p>FileMerge built into the Mac is only a two way tool, and I did consider the Perform Merge Tool which is available for free. So I think I will persevere with the top two.</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>Unit-testing in Python today&#8230;</p>

<p>Having unit testing built into the language (or at least the standard library) is a good move. With an interpreted language like Python it is invaluable to test the various code paths.</p>

<p>It also helped me find some obvious bugs in my code, which I probably shouldn&#8217;t say in public, entirely because it is embarrassing. That is the first obvious benefit of unit testing. The next benefit is more subtle, you discover how to structure your code in a better fashion because you are thinking about how to test the individual parts of the code.</p>

<p>Unit testing is another option instead of the code checkers PyLint, etc, because the code paths are exercised providing you have written the test. Not perfect, but better than not doing code checking.</p>

<p>The scary thing is you end up with much more testing code than actual executable code. I remember reading somewhere that if that is the case then you are doing something right(!)</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>I heard on the news today that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7532129.stm">BA and Iberia are planning a merger</a>. That isn&#8217;t anything special in the grand scheme of things (especially to a programmer), but they emphasized something interesting, that they would be kept separate brands like they are separate entities.</p>

<p>This never ever happens after a takeover/merger. Promises are made that you will be kept a separate operating entity but as soon as the deal is done all bets are off. Even if it does happen in the short term in the medium term you can guarantee that the job-churning in the board room will mean that previous policies get overturned. Bear in mind the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-02-10-departing-ceos-usat_x.htm">average CEO tenure is five years</a>, and that study is three years old, so imagine it is even less now (since the average was 9.5 years in 1992 and 7 in 2001).</p>

<p>So, if you are ever in a takeover, be aware that unless it is written down and so expensive to get out of that they would never go back on it, it&#8217;s unlikely to turn out the way you would imagine.</p>

An open social wiki-like conference. It should be really interesting to see what subjects appear on the day. Also, I haven&#8217;t got the faintest clue what I could present&#8230;<br/>

<p><a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences">ACCU 2009 Conference &#8211; Call For Participants</a><br/>
A great technical conference run by <a href="http://accu.org">ACCU</a>. They (maybe that should be &#8220;we&#8221; since I am a member) are looking for willing victims (speakers) for next year&#8217;s.</p>

Is it genius or madness?</p>

<p><a href="http://io9.com/5029022/first-glimpse-of-doctor-whos-christmas-villain">Moffat talks Doctor Who at Comicon</a><br/>
Because everyone in the UK is now officially obsessed by The Doctor.</p>

The new Olympic adverts are all over the BBC now, and Jamie Hewlett has provided something truly worth watching.</p>

<p><a href="http://calamityjon.livejournal.com/1051434.html">Origin Of Superman Villains &#8211; McCay Style</a><br/>
Beautiful renditions of the origins of some of Superman&#8217;s rogue&#8217;s gallery by Stuart Immonen. What makes it different is that they are rendered in the style of Winsor McCay&#8217;s Little Nemo in Slumberland. Who said the 90s were a cultural wasteland?</p>

<div class="post-content"><p>The next stage in Python development is &#8220;how do I debug&#8221;.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m at the stage where I keep adding print statements into the code to spot code flows and inspect values (which is nice because you can print more or less anything). But this is an extremely archaic way of approaching it, especially in this day and age&#8230;</p>

<p>Apparently there is a <a href="http://www.ferg.org/papers/debugging_in_python.html">PDB module</a> (there is another nice article <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/lpt/a/6163">here</a>) but it seems to require code changes (an import and where you want to break), not a great deal of fun, especially if you accidentally leave some of this code in. It&#8217;s quite odd that it is not immediately apparent how to have breakpoints or to inspect data values.</p>

<p>Also, because there is a lack of a sanity checker by default you have to run your code and exercise the code paths to test your code. The good thing is that there are a number of programs to help with that, <a href="http://www.logilab.org/857">PyLint</a>, <a href="http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/">PyChecker</a> and <a href="http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes">PyFlakes</a>, so it is not much of a worry.</p>

<p>PyDev has an interactive <a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/debug.html">debugger</a> so this will require much more investigation because it also can integrate PyLint for some error checking.</p>
