Back in the olden days when I was at university I remember one of the projects I had a play with was <a href="http://www.crystalspace3d.org/main/Main_Page">Crystal Space</a>.  I think I discovered it through the old <a href="http://cg.cs.tu-berlin.de/~ki/engines.html">3D Engines List</a>.<br /><br />Finally after ten years <a href="http://www.crystalspace3d.org/main/Crystal_Space_1.0_and_New_Site">version 1.0 of the Crystal Space library has been released</a>.  It&#8217;s great to this see this finally happen as it has been so close for so long (in fat it was pretty usable not long into its development).  One of my favourite technologies it has is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(computer_graphics)">Portal Rendering</a>, this was added because the original version of <a href="http://www.3drealms.com/">Prey</a> (before it got canned and eventually released recently).  At the time it was going to be revolutionary, but I think that style of rendering can produce some cool and crazy effects.</div>

<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> has been going now for getting on to 15 years.  Some of the people developing it and some people using or evaluating it have said that it is old fashioned in design.  This is part of the legacy from being based on a similar design to MFC.<br /><br />Currently wxWidgets makes heavy use of macros in C++, and it also makes a tiny use of STL (after all when development started the STL was not even formalised).  I don&#8217;t think the code is particularly unintuitive or difficult to use, but so much of the API has been set in stone.  One particular area of discussion is the event handling because of the advent of signals and slots.<br /><br />There is a page on the wiki for <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/wiki/index.php/Development:_wxWidgets_3">wxWidgets: The Next Generation</a>.  It is not really actively edited.  I don&#8217;t know whether it will ever get out of the planning stages, I think this is probably due to the fact that the current version is simply good enough to use.  There are other priorities that want/need to be developed, and redesigning the API is not really hugely useful.<br /><br />Other GUI toolkits use some of the more powerful C++ features, but most only use small areas of it.  I think the main advantage of developing a clean API is that it is possible to make many different language bindings.  In fact I think that is what should be aimed at for most modern libraries being developed, because if you can do it in a suitably abstract fashion you&#8217;ll end up with something easily maintainable and as close to future-proof as possible.</div>

One of my guilty pleasures is <a href="http://www.sigames.com">Football Manager (and previously Championship Manager)</a>, it is definitely my favourite type of game - open-ended, considered, and graphics are not the most important part - it is gameplay.<br /><br />On the <a href="http://www.sigames.com">SI Games website</a> there is a forum with a programmers corner.  There is a great little post on the forum by Marc Vaughan (lead developer type guy) about designing a management game.  It covers in quite a lot of depth, although it is not completely finished.</div>

There is a free Linux distribution based on Debian for use on the PS3.  <a href="http://www.keshi.org/moin/moin.cgi/PS3/Debian/Live">This distribution &#8220;Debian Live for PS3&#8221;</a> is available on a bootable CD.<br /><br />It&#8217;s great to see Linux working on consoles legally.  It is good to have Linux working on more platforms, but also the console makers acknowledging the hackers and trying to harness their energy.  Admittedly it is limited by not allowing complete hardware access but at least it is a step forward from the previous generation of consoles.</div>

<a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/feature/?id=14952">This article</a> describes the problems ahead for indie developers on the Vista platform.<br /><br />The new Game Explorer feature seems to be the new point of call for games on the system.  Unfortunately the price to get certificated for it can be substantial when someone is coding in their spare time.  Obviously they can still install them as normal applications but it limits whatever people they are trying to sell to.  Unfortunately, intentionally or not the new way of doing things tilts Windows further away from allowing access to the platform.</div>

The product I work on uses STL in quite an aggressive way and also it permeates all of the source code, so any change to the performance of it can have very severe knock-on effects.<br /><br />We upgraded to Visual Studio .NET 2005 from Visual Studio .NET 2003 with <a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net/">STLPort</a> 4.6.  We decided to make the switch to Microsoft STL which in coding terms was very simple.  This slowed the entire system down massively, especially in debug mode.  I covered in <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2006/10/visual-studio-2005-lets-break.html">a previous post</a> how to gain back some of the performance.  This speeds up the STL by a massive amount as the safe iterator and iterator checking have large overheads.<br /><br />In comparison to STLport the performance in debug is so much slower that it is completely unusable for anything beyond the most simple operations.<br /><br />In release mode the performance is not quite as bad.  For one of our large tests it takes approximately 30000 seconds with our old build system.  With the Microsoft STL with all the possible performance improvements possible the tests took over 36000 seconds to run.  The performance degradation was unacceptable.  It was not only the time but memory as well, with the large data sets we use this causes massive amounts of paging to hard drive.  The Microsoft STL uses about 50% more memory than STLport.<br /><br />Unfortunately STLport is not as easy to debug as the Microsoft implementation is coupled with the debugger.  But the performance degradation is simply too much to ignore.<br /><br />The current version of <a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net/">STLport is 5.1</a> and works with loads of compilers and platforms.</div>

I used SGI STL (the one on which STLPort is based) with VC6, and it was 3 times as fast as  MS STL on average (with up to 7 times in some cases) in release mode. But SGI STL does not compile with newer MS compilers, so I had to switch back to MS STL. Fortunately, I have found STLPort, and now I am back to fast computing!</div>

There really seems to be something wrong with STL in Visual Studio C++ 2005.<br /><br />When we were comparing U++ Core to GCC , MSC 7.1 and MSC 8.0 implementations, MSC 8.0 showed some really weird results, see here:<br /><br />http://www.ultimatepp.org/www$uppweb2$vsstd$en-us.html<br /><br />BTW, -GS- option does quite huge difference for our code.</div>

Hmm, interesting&#8230; And surprising.<br />About the memory side, Microsoft&#8217;s implementation of stringstreams have a memory leak. I don&#8217;t know if that could account for any of the increased memory consumption you noticed. (as far as I know, istringstream and ostringstream are safe to use. It&#8217;s just the general one (std::stringstream) that leaks memory. Can&#8217;t remember the exact details, but it doesn&#8217;t handle multiple inheritance properly (since it inherits from both i- and ostringstream)<br /><br />About debugging, I read somewhere that it&#8217;s possible to get the same support for custom types just by fiddling a bit with some of the configuration files. Of course, now I can&#8217;t remember where I read it. But may be worth a bit of Googling. :)</div>

I was a bit shocked by the results and using STLPort has not only sped up calculation time (we are talking several hours of calculation and a few gigs of memory used) but also helped make the UI more responsive.<br /><br />I thought the comparison between STLPort and MS-STL would have been much closer.</div>

Nope, this isn&#8217;t a post moaning about Vista&#8230;<br /><br />A senior Microsoft Corp executive is worried items he terms as &#8220;craplets&#8221; could damage the perception of Microsoft Vista.  These things he is referring to are the &#8220;added value&#8221; programs that OEMs add to their specific version of the operating system above and beyond what Microsoft supply.  These are the programs like DVD writers and other icons cluttering your new computer&#8217;s desktop that are unnecessary and usually completely rubbish and destructive.<br /><br />You can read the article <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/10/tech-microsoft.html">here</a>.<br /><br />It&#8217;s good to see someone might improve the situation as I spent some of yesterday on a new computer just do uninstalls of tens of programs on a brand new Dell.  These programs were not needed and basically served as adverts.  Also you have to remove the links to various ISPs and the suchlike that you would never switch to.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think this will fix the situation though and perhaps just make the problems more uniform, or they are the same problems with a stamp of approval from Microsoft.  If possible you should always try to get hold of a Windows disc that is Microsoft vanilla and use that for reinstalls.  But beware - you must get the right one for your registration key as there are two types of disc - the OEM and the commercial - and the keys are not interchangeable.  I found this out when finishing a reinstall it would not accept a key as it was an OEM key and it wanted a shop bought one.</div>

When I installed Windows MCE Edition I updated everything to what Windows Update offered.  This included Windows Media Player 11.  When I tried to run media centre it played nothing, not even TV.  Luckily I blamed WMP11 before anything else.<br /><br />I went in search of codecs.<br /><br />I found one particular codec pack that did the job and allows me to play DVDs and everything in my video and music folders, even spotting dolby digital.  This codec pack is The <a href="http://www.cole2k.net">Cole2K Codec Pack</a>.  A simple installer takes all the thought out of doing it which makes it even better.<br /><br />Other ones I found which I didn&#8217;t use are:<br /><a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm">K-Lite Codec Packs</a><br /><a href="http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic=66826">Advanced Vista Codec Pack</a><br /><br />So if you are having problems with video or music playback in Windows try one of these packages and it should ease all your worries.</div>

I&#8217;ve now finally got around to installing Windows MCE on my media centre after fooling around with <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/">Media Portal</a> as my media centre software.<br /><br />My media centre is based on a cheap AOpen XC-Cube with a cheapo Sempron 2600+.  Amazingly it works pretty well the only problem being the transition animations are not too smooth occasionally when running at the highest possible resolution (1280x1024x32bpp).<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been quite impressed with the software.  It is much smoother to set up then the open-source ones I have used in the past, but I don&#8217;t particularly want to use something because it is the path of least resistance.<br /><br />In general the smooth set up and the smooth operation has been better than I expected.  It now works much better with the MCE infra-red keyboard and control, the stand-by operation is much smoother and wake-up ability much better.  Maybe the drivers installed for MCE since it does not necessarily use the same drivers as XP Home/Pro make it more stable?<br /><br />Still after installing it you have to download one round of updates, then 78 updates, then another 13 (at least).  That takes ages - yawn.<br /><br />I&#8217;m actually quite impressed by the associated operating system - it is XP with a lick of paint and extra features.  I have no idea why Microsoft didn&#8217;t use it as an opportunity to release a new version of the OS at the consumer level since MCE is only really for manufacturers.  All manufacturers seem to be using MCE ahead of XP Home anyway now.<br /><br />Overall it has been a very good experience and my wife is finding it easy to use, that is always a good yardstick.</div>

The new <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone">Apple iPhone</a> website has gone live.

There had been recent rumblings that Apple were going to have an embedded version of OS X and this is it.  It looks fantastic, I just hope it runs as well as it looks.  Being OS X you get Safari as your web browser, you can use desktop widgets, and it all looks great.  Hopefully this also means that developers can really go to town, with the benefit of Apple&#8217;s APIs and also being able to do cross-platform development.  Hell, this version of OS X even still supports multitasking.<br /><br />The interface has a keyboard and &#8220;multi-touch&#8221; the touchscreen user interface that is supposed to be really quite impressive.<br /><br />Enough drooling for today I think.</div>
