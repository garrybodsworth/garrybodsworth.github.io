<a href="http://wxformbuilder.org">wxFormBuilder</a> is a RAD designer for <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a>.  It is free and open-source.  It is in the beta phase of version 3.0 and is also supplied as part of <a href="http://wxpack.sourceforge.net/">wxPack</a>.<br /><br />wxFormBuilder is easy to use, simple to look at, and provides a very decent set of features.  It is a standalone system that is simultaneously good and bad, goosd that it requires nothing else, bad because some people require IDE integration.  You can output the designs to XRC (the XML based resource language for wxWidgets) or to native C++.<br /><br />You can see some screenshots of version 3.0 <a href="http://wxformbuilder.org/?page_id=38">here</a>.  The screenshots so some fairly interesting and complex designs demonstrating some of the power of the system.<br /><br />You can see their roadmap for features <a href="http://issues.wxformbuilder.org/?do=roadmap&project=1">here</a>.  They use <a href="http://flyspray.org/">flyspray</a> for their bugtracker (which is a good system).<br /><br />What is particularly nice about this program is the amount of GUI widgets it supports including the contributed ones like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxflatnotebook">wxFlatNoteBook</a>.  I thin it supports enough to create a very good GUI visually.</div>

I believe knowledge wants to be free, it never thrives when it is being stifled by secrecy.  I am an idealist in that regard although I am willing to admit I fail to do enough about it (hopefully I will get around to changing that).<br /><br />My TortoiseSVN integration into Visual Studio is out there because I wanted people to not go through what I did to get it up and running.  Because the project that makes it possible is open-source, there is no reason I should keep something so trivial secret that makes it more useful.<br /><br />It seems that the war is about to begin.  Microsoft have declared that <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/">free software violates 235 of their software patents</a>.  Microsoft are not specific beyond application areas like office applications or email.  The article itself is deliberately inflammatory, especially the choice of pictures and captions.<br /><br />This article is merely a couple of days after <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/090507_Database/09May2007_data05.php">this article</a> in which Microsoft declares that fee software does not exist.  In fact Bill Hilf (of Microsoft&#8217;s Linux Lab) is so wide of the mark it is not funny.  He seems to equate people having jobs means that free software does not exist, and goes so far to say that there is no community when Microsoft are masters at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturfing</a>.   For a start it is Open-Source software and free as in libre software, it is about <span style="font-weight:bold;">knowledge being free</span>, not about the cost being nothing.  Sharing knowledge surely makes a better society.<br /><br />In fact Microsoft are deliberately framing the debate mainly focussing on trying to term it all &#8220;free software&#8221; and trying to make it mean what they say it means.  Microsoft are trying to create a public awareness of people sharing knowledge to create better software being a bad thing by making it sound like it does not really exist and is a corporate conspiracy.<br /><br />Microsoft are treading dangerous ground now because they are going to start alienating people.  Most importantly they will alienate some areas of the development community, I know I have no interest in contributing to anything Microsoft will do, and I plan to steer clear of things like .NET for philosophical reasons.  I started to use VS2005 Express because it is free, but all home development I do from now on will be using non-MS tools (hopefully GCC 4.2 will be out soon).<br /><br />All of this does prove that the doomsayers from the Novell-Microsoft agreement were right on the money.<br /><br />Eben Moglen ( former general counsel to the Free Software Foundation) has given an <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39287036,00.htm">interview here</a>.  He has been instrumental in getting GPLv3 together.  There is an interesting article about <a href="http://www.itmanagersjournal.com/feature/23144">misconceptions about the GPLv3 licence here</a>.  Alex Cox, one of the instrumental developers on Linux has also <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/05/10/223693/linux-guru-backs-new-gnu-licence.htm">given his backing to GPLv3</a>.<br /><br />In almost unrelated news Intel have released <a href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=117876282007989&w=2">more open-source graphic drivers</a>.  Also AMD/ATi have committed to <a href="http://enterpriselinuxlog.blogs.techtarget.com/2007/05/09/amd-will-deliver-open-graphics-drivers/">releasing open-source drivers</a>.</div>

My favourite bugtracker <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/releases/3.0/">Bugzilla has just released version 3.0</a>.<br /><br />New features include custom fields, an XML-RPC interface, per-project permissions, better UTF-8 support and much more.<br /><br />I think the reason that I like Bugzilla so much is that it is a developer&#8217;s bugtracker.  it is not the prettiest or simplest of the bugtrackers out there, but it has masses of useful features and is very configurable.  It really does make a developer&#8217;s life easier since I find it more centred around getting the bugs done and dusted rather than attempting to make it look nice for non-techies.</div>

One of the things we pride ourself with at work is well written code.  In a previous post I have mentioned the code review (also known as peer review) process, but we also use <a href="http://www.gimpel.com/">Lint by Gimpel Software</a> for static C++ code analysis.<br /><br />There was a new article about <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/Test_64-bit_applications.asp">The Problems of Testing 64-bit Applications</a> which is interesting from the point of view that it approaches the problem from a code correctness viewpoint.<br /><br />At the end of the article there is a good selection of links to interesting software, papers and theories.</div>

Here is an interesting <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/06/Cpp/">article about C++ in Visual Studio Orcas</a>.

The first <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1178891375/">alpha release of KDE</a> 4.0 has <a href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/visualguide-4.0-alpha1.php">just been released</a>.  Exciting times are certainly ahead for this desktop environment.<br /><br />At the link you&#8217;ll see some pictures, which are not radically different but do contain the spiffy new Oxygen icon set.  There are improvements to the backend including being based on the latest <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">Qt</a>, and multimedia and hardware support through projects like <a href="http://phonon.kde.org/">Phonon</a> and <a href="http://solid.kde.org/">Solid</a>.<br /><br />The release is expected in October 2007.  Most of the work looks like it will start to concentrate on bringing the apps and the look up to scratch.<br /><br />They are also asking for help to make sure the apps follow the Human Interface Guidelines <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1178743323/">here</a>.</div>

One of the most overlooked programs out there is GCC - <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">The Gnu Compiler Collection</a> - a vast array of development tools that are truly free to use unencumbered.<br /><br />It provides a suite of compilers from Fortran, to Java, to C++.<br /><br />At the moment for Windows unless you use Cygwin (not recommended) you will be using <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a> which is currently at version 3.4.5, some way behind the version available on Unix systems (which is in 4.2 prerelease).  The good news is that once gcc 4.2 is released it will be released for MinGW, which should mean lots of good improvements, from standards compliance to OpenMP to speed ups from new optimisations.<br /><br />Obviously it does not only target specific OSes, but it also targets different platforms including 64-bit.<br /><br />Admittedly it is not as fast the the Microsoft compilers, but maybe it will get there.  One worry is that Microsoft will lose interest in their compilers for native code as they go further and further down the .NET route.</div>

<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2127458,00.asp">Sun announced the open-source Java Development Kit</a> recently.  It&#8217;s under the GPLv2 license and it looks like they want to capture the open-source community.<br /><br />This could be a really interesting period since Java may start to gain even more traction as more people become involved in its development.  Hopefully meaning slicker VMs being released.<br /><br />OpenBSD are currently merging this <a href="http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20070508192340">release into their codebase</a>.  I imagine others will not be far behind.  I hope it means that it becomes well supported on many platforms.<br /><br />You can see the OpenJDK website <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">here</a>.</div>

Went to another talk from the <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">BCS SPA Cambridge group</a>.  There is a talk every month and they are normally well worth attending, there is certainly nothing else I have found like it elsewhere.  As usual they are hosted at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/cambridge/">Microsoft Research, Cambridge</a> with a buffet.<br /><br />This month&#8217;s talk was about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMMI">CMMI</a> hosted by  Kieran Doyle of Lamri.  I must admit I had no idea what CMMI was before going to this talk, only what it was an acronym for.  For the first half of the talk I had no idea what was going on as it covered the history of it, and did not explain what it actually was.<br /><br />Eventually we got onto the nitty gritty of this thing was.  I&#8217;d have to see what the benefits were in reality but the premise of itself is admirable, especially in a larger corporation.  Overall, I actually learnt something that is a plus, and also the at the talk we got free 512Mb USB keys - not half bad.<br /><br />Anyone interested in computing in the Cambridge area should check out these talks.</div>

An interesting new blog is out there about physics-based animation.  You can go and read it <a href="http://animationphysics.wordpress.com/">here</a>.<br /><br />It is mainly from a gaming perspective but I think that most of the theory can be applied to engineering as well.  A lot of great theory comes out of the gaming arena and they certainly share ideas a lot more than the engineering arena.</div>

I think that part of the theory coming from this is that it is thought about from a practical real-world use standpoint.  It is always possible to come up with the ideal solution but I would say it very rarely works in the real world without an extremely small problem domain.</div>

Well, to be fair it&#8217;s really coming more from an academic computer graphics and film/visual effects standpoint, since a lot of the stuff there isn&#8217;t really fast enough to be incorporated into real-time games (though might be soon, with GPU&#8217;s going the way they are). But I definitely agree with your point about theory coming out of the graphics world; there&#8217;s a lot of smart people in graphics these days, and I think it&#8217;s more and more plausible that some of what gets developed will feed back into the computational mechanics and fluid dynamics communities.</div>
