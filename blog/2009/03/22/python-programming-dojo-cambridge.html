            <h1>Python Programming Dojo &#8211; Cambridge</h1>
Sun 22 March 2009

        <div><p>Yesterday I ran the Python Programming Dojo in Cambridge. It was my first time running such a public speaking event. We had four people in attendance which made it a bit easier on me after four or five last minute drop-outs.</p>
<p>Basically, it was to cover getting started in Python development from first concepts through to more advanced ones. I can hardly believe I talked more or less continually for six hours(!) I had prepared cue cards so I didn&#8217;t forget any subjects I wanted to cover and had smushed together a load of examples to go with each subject.</p>
<p>One of the most bizarre things was I didn&#8217;t get onto the fact Python had classes until lunchtime at 1pm&#8230;. It was hard to try and cover the basics because everything relied on something else, so I was dynamically juggling the order of the subjects.</p>
<p>The best bit was the interaction where people were coding whilst I was talking and the discussion points and questions came out of that.</p>
<p>I found it really hard to explain list comprehensions because I kind of instinctively knew them, but I had managed up until now to never need to explain them.</p>
<p>The benefits of doing this class were many for me. First, up I had programmed in Python for a while but I just did it and didn&#8217;t really think about why and how much I had used. Organising those thoughts was invaluable. Also, had to do speaking at the front of the room and I think I did okay apart from waving my hands too much and using the word &#8220;mad&#8221; too often in the description of Python features&#8230; The other benefit was I learnt some things as well.</p>
<p>The main Python feature I learnt was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern">flyweight</a> pattern feature of Python classes. Basically if you define a variable as part of the class you maximise reuse of that object. If you defined a variable using self, it will be added to the class dictionary. We checked this by writing code which is the best way to learn.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I will end up running one again or if it is a one-off, but I will try to update my examples and subjects to reflect what I discovered throughout the day (if I actually transfer them to digital format rather than hand-written cards I&#8217;ll post it on here).</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to thank <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/">Red Gate Software</a> for supplying refreshments and somewhere to host it, <a href="http://blog.software-acumen.com/">Mark Dalgarno</a> for organising it, and Clive Tong of Red Gate for making sure we could get in (and not forgetting the attendees).</p></div>
