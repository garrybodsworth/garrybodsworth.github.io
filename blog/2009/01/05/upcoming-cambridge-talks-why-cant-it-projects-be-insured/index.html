<div class="post-content"><p>Another month, another BCS SPA talk. The next SPA Cambridge meeting will take place on Wednesday 14th January at Microsoft Research Centre, Cambridge.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/WhyCantITProjectsBeInsured">Why Can&#8217;t IT Projects be insured?</a><br/>
<strong>Graham Oakes</strong><br/>
<em>January 14th 2009, 7:00pm (light buffet) 7:30pm (talk)</em><br/>
Venue: <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/MicrosoftResearchCentreCambridge">Microsoft Research Centre Cambridge</a></p>

<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>

<p>Many organisations, especially small to medium businesses and public sector bodies, are failing to initiate valuable projects. They read statistics such as the Chaos Reports and get scared of the risks of project failure. They talk to IT companies and get confused by the technical jargon. They don&#8217;t trust the consultancy industry to help them navigate this maze. So they don&#8217;t initiate projects that might actually deliver a lot of value. Or if they do initiate projects, they bound them with such tight &#8220;risk mitigation&#8221; practices &#8211; heavyweight procurement processes, long contractual negotiations, burdensome project oversight structures &#8211; that an atmosphere of mistrust and bureaucracy is built in from the outset. This, perversely, increases the risk of failure even further, creating the conditions for an escalating &#8220;cycle of mistrust&#8221;.</p>

<p>This mistrust hurts all of us. Organisations are forgoing potential benefits. Developers are forgoing potential work. Or if we do get work, it&#8217;s set up for failure from the outset.</p>

<p>In the film industry, insurance is used to mitigate some of this mistrust. Independent film producers often need to arrange &#8220;completion bonds&#8221; in order to obtain financing for their films. These are effectively insurance policies that projects will deliver on time and on budget. The financier pays a premium to an independent third party (the guarantor), who then monitors the project and ensures it stays on track. And if it doesn&#8217;t, then the guarantor repays the original financing.</p>

<p>Could this work for IT projects? This talk will look at the role of the guarantor, and the way they might help break the cycle of mistrust in many of our current IT projects. I don&#8217;t have definitive answers, but I do have some thoughts and many questions, so I hope we&#8217;ll have an interesting discussion.</p>

<p>Graham Oakes helps people untangle complex technology, relationships, processes and governance. As an independent consultant, he helps organisations such as Sony Computer Entertainment, The Open University, the Council of Europe and the Port of Dover to define strategy, initiate projects and hence run those projects effectively. Prior to going independent, he was Director of Technology at Sapient Limited, where he ran the project review process for the UK Business Unit. Before that he was Head of Project Management for Psygnosis Ltd (a subsidiary of Sony), where he ran Independent Project Assurance teams working across the UK, Europe and the USA. His book &#8220;Project Reviews, Assurance and Governance&#8221; was published by Gower in October, 2008.</p>
