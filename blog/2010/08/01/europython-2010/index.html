<div class="post-content"><p>Last week I attended EuroPython 2010 without contracting food poisoning like last year. It was four days of talks, food and beer. Before I completely forget everything I thought I&#8217;d write up my experience. This is the last year in Birmingham and next year it heads to Florence but PyCon UK will carrying on.</p>

<p>I also did not only end up sketching such luminaries as Optimus Prime, Megatron, Robocop, Death&#8217;s Head (1 and 2), and Judge Dredd, I actually took some notes as well(!)</p>

<p>This write up has taken me a few weeks since my iPhone4 died completely then my Macbook Pro decided to contract the nvidia graphics chip of death.</p>

<p><strong>Russel Winder &#8211; The Multicore Revolution</strong><br/>
The everything you&#8217;ve held true all this time is going to change speech. Russel was thoroughly entertaining as usual especially with the sidetrack into physics. He stepped in at the last minute for someone dropping out going to OSCON or something, but if they hadn&#8217;t said noone would have known or complained.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Idiomatic%20Python">Idiomatic Python/Python Tips and Tricks</a><br/>
This was the talk of the conference (there was a second part later I unfortunately missed because it overran). Basically everyone in the audience no matter how expert they were in Python will have learnt something. It rattled through at great pace. Stuff I learnt included:<br/>
Copying a sequence c = s[:]<br/>
Delete a sequence s[:] = [] or del s[:]<br/>
Iterating an array using enumerate() means you get a pair of index, value<br/>
Iterating multiple sequences with zip() means you keep the arrays in lockstep<br/>
You can do a for &ndash;> else</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/The%20Development%20Process%20Of%20Python">Python Development Process</a><br/>
I simply had to go to this because now I am thinking about the process to merge my changes I have made in <a href="http://github.com/garrybodsworth/coda_network">coda_network</a> back upstream since they seem to be working quite nicely now.</p>

<p>The branches are:<br/>
3.2 &#8211; branches/py3k<br/>
3.1 &#8211; release31-maint<br/>
2.7 &#8211; release27-maint<br/>
2.6 &#8211; release26-maint</p>

<p>To do an update and compile of the source do ./configure &amp;&amp; make<br/>
Or you can do a debug version by ./configure &#8211;with-pydebug &amp;&amp; make<br/>
And you only need make if the C files have changed.</p>

<p>Writing tests is extremely important, so write them check they fail, fix the problem and re-run the tests to make them work! You should run your tests with Lib/Test/regrtest.py</p>

<p>To run all tests do ./python -m test.regrtest -uall and to do a specific test replace uall with the test name.</p>

<p>Apparently there is a maintainers file under Misc/maintainers.rst which should be very useful.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/How%20Import%20Works">How Import Works</a><br/>
I went to this because it can never hurt to know what is going on int he background. It covered some of the new functionality including relative imports which you can get at on older versions by doing &#8220;from __future__ import absolute_import&#8221; then you can do funky stuff like &#8220;from ..spam import flying_circus&#8221;.</p>

<p>So the process of doing import:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resolve the name.</li>
<li>Find the module, it is possible to create custom finders that can drag your package from anywhere like the internet.</li>
<li>Then do a loader.load_module(fullname) and you&#8217;ve got it.</li>
</ul>


<p>They are putting in a __pycache__ where all the .pyc files go so you can use multiple interpreters without conflicting .pyc files and also they don&#8217;t get left around on your hard drive because they are all in one place. It helps prevent having stale .pyc files that can be accidentally imported.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Platform SIG</strong><br/>
This was an impromptu talk because there were quite a few drop-outs for talks. I decided to go because I feel Windows stalking me at every turn and I can only run away for so long.</p>

<p>The most interesting part was reimplementing UNIX commands in Python for some self contained non-administrator helpful commands.</p>

<p>Also mentioned was <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a> for generated Python documentation and <a href="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">Homebrew</a> for Mac OSX to get a slightly better dev environment.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Testing%20Http%20Apps%20With%20Python3">Monstrum &#8211; Python HTTP testing in Python 3</a><br/>
Seems to be testing by using HTTP headers.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Porting%20To%20Python%203">Porting Python 2 to 3</a><br/>
One thing I wrote on my notepad was &#8220;Hiding to nothing&#8221;. I seem to remember thinking it requires a lot of effort and the ideal solution could conceivably be the most work which is a codebase that works in 2 and 3.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Muddle%20Inventing%20A%20Build%20System">MUDDLE &#8211; A Build System</a><br/>
Muddle is a build system for building embedded systems written in Python. Considering my day job I could not miss out on this one since it is very relevant. It supports lots of VCS, and build systems (make, linux kernel, apt-get, initscript, version files, debian files). Basically, I need to find the time to really experiment with this and attempt to build a system.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Kbus%20A%20Simple%20Messaging%20System">KBUS &#8211; A simple messaging system</a><br/>
This is a messaging system using a Linux kernel module. It is modelled on a socket model which is really easy to wrap your head around. The testing is all done in Python which makes it really powerful to use. It is definitely worth considering over dbus as that is really incredibly painful. I know some uses for this already myself after the pain of dbus and dbus-python.</p>

<p><strong>Open Standards &#8211; Democratising The Web</strong><br/>
Bruce Lawson from Opera had the keynote about open standards on the web. He gave this <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2006/pas-78-guide-to-good-practice-in-commissioning-accessible-websites/">interesting link</a> about accessibility. He also mentioned the media queries for CSS to layout your content from different resolution screens and physically shaped devices. Also he mentioned <a href="http://www.html5patch.org/">html5patch</a> for cross browser html5.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/A%20Case%20For%20Accessibility">A Case For Accessibility</a><br/>
This is a subject close to my heart so there was no way I was going to miss this. They designed <a href="http://getmediacore.com/">Mediacore</a> with accessibility in mind.</p>

<p>The W3C says 10% population in most countries has a disability and the average age of the population is increasing such that the rate will get higher. They found actually seeing people with disabilities attempting to use the web through screenreaders and the suchlike made them see how hostile the web is (I am looking at you Tescos after your redesign, but that is a whole other article).</p>

<p>Things you should be thinking about are:<br/>
Order of menu items and in fact number of menu items.<br/>
Alt text for images &#8211; people still don&#8217;t do this!<br/>
Form labels<br/>
Tab order<br/>
Headlines and paragraphs are semantic and help<br/>
Hiding things right. display:none does not necessarily work with screen readers.</p>

<p>Some accessibility guidelines are available <a href="http://northtemple.com/1608">here</a>.</p>

<p>And something even closer to my heart, reduce or eliminate Adobe Flash completely.</p>

<p>It is also easy to partner with a visual disability centre, like for instance the RNIB or Sense. There is also some Non Visual Accessibility web certification.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Html5%20The%20Good%20The%20Bad%20And%20The%20Quite%20Interesting">HTML5: the good, the bad and the quite interesting</a><br/>
And this talk was really quite interesting. Just talking about the new things that are getting added to the HTML standard (the title is really honestly for marketing).</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve got new things like a header element that can go anywhere, and a nav element to contain say a group of links. You can tag something article which is a discrete piece of content. There is now a time element to unambiguously mark something as a time and date.</p>

<p>Interestingly (although Opera is the only browser implementing it right now) is form validation so you can have HTML smart forms which flag up to the user when something needs attention.</p>

<p><strong>First Round Of Lightning Talks</strong><br/>
There was the face tracking robot called Hedroid that delighted the audience. We had a talk about how the mobile interface for the schedule was knocked up in a pub and deployed in about an hour. There was the pyweek game development challenge. The online pygame book. And a few more.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Python%20And%20Windows%20Equality">Python On Windows</a><br/>
Just to see how Python is getting on in the world of Windows and what real world stuff people are doing with it. CPython from the standard installer seems to work well for most people and there are a few useful packages like active_directory, wmi, and pywin32.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Python%20In%20The%20Browser">Python In The Browser</a><br/>
This is web programming using Silverlight + ironPython. It&#8217;s an interesting thing to see and looks like it could make Windows development more palatable. There is a really good demo <a href="http://www.trypython.org/">here</a> for the Python tutorial code executed in the browser. The useful addresses are gestalt.ironpython.net/dlr_runtime.js to get python in the browser using Gestalt and silverlight.codeplex.com for the Silverlight Toolkit.</p>

<p>Like I say I see Windows stalking me in dark alleys&#8230;.</p>

<p>The State Of Python<br/>
Another day, another keynote. Interesting bits from the talk included <a href="http://badassjs.com/post/745778955/skulpt-python-implementation-in-javascript">Skulpt</a> which is an implementation of Python in Javascript. Also there was <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/berp-0.0.1">Berp</a> which is Python 3 in Haskell that compiles down to Haskell. Also a mention was made of <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute">distribute and pip</a> which should help with the minefield of deployment.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Organise%20A%20Python%20Code%20Dojo">Organise a Python Dojo</a><br/>
An entertaining talk about how the London Coding Dojos started with a strict <a href="http://codingdojo.org/">adherence to the rules</a> and how they evolved into what they are now. They have things like multi-week projects divided into small units (like a text adventure game). I think what I really took away is start with the default arrangement then find what works with the type of people.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Adapting%20Libraries%20To%20Twisted">Twistify Your Library</a><br/>
And<br/>
<a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Deferred%20Gratification">Deferred Gratification</a><br/>
I think I sat in these because I lacked the ability to stand up and it was nice and air conditioned. What I really learnt is Twisted deserves its name and it is implemented in completely the wrong language. My sketch involved Judge Dredd declaring &#8220;Guilty! The sentence is death!&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/The%20Guardian%20Api%201%20Year%20On">The Guardian API One Year On</a><br/>
This was about the kind of things the Guardian API is now capable of and how it is the antithesis of the newly implemented Murdoch Paywall. The first example was an online version of the paper which can be viewed <a href="http://guardian.gyford.com/">here</a> and there was the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/zeitgeist">zeitgeist example</a>. Basically there are <a href="http://guardian.mashery.com/">three levels</a>, keyless for simple access, approved to get at the actual data, and bespoke for full access with no ads. They have also opened up a large variety of data in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog">Guardian Datablog</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/Talks/Gevent%20Network%20Library">gevent library</a><br/>
This is a library for large multithreaded programs. It is a lot more sensible than Twisted and fits into the Python semantics a lot better. It still needs a lot of work for various other python features like subprocesses.</p>

<p><strong>More Lightning Talks</strong><br/>
I did a talk about <a href="http://github.com/garrybodsworth/coda_network">coda_network</a> and fixing up httplib and urllib2.</p>

<p>There was a quick one about <a href="http://bit.ly/__main__">__main__.py</a> which was really interesting because you can do all kinds of packaging like adding all the files to a ZIP and making it work. Creating a __main__.py means you can execute a Python library which is really cool.</p>

<p>There was a talk that mentioned all kinds of hackery you can do with the with statement. One library is <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/withhacks">withhacks</a>.</p>

<p>There was a really cool demo of pdb++ a new funky python debugger. I think the repository is <a href="http://github.com/antocuni/pdbpp">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve skipped some bits of Europython because I simply had Python overload and I am sure important stuff got pushed out of my brain.</p>
