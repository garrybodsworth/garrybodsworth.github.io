            <h1>Recent Cambridge Talks</h1>
Tue 02 December 2008

        <div><p>I&#8217;ve been a bit lax recently so I thought I&#8217;d do a whistlestop tour of the talks I&#8217;ve been to over the past month.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cambridgebusinesslectures.com/">Tim Campbell &#8211; Cambridge Business Lectures</a><br />
Covered a lot of ground up from his start in business, through the Apprentice, up to his current venture. What you can tell from his talk is that he is doing what he wants to do now rather than what is expected of him. His current venture is a registered charity that helps young people start up business mainly if they are from disadvantaged backgrounds. I must admit business oriented talks don&#8217;t really do it for me and this was no exception because it always ends up being about the bottom line.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/WhenGoodArchitectureGoesBad">When Good Architecture Goes Bad &#8211; BCS SPA Cambridge</a><br />
For the restart of the Cambridge BCS SPA meetings we have Mark Dalgarno&#8217;s talk. I&#8217;ve attended <a href="http://garrys-brain.blogspot.com/2008/04/accu-2008-conference.html">this one before</a>. The talk is an interactive session where you have to spot architectural decay and how to stem it and possible reverse it. It&#8217;s a good session for getting to know your fellow attendees as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.software-east.co.uk/">Model Driven Development and Software Product Lines &#8211; Software East</a><br />
There were two talks for the fee here. First up there was <em>Danilo Beuche &#8211; Get started with Software Product Lines</em>. This covered the theory behind building up a software product line and also showed some of the tool that is used to manage it through Eclipse. It is much more relevant for companies with many products all containing small variations. The second talk was <em>Steven Kelly &#8211; Moving from Coding to Model-Driven Development</em>. This was the stronger of the two talks. The way I read it was that it is a large layer of abstraction to improve productivity and to ower thebarrier for entry for solving problems in the problem domain. The examples mainly involve diagrams (or UML) for it but I think a good DSL would do the trick as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chase.org.uk/?q=node/258">Liquavista &#8211; CHASE Cambridge</a><br />
This was a talk about new monitor technology company and how you bring technology to market. It was about using electrowetting to make reflective displays (rather than the current backlit world). If the technology does take off you will get cheaper displays and lower power displays. They are currently pushing out actual product in watches in order to have something on the market rather than simply relying on being a technology and licensing company with no released product.</p>
<p>Upcoming there is <a href="http://www.bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/VisualStudioExtensibility">Visual Studio Extensibility: Extend Your Development Experience</a>.</p></div>
