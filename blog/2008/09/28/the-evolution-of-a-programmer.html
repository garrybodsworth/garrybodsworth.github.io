            <h1>The Evolution Of A Programmer</h1>

        <div><p>Sometimes you look at where you are now and think &#8220;How did I get here?&#8221;, currently it is in a good way but certainly in difficult times you think &#8220;How the hell did I get here?&#8221;. Certainly thinking back to when I started working as a developer I would never have predicted I&#8217;d be doing what I am now.</p>
<p>Back in 2000 I started out as a C++ developer on Windows for user interface work. The user interface was MFC which will strike fear into the hearts of some programmers, and the source control system was Visual SourceSafe (bear in mind the initial release of Subversion was around the same date I started). This was the initial baptism in commercial realities of development and my first interaction with real talented developers who actually got software out of the door.</p>
<p>In 2002 I experienced my first takeover. My job description didn&#8217;t really change although I wasn&#8217;t a graduate any more. The type of development work I was doing was moving out of the original GUI type work into a more generalised area. Even at one point I ended up deploying a bug database company-wide running a custom version of Bugzilla, which was equal parts interesting and a complete nightmare.</p>
<p>In 2005 I went back to my original company, and this was where my development career started to get much more interesting. During that time I worked on the building blocks of the system and dipped into areas that would not have been seen as my comfort area like the serious heavy maths. I ended up trying to learn more and push myself, after all people out there have solved the same problems, so I joined <a href="http://bcs-spa.org/cgi-bin/view/SPA/SpaCambridge">SPA Cambridge</a> and <a href="http://accu.org">ACCU</a>. During this period at work I moved the company over to Subversion, re-vamped the build system and installer, and got the 64-bit release done.</p>
<p>After another takeover I decided it was time to move on again, and to hopefully continue learning. Unfortunately this move didn&#8217;t work out, although I did pick up a couple of things during that time, and learnt a bit about what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>This leads me to my current job at <a href="http://www.camvine.com">Camvine</a> where I am learning lots of new stuff. This means I am having a huge amount of fun. Also, because it is a start-up, the company is of a size and mentality that makes me feel at home. In the space of about ten weeks(ish) I&#8217;ve had to learn Python, new technologies, lots about networking, and (finally) lead an almost Microsoft free lifestyle.</p>
<p>So, since starting my professional career in October 2000, in (almost) October 2008 I am getting to do work I suppose I would have dreamed of if I knew it was what I wanted to do. I think it shows that your career can evolve into unexpected and exciting areas.</p></div>
